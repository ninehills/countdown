Let's start by thinking about the operations. Maybe subtract some numbers first. Since 98 is a big number, if I subtract something from it, maybe that's part of the solution. Let me try 98 minus something. Let's see, 98 minus 14 is 84, but that's still bigger than 67. If I subtract 93 from 98, that's 5. Then maybe add 14 and 3? Wait, but I have to use all numbers. Let me write down the numbers: 93, 14, 3, 98.\n\nAnother approach: maybe combine some numbers with multiplication or division. Let's see, 14 divided by 3 is roughly 4.666, but not sure if that helps. What if I do 93 minus something? 93 minus 14 is 79, which is still higher than 67. Then maybe subtract 3 and 98? Wait, but I can't do that because all numbers must be used once. Wait, maybe I need to group them into different operations.\n\nWait, what if I take 98 and subtract 3, which is 95. Then subtract something else. If I subtract 93 from 95, that's 2. Then add 14? 2 +14 is 16. No, that's not 67. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 98 divided by something. 98 divided by 14 is 7. Then 7 multiplied by 3 is 21. Then 93 minus 21 is 72. Not 67. Close though. Maybe different operations.\n\nWhat about 93 minus (14 + 3) which is 93 -17=76. Then 98 -76=22. Not helpful. Wait, but I need to use all numbers. So maybe 98 - (93 - 14) /3. Let's check: 93-14=79. 79 divided by 3 is about 26.333. Then 98-26.333=71.666, which is not 67.\n\nWait, maybe 93 - (98 - 14)/3. Let's compute that. 98-14=84. 84 divided by 3 is 28. 93-28=65. Close to 67 but not quite. Hmm.\n\nWhat if I rearrange the operations. Let's try 14 multiplied by 3 is 42. Then 98 minus 42 is 56. Then 93 minus 56 is 37. Not helpful. Or 93 minus 98 is -5. Then -5 +14=9, then 9*3=27. Nope.\n\nWait, maybe (98 - 93) is 5. Then 5 multiplied by 14 is 70. Then 70 -3=67. Oh! That works. Let's check: (98 -93) =5. Then 5 *14=70. Then 70 -3=67. But wait, all numbers must be used. Let's see: 98,93,14,3. Yes, all are used once. So the equation would be (98 -93) *14 -3 =67. Let me verify that:\n\n98 minus93 is 5, multiply by14 gives 70, subtract3 gives 67. Yes! That works. So the equation is (98 -93) *14 -3 =67.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(98 - 93) * 14 - 3 = 67</answer>"}]}

Hmm, let's start by thinking about possible combinations.\n\nFirst, since there are two 81s, maybe I can subtract them? Like 81 - 81, but that gives 0, which might not be helpful here. Wait, but I have to use all four numbers. So maybe I need to combine them with the other numbers, 72 and 57. Let's see.\n\nWhat if I group some numbers together? For example, 72 divided by something. Let's try 72 divided by (81 - 57). That would be 72 / (24) = 3. Then if I subtract that from 81, 81 - 3 = 78, which is way off. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe combine the two 81s first. If I do 81 * 81, that's a huge number, 6561, which probably isn't useful. Maybe 81 + 81 = 162. Then subtract 72 and 57? 162 -72 -57 = 162 -129 = 33. Not 15.\n\nWait, maybe using division in a way to reduce numbers. Let's see. Let's take 57 and 72. 57 is a prime number, but 72 can be divided by 9, 8, etc. Hmm. 72 divided by something. If I do 72 divided by (81/81), that's 72 /1 =72. Then subtract 57? 72-57=15. Wait, but I have to use both 81s. Wait, because 81/81 is 1, so that uses one 81 each. So that would be using 72, 81, 81, and 57. Wait, but 72 divided by (81/81) is 72, then subtract 57: 72 -57=15. But that uses 72, 81, 81, 57. But the original numbers are two 81s, so that's allowed. Let me check: numbers used are 81, 81, 72, 57. Yes, all four numbers. So the equation would be 72 / (81 / 81) - 57 = 72/1 -57 =15. That seems to work. Let me verify:\n\nFirst, 81 divided by 81 is 1. Then 72 divided by 1 is 72. Then 72 minus 57 is 15. Yes! That works. All numbers used once each (even though there are two 81s, but the problem states we can use all numbers, including duplicates).

The target is 134. Let me think about possible combinations. Maybe start with the largest number, 80, and see how I can adjust it with the others.\n\nIf I subtract something from 80, what would get me close? 80 - 11 = 69. That's too low. If I add instead: 80 + 11 = 91. Still low. Maybe multiply? 80 * 11 is 880, way too big. Maybe 80 plus something else. Let's check another approach.\n\nWait, 37 is a big number too. Maybe combine 80 and 37 first. 80 + 37 = 117. Then 117 plus what? 117 + 28 = 145. Then subtract 11? 145 -11=134. Oh! Wait, let me check that again. 80 +37 is 117. Then 117 +28 is 145. Then 145 -11 is 134. But have I used all numbers? Let's see: 80,37,28,11. Yes, all four. So that would be (80 + 37 + 28) -11. Let me calculate that again: 80+37=117; 117+28=145; 145-11=134. Yes, that works! But wait, do I need to use all operations? The problem says use each number once, but operations can be used multiple times. So in this case, adding three numbers and subtracting one. So the equation would be 80 + 37 + 28 -11 =134. That seems valid. Let me check once more: 80+37=117, 117+28=145, 145-11=134. Yep. That uses all four numbers once each, and operations are +, +, -. So that's allowed. So the equation is (80 + 37 + 28) -11 =134. But the problem allows using the operations multiple times. So maybe write it as 80 + 37 +28 -11. Either way, that works. Let me see if there's another way, but this seems straightforward. Alternatively, could there be another combination? For example, multiplication. Maybe 28 and 11: 28*11=308. Then 308 -80=228, but that's too big. Maybe 37* something. 37*3 is 111, but 3 isn't available. Alternatively, 80 - (something). 80 - (37-28) =80 -9=71, then 71*11=781, way off. Not helpful. Another approach: 80 * (11 - (37/28)). Let me compute 37/28≈1.321. 11 -1.321≈9.679. Then 80*9.679≈774, not close. Hmm. Maybe divide one of the numbers. Like 80 /11≈7.27. Then 7.27 *37≈269, plus 28 is 297. Not helpful. Alternatively, 28/11≈2.545, then 80 -2.545=77.455, then 77.455*37≈2865, which is way over. Not helpful. So the first approach seems better. Let me check again: 80 +37=117, +28=145, -11=134. Yes. So the equation would be 80 +37 +28 -11 =134. So that's the answer.\n</think>\n\n<answer>80 + 37 + 28 - 11 = 134</answer>"}]}

Hmm. \n\nFirst, I should think about the target number 880. Let me check if it's a multiple of any of these numbers. 822 is a big number, so maybe subtracting something from it? Let me try 822 - something. If I subtract, say, 55 from 822, that gives 767. Not close. Maybe add? 822 + 55 is 877. Still not 880. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe multiplying some of these numbers. Let's see: 28 and 55. 28*55 is 1540. That's way too big. 85*55 is 4675. That's way over. 28*85 is 2380. Still too big. So maybe multiplication isn't the way to go unless combined with other operations.\n\nWhat about division? 822 divided by something. 822 / 85 is approximately 9.67, which isn't helpful. 822 / 28 is about 29.36. Not useful. Maybe 85 divided by 55, which is about 1.545. Still not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps combining addition and subtraction. Let's think: 822 is the largest number.

Let's calculate that: 28 +85=113, 113+55=168. 822 +168=990. That's too much. \n\nAlternatively, maybe 822 - (85 +55) = 822 -140=682. Then 682 +28=710. Not 880. \n\nWhat if I group numbers differently. Let's think of 85 and 55. 85 +55=140. Then 140 * something? 140*6=840, which is close to 880. But how to get 6 from 822 and 28. Wait, 822 divided by 28 is 29.357. Not 6. Maybe 28 - (822 / something else). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 85 -55=30. Then 30 * something. 30*29.333=880. But 29.333 is 88/3. Not sure. \n\nWait, another approach: 880 divided by 85 is approximately 10.35. If I can make 10.35 using the other numbers. 822, 28, 55. Hmm. Not obvious. \n\nWait, let's try combining 82 and 28. 822 - 28 = 794. Then 794 +85=879. Close to 880. Then 879 +1=880. But where do I get 1? Maybe using 55 somehow. Like 55/55=1, but I already used 55. Hmm. No, because each number can be used only once. \n\nAlternatively, maybe 822 - (85 - 55) *28. Let's compute that. 85-55=30. 30*28=840. 822 -840= -18. Not helpful. \n\nWait, 85 *55 is 4675. That's way too big. 822 +28=850. 850 +85=935, +55=990. Again, same as before. \n\nWait, maybe (822 - 55) * something. 822-55=767. 767 *1.147=880.

Let me check:\n\nSo 55 -28 =27. Then 85 -27=58. Then 822 +58=880. But the numbers used are 55,28,85, and 822. Yes! All used once. So the equation would be 822 + (85 - (55 -28)) =880.

Let's look at the numbers given: 44 is the largest, followed by 32, 21, and 20. If I multiply 44 by something, maybe that's a start. 44 times 9 is 396. But how can I get 9 from the remaining numbers 21, 20, 32? Let's see. Wait, 21 minus (32 divided by something?) Let me check. 32 divided by 20 is 1.6. Then 21 - 1.6 is 19.4. That's not 9. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 44 multiplied by (something with 32 and 21 and 20). Let's see. Let's think about 32 and 20. If I add them, that's 52. 52 multiplied by something. 52 * 8 is 416, which is higher. If I subtract 20 from 32, that's 12. Then 12 * 44 is 528, which is way higher. Maybe I need to combine operations.\n\nWait, perhaps using division to reduce some numbers. Let's try 21 and 20. 21 * 20 is 420. If I subtract 32 from that, 420 - 32 = 388. Then 388 + 44 = 432. Not 396. Or maybe 21 + 20 = 41. 41 * 10 is 410, but 10 isn't here. Alternatively, 32 divided by 20 is 1.6.

I need to create an equation using the numbers 608, 79, 98, and 42, each exactly once, with basic arithmetic operations to get 827. Hmm. Let me start by thinking about what operations might get me close.\n\nFirst, 827 is a large number. The biggest number I have is 608. If I can add something to 608 to get close to 827, that might work. Let's see: 827 minus 608 is 219. So I need to make 219 from 79, 98, and 42. Hmm. Let's see. Let's check if those three numbers can combine to 219. 79 + 98 is 177, plus 42 would be 219. Wait, 79 + 98 +42 = 219. But wait, that's using all three numbers. So 608 + (79 + 98 +42) = 608 + 219 = 827. But wait, the problem requires using each number exactly once and all of them. So that would use all four numbers: 608 plus the sum of the other three. But the equation would be 608 + 79 + 98 +42 = 827. But that's using each number once and all of them. But wait, the problem says \"create an equation that equals 827. You can use basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) one or multiple times but each number can only be used once, and you must use all the numbers.\" So adding them all together is an option. Wait, 608 +79 is 687, +98 is 785, +42 is 827. So yes, just adding all four numbers gives 827. Wait, wait, let me check that:\n\n608 +79 = 687\n\n687 +98 = 785\n\n785 +42 = 827. Yes! So the equation is 608 +79 +98 +42 =827. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Did I miscalculate? Let me check again.\n\n608 +79: 600+70=670, 8+9=17 → 670+17=687.\n\n687 +98: 687 +100=787, minus 2=785.\n\n785 +42: 785 +40=825, +2=827. Yes, that adds up. But maybe the problem expects using different operations, not just addition? Because otherwise, this seems straightforward. Let me check the initial problem again. It says \"You can use basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) one or multiple times but each number can only be used once, and you must use all the numbers.\" So it's allowed to use addition multiple times, as long as each number is used once. So the equation 608 +79 +98 +42 =827 is valid, using only addition. But maybe the problem wants a more complex equation, but the user probably just wants the correct answer. Let me see if there's another way, but maybe this is the simplest.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me check if adding all the numbers gives exactly 827. Let me sum them up step by step.\n\n608 +79: 608 +70 is 678, plus 9 is 687.\n\n687 +98: 687 +90 is 777, plus 8 is 785.\n\n785 +42: 785 +40 is 825, plus 2 is 827. Yes, correct. So adding all four numbers gives exactly 827. Therefore, the equation is just the sum of all four numbers. So the answer would be 608 +79 +98 +42 =827. But let me check the rules again. The problem says \"create an equation that equals 827. You can use basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) one or multiple times but each number can only be used once, and you must use all the numbers.\" So addition is allowed multiple times. Each number is used once. So this equation satisfies all conditions. Therefore, this is the correct answer. I don't think I made a mistake here.

The biggest number here is 92. If I subtract something from 92, maybe? 92 minus something equals 128. Wait, that's not possible because 92 is smaller than 128. So maybe adding 92 and something else. 92 + 53 is 145, which is too big. 92 +17 is 109, still not enough. What if I multiply some numbers?

But since we have to use all numbers, maybe break it down into parts. Let's see. 53 and 17, if I subtract them, 53-17=36. Then 92 minus 36 is 56. That's not helpful. Wait, maybe 53 + 17 is 70. Then 92 - 70 =22. Still not 128. How about 92 + 53 =145. Then 145 -17 =128. Oh, wait! 145 -17 is 128. But then I need to use all numbers, including 1. So maybe 92 +53 -17 -1. But that would be 145 -18 =127. Not quite. Alternatively, 92 + (53 -17) +1? 92 +36 +1=129. Close, but no. Hmm.\n\nWait, the 1 is tricky. Maybe use division with 1. Since dividing by 1 doesn't change the number. So perhaps (92 +53) -17 /1. Wait, 92+53 is 145. 17/1 is 17. So 145 -17 =128. Yes! That uses all numbers: 92, 53, 17, and 1. Let me check: 92 +53 =145, then 17 divided by 1 is 17. 145 minus 17 is indeed 128. So the equation would be (92 + 53) - (17 / 1) =128. Let me make sure all numbers are used once: 92, 53, 17, 1—yes, all used. And the operations are addition, division, and subtraction. That works. So the answer is (92 + 53) - (17 / 1).\n</think>\n\n<answer>(92 + 53) - (17 / 1)</answer>"}]}

Hmm, that's a big number, 910. Let me think about how to get there.\n\nFirst, maybe multiplication is key here because 910 is pretty large. Let's check the numbers: 21 and 13 are the bigger ones. If I multiply them, 21*13 is 273. Then we have 10 and 3 left. Even if I multiply 273 by 10, that's 2730, which is way bigger than 910. So maybe not just multiplying all the big numbers together.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a way to combine them with addition or subtraction. Let's see. 910 divided by, say, 10 is 91. So if I can make 91 with 13, 3, and 21, then multiply by 10. Let's try that. 13*7 is 91, but how to get 7 from 21 and 3? 21 divided by 3 is 7. Oh! So 13*(21/3) is 13*7=91. Then multiply by 10. So the equation would be (13 * (21 / 3)) * 10. Let me check that.\n\n21 divided by 3 is 7. Then 13*7 is 91. 91*10 is 910. Perfect! But let me make sure I used each number exactly once. 13, 21, 3, and 10 are all used once. The operations are division, multiplication, and another multiplication. That should work. Let me write that down: (13 * (21 / 3)) * 10 = 910. Yeah, that seems right. I don't think I missed any numbers, and the operations are allowed. Let me just verify the calculation steps again. 21 divided by 3 is 7. 7 times 13 is 91. 91 times 10 is 910. Yep, that adds up. I think that's the solution.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(13 * (21 / 3)) * 10 = 910</answer>"}]}

I need to use all the numbers 69, 23, 50, and 78 exactly once each with basic operations to get 312. Hmm, 312 is a bit of a big number, so maybe multiplication will be involved. Let me think about possible combinations.\n\nFirst, looking at the numbers: 78 is the largest, followed by 69. 50 and 23 are smaller. Let me see if multiplying 78 by something gets close. 78 times 4 is 312. Oh wait, 78 times 4 is exactly 312. So maybe I can get 4 from the other numbers. Let's see, the remaining numbers are 69, 23, and 50. How can I make 4 with those?\n\nLet's try 69, 23, and 50. Hmm, 69 minus 23 is 46. Then 50 divided by (something). Wait, 50 divided by (69 - 23) would be 50 / 46, which is about 1.08... Not 4. Maybe subtract first. 50 minus (69 -23) is 50 -46=4. Oh, that's interesting. So 50 - (69 -23) equals 4. Then if I take 78 multiplied by that result, it would be 78 * 4 = 312. Let me check that:\n\nFirst, compute 69 -23 = 46. Then 50 -46 =4. Then 78*4=312. Yes! So that uses all the numbers once each. Let me write that out as an equation:\n\n78 * (50 - (69 - 23)) = 312.\n\nBreaking it down step by step: 69-23=46, 50-46=4, 78*4=312. All numbers used once. That should work.

Maybe using division or addition somewhere else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 69 times something. 69*4=276, which is less than 312. 69*5=345, which is over. So maybe not. How about 50? 50*6=300, which is close. 300+12=312. But how to get 12 from 78,23,69? Maybe 78 - (69 +23)=78-92= -14, which isn't helpful. Alternatively, 23 - (78-69) =23 -9=14. Not 12. Hmm. Not sure. Alternatively, 78 divided by something. 78/23 is about 3.39, which doesn't help much. Maybe combining 50 and 23. 50+23=73. Then 73*4=292. Not enough. 73*4.27 would be 312, but that's not an integer. Maybe subtraction: 50*6=300, then 300+12=312. But where does 12 come from? 78-69=9, 23-9=14. Not 12. Maybe 23 - (78-69)=23-9=14. Still no. So maybe the first idea is the best.\n\nAnother approach: 69 +23=92. 78-50=28. 92*28=2576, way too big. Not helpful. Alternatively, 50*6=300, 300+12=312. Wait, 12 could be 23 - (78/6.5), but that's using fractions and not the numbers properly. Alternatively, 78 divided by (something). If I use 78/(something) as part of the equation. Not sure.\n\nWait, let me check the first solution again. 78*(50 - (69 -23)). Let's compute step by step:\n\n69-23=46. 50-46=4. 78*4=312. Yes. All numbers used once. That works. So the equation is 78 * (50 - (69 - 23)) = 312. So the answer would be written in the required format. Let me make sure there's no parentheses mistake.

So maybe I can use 40 as part of the equation but still combine the other numbers in a way that the total is 40. But how?\n\nLet me think. If I have 40 as part of the equation, maybe subtract something or add something. For example, 40 plus (something) minus (something else) equals 40. But then I have to use 13, 26, and 2.

No good.\n\nAlternatively, maybe multiply or divide. Let's see. If I take 26 divided by 13, that's 2. Then I have 2 and another 2. So 2 * 2 = 4. Then 40 * (something with 4?) Wait, but how do I combine all of them. Let me try:\n\n(26 / 13) is 2. Then 2 * 2 is 4. Then 40 - 4 would be 36. Not 40. Or 40 + 4 = 44. Still not. Hmm.\n\nWhat if I do 40 * (26 - 13 * 2).

All numbers must be used once, and I can only use +, -, *, /. Hmm. Let me start by thinking about the target number, 367. It's a bit over 300, so maybe I can find a way to subtract some of the larger numbers or combine them to get close.\n\nFirst, looking at the numbers: 566 is the largest. If I subtract something from 566, maybe that could get me close. Let's try 566 minus something. 566 - 33 is 533. Still too high. 566 - 84 is 482. Hmm. 566 - 66 is 500. So maybe 566 minus (some combination of the other numbers) could work.\n\nWait, but I need to use all four numbers. So maybe 566 minus (some operation with 84, 66, and 33). Let me think. Let's see, 84 and 66 are both in the 60s and 80s. If I add 84 and 66, that's 150. Then if I subtract 33, that's 117. Then 566 - 117 would be 449. Not enough. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe multiply some numbers. Let's see. If I take 84 and multiply by 66, that's a big number: 84*66 = 5544. Way too big. But maybe divide that by something. Like 5544 divided by 33 is 168. Then 566 - 168 is 398. Still not 367. Close, but not there.\n\nWait, maybe another approach. Let's see, 367 is 300 + 67. So maybe 300 from some combination and 67 from another. Or perhaps 84 is a good starting point. Let's see, 84 * 4 is 336. But we don't have a 4. Wait, maybe 84 * something. 84 * 4.375 is 367.5, which is close. But how to get that with the numbers given. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 566 divided by something. 566 divided by 2 is 283. Then adding 84 would get to 367. But how to get 2 from 33, 66, and 84. Let's see, 66 - 33 = 33. 84 divided by something. 84 divided by (66 - 33) is 84/33 ≈ 2.545. That's not 2. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps (84 - (66/33)) = 84 - 2 = 82. Then 566 - 82 = 484. Not helpful. Maybe 566 - (84 + 66) = 566 - 150 = 416. Then subtract 33: 416 -33=383. Still not 367.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe using division in a different way. For example, 566 divided by 2 is 283, but again, how to get 2. Alternatively, 66 divided by 33 is 2. Then 84 * 2 = 168. Then 566 - 168 = 398. Then subtract 31 more to get to 367. But 31 isn't available. Wait, but we still have to use all numbers. Wait, if I use 66 and 33 as 66/33=2, then 84*2=168. Then 566-168=398. But then how do I use the remaining number? Oh, wait, 66 and 33 are already used in the division. So that's all numbers used? Wait, 566, 84, 66, 33. If I do 566 - (84*(66/33)) = 566 - (84*2) = 566-168=398. But that's 398, not 367. Hmm. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 566 - 84 = 482. Then subtract 66: 482-66=416. Then subtract 33: 383. Not there. Alternatively, 566 - (84 +66 +33) = 566 - 183=383. Still no.\n\nWait, maybe multiplication and addition. Let's see, 33 * 84 = 2772. That's way too big. Maybe divide by something. 2772 / 66 = 42. Then 42 + 566 = 608. Not helpful.\n\nHmm. Let's try a different approach. Let's think of 367 as 360 +7. Maybe 360 comes from 6*60, but not sure. Alternatively, 84*4 + something. Not sure. Let's see, 84*4=336. Then 336 + 31=367. But 31 isn't available. Wait, but we have 33 and 66. 66 - 33=33. So 336 +33=369. Close, but not 367. Then subtract 2? But where to get 2. Maybe 33 - (something else). Wait, this might not be the right path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using 566 divided by 2. Let's see, 566/2=283. Then 283 + 84=367. Wait, 283+84=367. Exactly! So how to get 283 from 566 divided by 2. But where do the other numbers come in? Because I have to use all numbers. So if I do 566 / (66/33) = 566/2=283. Then 283 +84=367. That uses all numbers: 566 divided by (66 divided by 33) plus 84. Let me check: 66 divided by 33 is 2. 566 divided by 2 is 283. 283 plus 84 is 367. Yes! That works. So the equation would be (566 / (66 / 33)) + 84 = 367. Let me verify the numbers: 566, 66, 33, 84. All used once. The operations are division and addition.

Maybe start by looking at the larger numbers and see how they can contribute. The largest number here is 137, followed by 93, 40, and 9. \n\nLet me try combining 137 and 93 first. If I subtract them: 137 - 93 = 44. Hmm, 44 is not too far from 40, which we have. But 44 and 40 would give 84, which doesn't help much. Alternatively, adding them: 137 + 93 = 230. Then we have 40 and 9 left. 230 + 40 = 270, then 270 - 9 = 261. Wait, that could work. Let me check:\n\n137 + 93 = 230  \n230 + 40 = 270  \n270 - 9 = 261  \n\nSo the equation would be 137 + 93 + 40 - 9. But wait, does that use all numbers? Yes: 137, 93, 40, and 9. Each used once. And the operations are all addition and subtraction. That seems to work. Let me verify the arithmetic:\n\n137 + 93 is indeed 230. 230 + 40 is 270. 270 - 9 is 261. Yep, that's correct.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure there's no other way. Maybe another combination. Let's see, perhaps using multiplication. For example, 93 multiplied by something. 93*3 would be 279, which is close. But we don't have a 3, but we do have 9. 9 divided by 3 is 3, but we don't have a 3. Alternatively, 93*2.8 would be around 260.4, but that's not exact. Hmm, that might not be helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 40 times 6.525 is 261, but how to get 6.525 from 9, 93, 137? That seems complicated. Probably not the right path.\n\nAnother approach: 9 * 29 = 261. How can I get 29 from 93, 40, 137? Let's see, 137 - 108 = 29. But 108 can be made from 93 + 15, but 15 isn't directly available. Alternatively, 137 - (93 + 40/ something). Let's see, 137 - 93 = 44. Then 44 - (40/ something). If I do 44 - (40 / (9 - ...)), but this is getting too convoluted.\n\nWait, the first approach seems straightforward and works. So maybe that's the answer. Let me check again: 137 +93 is 230, plus 40 is 270, minus 9 is 261. Yes. So the equation would be (137 + 93) + 40 - 9. But since addition and subtraction are left to right, parentheses might not be necessary. So just 137 + 93 + 40 - 9 = 261. Each number used once, all operations allowed.

I need to create an equation using all the numbers 79, 71, 54, and 23 exactly once, with basic operations, and the result should be 142. Hmm. Let me start by thinking about the target number. 142 is a bit over 140. Let's see what combinations of these numbers could get close.\n\nFirst, maybe adding some of the larger numbers. 79 and 71 are both in the 70s. Adding them together would give 150. That's 8 more than 142. So 79 + 71 = 150. Then maybe subtract something. But I have to use all the numbers. Wait, 54 and 23 are left. If I subtract 54 - 23, that's 31. 150 - 31 is 119. Not enough. Alternatively, maybe 150 - (54 +23) = 150 -77=73. That's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe multiply some numbers. Let's see. 79 -71 is 8. Then 8 multiplied by something. 8 * 54 is 432, which is way too high. If I divide by 23, 432 /23 is around 18.78. No. Not helpful.\n\nWhat if I subtract 71 from 79 first? 79-71=8. Then maybe use 54 and 23. Let's see. 54 divided by 23 is roughly 2.348. If I multiply that by 8, that's around 18.78 again. Not 142.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 79 + 54 = 133. Then I need 9 more. But then I have 71 and 23 left. 71 -23=48. 133 +48=181. No. Alternatively, 71 +23=94. 133 -94=39. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe 79 + (71 - (54 -23)). Let's compute inside the parentheses first: 54 -23=31. Then 71 -31=40. Then 79 +40=119. Still not 142.\n\nAnother approach: think of division. Let's say if I can create a division that gives a certain number. For example, 54 divided by something. Maybe 54/(23) which is roughly 2.348. Then multiply by (79-71)=8. 2.348*8≈18.78. Not helpful.\n\nOr perhaps 79 * (something) = 142. 142 divided by 79 is about 1.8. So maybe 79*(54/(71-23)). Let's see. 71-23=48. 54/48=1.125. 79*1.125≈89. Not 142.\n\nWait, maybe 71 multiplied by something. 71*2=142 exactly. Oh! So if I can make 71 multiplied by 2, that would be 142. How to get 2 using the remaining numbers: 79, 54, and 23.\n\nWait, 79 - 54 =25. Then 25 -23=2. So combining those: 79 -54 -23=2. Then 71*(79 -54 -23)=71*2=142. That uses all numbers: 71,79,54,23, each once. Let me check:\n\n71*(79 -54 -23) = 71*(2)=142. Yes! So that works. Let me verify the order of operations. The subtraction is done left to right, so 79-54=25, then 25-23=2. Then multiplied by 71. So the equation is 71*(79 -54 -23)=142. Alternatively, written as 71 × (79 - 54 - 23). Since subtraction is associative left to right, the parentheses are necessary to group the subtractions first. Yes, that's correct. All numbers used once.

I need to create an equation using the numbers 44, 7, 19, 24 exactly once each, and the result has to be 7. Hmm. Let me start by thinking about how to combine these numbers with basic operations.\n\nFirst, since the target is 7, maybe I can use the 7 directly somehow. But I still need to use the other three numbers: 44, 19, and 24. So maybe 7 is part of the equation, but the other numbers need to cancel out or combine to make 0 or 1 so that when multiplied or added with 7, it stays 7. For example, if I can get (something) * 7, but then that something needs to be 1. Or maybe (something) + 0. Let's explore that.\n\nLooking at the other numbers: 44, 19, 24. Let's see if any combinations can result in 0 or 1. Let's try 44 - 19 - 24. Wait, 44 minus 19 is 25, minus 24 is 1. Oh! So 44 - 19 -24 equals 1. Then if I take that 1 and multiply by 7, that would give 7. So the equation would be (44 - 19 -24) * 7. Wait, but does that use all numbers? Let me check. Yes: 44, 19, 24, and 7. Each used once. So (44 - 19 -24) equals 1, then multiplied by 7 is 7. That seems to work. Let me verify:\n\n44 - 19 is 25. 25 -24 is 1. 1 *7 is 7. Yes, that's correct. So the equation is (44 -19 -24) *7. But wait, do I need parentheses here? Because without them, the operations would be left associative. Let me make sure the order is correct. The subtraction is left to right, so 44-19 is 25, then minus24. Then multiply by 7. So yes, the parentheses would group the subtractions first. So the equation would be ((44 -19) -24) *7, but maybe written as (44 -19 -24) *7. That should be acceptable. Let me check if that's valid.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: Maybe 24 divided by something. Let's see, 24 divided by (something) to get 1, but not sure. Alternatively, 44 divided by something. 44 divided by 19 is about 2.3, which doesn't help. 44 minus 24 is 20. 20 plus 19 is 39. 39 divided by... Hmm, not helpful. \n\nAnother idea: Maybe 19 - (44 / (24 -7)). Let's compute that. 24-7 is 17. 44 divided by 17 is approximately 2.588. Then 19 minus that is around 16.41, which is not 7. Not helpful. \n\nWhat about 24 - (44 / (19 -7))? 19-7 is 12. 44/12 is about 3.666. 24 -3.666 is around 20.333. Not 7. \n\nAlternatively, 44 - (24 +19) = 44 -43=1, then 1*7=7. Wait, that's similar to the first approach. 44 -24 -19 equals 1, then multiplied by 7. So that's the same as (44 -24 -19)*7. Which is the same as (44 -19 -24)*7. Either way, the order of the subtractions doesn't matter here since it's all left to right. So that equation uses all four numbers once. \n\nI think that's the correct answer. Let me check again. 44-19 is 25. 25-24 is 1. 1*7 is 7. Perfect. All numbers used once. So the equation is (44 -19 -24) *7.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(44 - 19 - 24) * 7</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using the numbers 40, 7, 50, 10 exactly once each, with basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) to get 890. Hmm. Let me start by thinking about how these numbers can combine.\n\nFirst, 890 is a pretty large number, so probably multiplication will be involved. Let's see. Let's try to get as close as possible. The largest numbers here are 50 and 40. If I multiply them, that's 50*40=2000. That's way larger than 890. Maybe I need to combine them with subtraction or division. Alternatively, maybe combine 50 with another number first. Let's see.\n\nWait, 50*7 is 350. 350 plus 40 is 390. That's too low. How about 50*10=500. Then 500*7=3500, which is way over. But maybe subtracting something. Hmm. Wait, but I have to use all four numbers. So I need to use 40,7,50,10 each once.\n\nLet me try different combinations. Let's see:\n\nIf I do 50 * (40 - 7), that's 50*33=1650. Then 1650 -10=1640. Not 890. Not helpful.\n\nWhat if I do 40 * 50 = 2000. Then subtract something. Let's see, 2000 - (7*10)=2000-70=1930. Still too high.\n\nAlternatively, 50*7=350. Then 350 +40=390. Then 390*10=3900. No, way too big.\n\nWait, maybe combining 50 and 10 first. 50+10=60. Then 60*7=420. Then 420*40=16800. Way too big.\n\nAlternatively, 50-10=40. Then 40*40=1600. But I already used 50 and 10, and 40 again. Wait, but we can only use each number once. So that's not allowed. So maybe that's not possible.\n\nWait, perhaps division can help. Let's see. 50 divided by something. If I do 50/(10) =5. Then 5*7=35. Then 35*40=1400. Still not 890. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, 40*7=280. Then 280 +50=330. Then 330*10=3300. No. Not helpful.\n\nWait, 890 divided by 50 is 17.8. Hmm. So maybe 50 multiplied by something around 17.8. How to get 17.8 using 40,7,10. Let's see. 40 - (10/7) is approximately 40 -1.428≈38.57. 50*38.57≈1928.5. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (40 + 7) * something. 47*19=893. Close to 890. How to get 19? Using 50 and 10. 50 - (10 / something). Wait, 50 - (10 /1) =40. Not helpful. Hmm.\n\nWait, 47*18.936≈890. So maybe 47* (50 - (10/ something)). Let's see. 10 divided by 7 is approximately 1.428. Then 50 -1.428=48.571. Then 47*48.571≈2272. Not helpful.\n\nHmm. Maybe subtract instead. Let's think: 50*10=500. Then 7*40=280. 500+280=780. 780 is still 110 less than 890. Hmm. Not sure.\n\nWait, 50*7=350. Then 350*2.542≈890. How to get 2.542 from 40 and 10. Maybe 40/10=4, but 40/10=4. Then 4 + something? 4 is from 40/10, but that uses 40 and 10. Then 4*7=28. 28*50=1400. No.\n\nWait, maybe 50* (10 +7) =50*17=850. Then 850 +40=890. Oh! Wait, that uses 50,10,7,40. Let me check: 10 +7=17. Then 50*17=850. Then 850 +40=890. But wait, I just used 50,10,7,40. All numbers once. So the equation would be 50*(10+7)+40=890. Let me verify: 10+7=17. 17*50=850. 850+40=890. Yes! That works. So the equation is 50*(10+7) +40=890. But let me check if all numbers are used once: 50,10,7,40. Yes, each used once. Perfect. So that's the solution.\n</think>\n\n<answer>50 * (10 + 7) + 40 = 890</answer>"}]}

Each number has to be used exactly once, and the result should be 650. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let me list out the numbers again to make sure I have them right: 72, 65, 65, 3. Hmm, there are two 65s. Since each number can only be used once, but since they are both 65, maybe that's allowed. Wait, the problem says each number can be used only once. Wait, but the numbers given are 72, 65, 65, 3. So maybe the two 65s are considered separate numbers even though they have the same value. So I have to use each of them once. So I can't use both 65s together unless they are separate instances. But maybe the problem counts them as different numbers because they are provided as separate entries. So I have to use each of the four numbers: 72, 65, 65, and 3, each exactly once.\n\nThe target is 650. Let's think about possible operations. Multiplication might be needed here because 650 is a fairly large number. Let's see. Let me try to break down 650 into factors. 650 divided by 10 is 65. Wait, we have two 65s. Maybe that's a clue. For example, 65 multiplied by 10 gives 650. But how to get 10 from the remaining numbers: 72 and 3. Let's see. 72 divided by 3 is 24. That's not 10. 72 minus 3 is 69, which doesn't help. Alternatively, 72 - 3* something... Hmm. Wait, if I need 10, maybe 72 - 62 = 10, but 62 isn't here. Alternatively, maybe 72 - (65 - 3) = 72 - 62 = 10. But then I would have used 65, which is part of the numbers. Wait, but that would use 65 and 3, which are separate numbers. Wait, let's think step by step.\n\nIf I take 65 * (something) = 650. Then the something would need to be 10. So how can I get 10 from 72, 65, and 3. Wait, but I have two 65s. Wait, if I use 65 twice, but each instance must be used once. Wait, the problem says to use all the numbers, so each of the four numbers: 72, 65, 65, 3. So maybe one 65 is used in the multiplication to get 650, and the other 65 is used elsewhere. Wait, this seems conflicting. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe combine some numbers. For instance, 72 + 65 = 137, but not sure. Maybe 72 * 65. Let me calculate 72*65. 70*65=4550, plus 2*65=130, total 4680. That's way bigger than 650. So that's too much. Maybe division. 72*65 divided by something. For example, 72*65 = 4680. 4680 divided by 7.2 is 650. But 7.2 isn't one of the numbers. Alternatively, maybe 72 * (65 / something). Let's see 65 divided by 3 is about 21.666. Then 72*21.666 is about 1560, which is higher than 650. Hmm.\n\nWait, let's think about the target number 650. Let me see if I can get to 650 by adding or subtracting. For example, 65*10 is 650. So if I can make 10 from the remaining numbers: 72, 65, and 3. Let's see, 72 - 65 = 7, then 7 + 3 = 10. So that would be 65*(72 - 65 + 3). Wait, but I need to use all four numbers once each. Let's check: 65 is used once here, 72 once, 65 again, but that would be using 65 twice. Wait, but we have two separate 65s. So if I have two 65s, can I use each once? So in this case, the equation would be 65 * (72 - 65 + 3). Let me compute that:\n\nFirst, compute the parentheses: 72 - 65 = 7, then 7 + 3 = 10. Then multiply by 65: 65*10=650. But wait, the numbers used here would be 65, 72, 65, and 3. But the original numbers are 72, 65, 65, 3. So each is used exactly once. So yes, that works. Let me check again:\n\n65 * (72 - 65 + 3) = 65 * (7 + 3) = 65 * 10 = 650. So the numbers used are: first 65, then 72, then the second 65, then 3. So all four numbers are used once. That seems to fit the criteria. So the equation would be (65 * (72 - 65 + 3)). Let me verify:\n\n72 - 65 is 7. 7 + 3 is 10. 65 * 10 is 650. Yes. That works. So that's a possible solution. Alternatively, maybe another way, but this seems to work. Let me check if there are other possible equations, but this one seems straightforward.\n</think>\n\n<answer>65 * (72 - 65 + 3) = 650</answer>"}]}

I need to use the numbers 1, 46, 52, and 26 each exactly once, combining them with basic arithmetic operations to get 23. Hmm. Let's start by thinking about possible combinations.\n\nFirst, 23 is a prime number, so maybe division or subtraction could be involved. Let's look at the numbers given. 46 and 26 are both even. 52 is also even. 1 is the smallest. Let's see if I can pair some numbers.\n\n46 divided by 2 is 23. Wait, but 2 isn't in the list. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe 46 divided by something else. Or 52 minus something. Let's see. 52 - 26 is 26. That's not helpful. 52 - 46 is 6. Hmm.\n\nWait, if I use 26 and 1. 26 minus 1 is 25. Close to 23. But how to get the other numbers in. Alternatively, 46 divided by 2 is 23, but I don't have 2. Maybe I can make 2 from the other numbers. Let's see: 26 divided by 13 is 2, but 13 isn't there. Alternatively, 52 minus 26 is 26. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe combining 52 and 26 in some way. Let's try 52 divided by 26. That's 2. Then if I can use that 2 with 46. 46 divided by 2 is 23. Then I have 1 left. Oh, but how? Because I have to use all numbers. So 52/26 gives 2. Then 46 divided by (52/26) would be 46 / 2 = 23. Then the 1 is left. How to incorporate the 1?\n\nWait, maybe 1 is subtracted or added. For example, 23 + 1 = 24, which isn't helpful. Or 23 -1 =22. But I need to use all numbers. So maybe the equation is (46 / (52/26)) -1 = 23 -1 =22. No, that's 22. Not 23. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe (46 / (52/26)) +1 would be 23 +1=24. Not right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe multiply 1 somewhere. Let's see. (46 / (52/26)) *1 =23. But then I'm using 46,52,26, and 1. Wait, that's all numbers. Wait, 52 divided by 26 is 2, then 46 divided by 2 is 23. Multiply by 1. But multiplication by 1 doesn't change it. So 23 *1 =23. So the equation would be (46 / (52 / 26)) * 1. But does that count? Because technically, all numbers are used: 46, 52, 26, and 1. Let me check the order of operations. 52 divided by 26 is 2. Then 46 divided by 2 is 23. Then multiplied by 1 is still 23. So that works. So the equation is (46 / (52 / 26)) * 1 =23. But do I need to arrange all numbers in a way that each is used once. Let me verify. 46,52,26,1 are all used once. Yes. So that's a possible solution.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way. Let me check another approach. For example, 26 - (52 - 46) /1. Let's compute: 52-46=6. Then 6/1=6. 26-6=20. Not 23. Hmm. Or 52 - (46 -26)/1. 46-26=20. 20/1=20. 52-20=32. Not 23.\n\nHow about 46 -26 - (52 /1). That's 20 -52= -32. Nope. What if I do (52 - 46) * something. 52-46=6. Maybe 6 multiplied by 26? 6*26=156. Then divide by 1. 156/1=156. Not helpful.\n\nWait another idea: 52 divided by something. Let's see 52 divided by 26 is 2, as before. Then 46 divided by that 2 is 23. Then times 1. So that's the same as before. Alternatively, maybe (52 - 26) =26. Then 46 -26 =20. Then 20 + something. But 1 is left. 20 +1=21. Not 23.\n\nAlternatively, 46 - (52 / (26 -1)). Let's compute: 26-1=25. 52/25 is 2.08. Then 46 -2.08 is about 43.92. Not 23.\n\nHmm. Maybe (46 - 26) + (52 / something with 1). 46-26=20. 52 divided by something. If I have 52 divided by (something with 1), like 52/1=52. Then 20 +52=72. Not. Alternatively, 52/(26 -1) =52/25=2.08. Then 20 +2.08=22.08. Close but not exact.\n\nWait, maybe 1 is used as a divisor. For example, 52 / ( (46 -26) /1 ). So 46-26=20. 20/1=20. 52/20=2.6. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 26 - (52 -46)/1. As before, that's 26 -6=20. Not 23.\n\nAlternatively, 52 - (46 - (26 -1)). Let's compute: 26-1=25. 46-25=21. 52-21=31. Not 23.\n\nWait, perhaps (52 - 46) * (26 -1) =6 *25=150. That's way over. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe 26 - (46 / (52 - something)). Let's see. 52 minus what? 52-1=51. 46 divided by 51 is about 0.9. 26 -0.9=25.1. Not 23.\n\nAlternatively, 46 - (26 / (52 - something)). Let's see. 52-1=51. 26/51≈0.509. 46 -0.509≈45.49. Nope.\n\nWait, maybe using 1 in a different way. Let's go back to the first idea: 46 divided by (52 divided by 26) is 23, then multiplied by 1. That uses all numbers. So the equation is (46 / (52 / 26)) * 1 =23. But maybe written differently. The multiplication by 1 is redundant, so maybe just 46 / (52 /26) +1 -1? But that would not use the 1 in a necessary way. Wait, but the problem states that each number can be used once and all must be used. So even if multiplying by 1 seems redundant, it's necessary to include the 1. So the equation would be 46 divided by (52 divided by 26) multiplied by 1. Which can be written as (46 / (52 / 26)) * 1. That works. Let me verify the calculation:\n\n52 divided by 26 is 2. Then 46 divided by 2 is 23. Multiply by 1 is 23. So yes, that's correct. And all numbers are used once. So that's a valid equation. I think that's the solution.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(46 / (52 / 26)) * 1 = 23</answer>"}]}

Maybe division? 73 divided by 53 is about 1.38, which doesn't seem useful.\n\nWait, maybe I should look at the other numbers. The numbers left are 5 and 9. So maybe combine 53 and 73 with 5 and 9. Let's see. Let me think of possible combinations. Since 73 is a prime number, maybe that's tricky. Let's try adding 53 and 73 first. 53 + 73 is 126. Then we have 126, 5, and 9 left. How can we get to 321 from there? 126 times something. 126 * 3 would be 378, which is higher than 321. But 126 * 2.5 is 315. Close. If we can make 2.5 with 5 and 9. Hmm, 9 divided by (something with 5). Wait, 9 divided by (5 - something else). Wait, but we already used 53 and 73. Wait, no, we have to use all four numbers. So adding 53 and 73 uses two numbers, but we still have 5 and 9 left. So perhaps 126 * (something with 5 and 9) plus or minus something else. Wait, but we need to use all four numbers. So if I use 53 and 73 as 53 + 73 = 126, then I have to use 5 and 9. Let's see. Maybe 126 * (9 - 5) = 126 * 4 = 504. That's too big. Alternatively, 126 + (9 * 5) = 126 + 45 = 171. Still too low. 126 - (9 * 5) = 126 -45=81. Nope. Not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, maybe multiply 53 by something. 53*5=265. Then we have 73, 9 left. 265 + 73=338. Then subtract 9: 338-9=329. Close to 321 but not quite. Alternatively, 53*6=318, but how to get 6 from 9 and the other numbers. Wait, 9 - (something). Wait, 53*5=265, then 265 +73=338. Then 338-9=329. Still 8 over. Not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, 73*5=365. Then 365 - 53=312. Then 312 +9=321. Wait, that uses all numbers: 73*5=365, 365-53=312, 312+9=321. So the equation would be (73 * 5) - 53 + 9 = 321. Let's check that: 73*5 is 365. 365 -53 is 312. 312 +9 is 321. Yes! That works. But let me make sure all numbers are used once. 73,5,53,9. Yes, all used. But wait, the order of operations here might need parentheses. Let me see: ((73 * 5) - 53) +9. But according to order of operations, multiplication first, so 73*5 is done first, then subtract 53, then add 9. So the equation is 73*5 -53 +9. But is that acceptable? The problem says to use each number once, and all operations are allowed. Let me check the arithmetic again: 73*5=365. 365-53=312. 312+9=321. Correct. So that's a valid equation. \n\nBut wait, let me see if there's another way, maybe. Let's try different combinations. For example, 53 * (9 -5) = 53*4=212. Then 212 +73=285, which is still lower than 321. 285 + something? But we already used all numbers. No. Hmm. Or 53*9=477. Then 477 -73=404. 404 -5=399. No, that's too high. \n\nAnother approach: 73 -5=68. Then 68 * something. If I have 68 * 53, that's 3604, way too big. Not useful. Or maybe 53 divided by something. 53/5=10.6, not helpful. 9*73=657. Then 657 -53=604. 604/5=120.8. Not 321. Hmm. \n\nAnother idea: 5*9=45. Then 45+73=118. 118* something. 118*2.7... but 2.7 can't be made from 53. Alternatively, 118*53=6254. No. That's way too big. \n\nWait, maybe subtract something. Let's think again. The first solution I had seems to work. Let's confirm again: 73*5=365, 365-53=312, 312+9=321. Yes. So the equation is 73 * 5 -53 +9 = 321. So that's the correct one. Let me see if the problem requires the equation to use parentheses in a certain way. For example, if written as (73 * 5) -53 +9, but technically according to order of operations, the multiplication happens first, so parentheses aren't necessary. But maybe to make it clearer. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects a different grouping.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (73 * (9 -5)) -53. Let's check: 9-5=4. 73*4=292. 292-53=239. Not 321. Nope. \n\nAnother thought: 53 + 73=126. 126 * (9 - (5))=126 *4=504. Too high. \n\nNo, the first solution seems correct. So the equation is 73*5 -53 +9=321. Let me verify once more:\n\n73 multiplied by 5: 73*5=365.\n\n365 minus 53: 365-53=312.\n\n312 plus 9: 312+9=321. \n\nYes, perfect. All numbers used once, operations are allowed. So the equation is correct. So the answer should be in the tags as specified.\n</think>\n\n<answer>73 * 5 - 53 + 9 = 321</answer>"}]}

So maybe I can get 8 from the other numbers. Let's see, the remaining numbers are 28, 14, and 16. Hmm, how can I get 8 from those? Let's see: 28 minus 14 is 14, and 16 divided by something... Wait, maybe 16 divided by (28-14)? That would be 16 /14, which is not 8. Alternatively, maybe 28 divided by 14 is 2, then 16 divided by 2 is 8. Wait, but that uses 28,14, and 16. Then 60 multiplied by that 8 would be 480. Let me check that again. \n\nIf I do 28 divided by 14, that's 2. Then 16 divided by 2 is 8. Then 60 times 8 is 480.

I need to create an equation using the numbers 9, 51, 903, and 75, each exactly once, with basic arithmetic operations to get 786. Hmm, 786 is the target. Let me start by looking at the numbers and see if any combinations stand out.\n\nFirst, the largest number here is 903. Maybe I can use that as a starting point. If I subtract something from 903, maybe I can get close to 786. Let's calculate the difference: 903 - 786 = 117. So if I can get 117 using the other numbers (51, 75, 9), that would work. Let me check if that's possible.\n\nLooking at 51, 75, and 9. Let's see. 75 + 51 is 126. That's too big. 126 minus 9 is 117. Wait, that works! So 75 + 51 = 126, then subtract 9 gives 117. Then 903 - 117 = 786. So putting that together: 903 - (75 + 51 - 9). Wait, but do I need to arrange the operations correctly with parentheses? Let's verify.\n\nWait, 75 + 51 is 126, then 126 - 9 is 117. So 903 - 117 is 786. So the equation would be 903 - (75 + 51 - 9). Let me check that again. 75 +51 = 126, 126 -9=117, 903-117=786. Yes, that works. But wait, do I have to use all the numbers? Let me check: 903, 75, 51, 9. Yes, all are used once. So the equation is 903 - 75 -51 +9. Wait, no, that would be different. Wait, 903 - (75 +51 -9) is the same as 903 -75 -51 +9. Let's compute that:\n\n903 -75 is 828, 828 -51 is 777, plus 9 is 786. Yes, that's correct. So the equation would be 903 - 75 -51 +9 = 786. But the problem says to use all numbers once with each operation. Wait, but in this case, 903, 75, 51, and 9 are all used once. The operations are subtraction, subtraction, and addition. But the problem allows using operations multiple times. So that seems acceptable. Alternatively, maybe write it as 903 - (75 +51) +9. Which would also be the same. But let's check the arithmetic again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way. Let me see. What if I try multiplying some numbers. For example, 51 times 15 is 765, which is close, but 786 -765 is 21. Not sure. Or 75 *10 would be 750, but then adding 36 (from 9*4). Hmm, but maybe that's not helpful.\n\nAnother approach: 903 divided by something. Let's see. 903 divided by 1.15 is roughly 786, but that's not helpful here. Maybe 903 - (something multiplied by something else). Let's see. Let's try combining numbers. For example, 9 and 75. 75 -9 =66. Then 51 multiplied by 66. Wait, 51*66=3366. That's way too big. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 75 divided by 9 is about 8.333. Maybe using that. 51 times 15.333... but that's not an integer. Not helpful.\n\nWait, let's think again. The initial solution seems to work. Let me confirm. 903 -75=828. 828 -51=777. 777 +9=786. Yes, that's correct. So the equation would be 903 -75 -51 +9. But the problem requires using all numbers once and each number exactly once. So in this equation, all numbers are used once. The operations are -, -, +. So that's allowed. So this equation meets the requirements. Alternatively, to write it with parentheses, maybe (903 -75) - (51 -9). Let's check: 903-75=828, 51-9=42, 828-42=786. Yes, that works as well. So that's another way to write the same calculation. This would be (903 -75) - (51 -9) = 786. Let me check: 903-75=828, 51-9=42, 828-42=786. Correct. So this uses all numbers once, with subtraction and parentheses. So that's a valid equation. \n\nAnother possible way: Maybe 903 - (75 +51) +9. Let's see: 75+51=126, 903-126=777, 777+9=786. Yes, same result. So that's another way to write it. But the key is to use all numbers once. So any of these forms would work. The most concise might be (903 -75) - (51 -9) since it groups the operations neatly. So I think that's the equation.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(903 - 75) - (51 - 9) = 786</answer>"}]}

Maybe subtract something from a larger number?\n\nFor example, 68 minus something. Let's see: 68 - 14 = 54. But how to get 14 from the remaining numbers 60, 65, and 2. Hmm. Not sure.

For instance, 68 - 65 = 3. Then use that 3 with 60 and 2. So, 60 - 3*2 = 60 -6=54. Oh! Wait, that uses 68,65,2, and 60. Let me check:\n\n68 - 65 = 3. Then 60 - (3*2) = 60 -6=54. But does that use all numbers? Yes: 68,65,3 is not a number given, but wait, the original numbers are 60,68,65,2. So in this case, 3 is derived from 68-65.

Alright, let's start by thinking about how these numbers can combine.\n\nFirst, 492 is a pretty large number. Let's see what operations can get us there. Multiplication might be necessary because adding or subtracting these numbers might not reach 492. Let's check the possible products.\n\nLooking at the numbers: 97 is close to 100, so maybe 97 multiplied by something. 97 * 5 is 485, which is close to 492 but not quite. Wait, 492 divided by 97 is roughly 5.07, so maybe 97 times 5.07... but how do we get that from the other numbers. Alternatively, maybe 100 multiplied by something. 100 * 5 is 500, which is 8 more than 492. Hmm, but 500 minus 8 is 492. But do I have an 8? No, but I have 82. Wait, 82 is 80 + 2. Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe 100 * 4.92 = 492, but how to get 4.92 from 97, 82, 3. That seems tricky. Let's think differently. Let's consider combining 100 and 3 first. 100 - 3 = 97. But we already have 97 as a separate number, so that might not help. Alternatively, 100 + 3 = 103. Not sure. 100 * 3 is 300, which is half of 600, but we need 492. \n\nWait, 82 is a large number. If I can subtract something from 82*6=492. Wait, 82 * 6 is exactly 492. Oh, that's interesting! So if I can somehow get 6 from the remaining numbers (97, 100, 3). Let's see. How can I get 6 using 97, 100, and 3. Let's think. 100 divided by something? 100 divided by 16.666... is 6, but not helpful. Alternatively, 97 minus 3 is 94. Not 6. 97 plus 3 is 100. But then 100 is already used. Wait, if I do 100 - 97 - 3, that's 0. Not helpful. Hmm. Alternatively, 100 - (97 + 3) = 0. Still no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 97 minus (100 / something). Let's see. 100 divided by 3 is approximately 33.33. 97 minus that is around 63.67, which isn't 6. Hmm. Maybe 100 / (97 - 3) is 100 / 94 ≈1.0638, which isn't 6. So that approach doesn't seem to work.\n\nSo trying to get 6 from 97, 100, 3 isn't straightforward. Maybe another approach. Let's consider other operations. Maybe 97 multiplied by something. 97 * 5 is 485, which is 7 less than 492. If I can get 5 and then add 7. But where would 5 and 7 come from? Not sure. Alternatively, 97 * 5.07... but again, fractions might complicate.\n\nWait, let's try another angle. Let's see if we can combine 100 and 3 in a way that gives a useful number. 100 - 3 = 97, but that uses 100 and 3, leaving 97 and 82. Then 97 * 82 = 7954, which is way over. Not helpful. Alternatively, 82 * (100 - 3) = 82 * 97 = 7954 again. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (82 + 100) * 3 = 182 * 3 = 546. Then subtract 97? 546 - 97 = 449. Not 492. Or (82 * 3) = 246, then 246 + 100 - 97 = 246 + 3 = 249. No. Not helpful.\n\nWait, 100 * 3 is 300. Then 300 + 82 = 382. Then 382 + 97 = 479. Still short. 100*3 +82+97=479. No. \n\nHow about 100* (82 - 3) = 100*79=7900, way too big. \n\nWait, maybe subtract some numbers. 82* (100 - 97) =82*3=246. Then 246* something. But 246*2=492. But how to get 2 from the remaining numbers. Wait, we have 3 left. 3-1=2, but where's the 1? Not there. Alternatively, 3/ something. If we use 3/ (100 -97) =3/3=1. Then 246 * (3/ (100-97))=246*1=246. That doesn't help. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, 82*(100 - (97 -3))=82*(100-94)=82*6=492. Wait, that might work! Let's check. 97 -3 =94. Then 100 -94=6. Then 82*6=492. Yes! So that uses all numbers: 82, 100, 97, 3. Let's verify:\n\n100 - (97 - 3) =100 -94=6. Then 82 *6=492. So the equation would be 82 * (100 - (97 - 3)) =492. Let's check the numbers used: 82,100,97,3. All used once. Operations are subtraction inside the parentheses and multiplication. Perfect. That should be it.\n</think>\n\n<answer>82 * (100 - (97 - 3)) = 492</answer>"}]}

Hmm, let's see. \n\nFirst, maybe I should look at the target number, 194, and see how close I can get with some combinations. Let's list out the numbers: two 66s, 26, and 36. The two 66s might be useful for multiplication or division. Let's try some combinations.\n\nStarting with the largest numbers, 66. If I multiply 66 by something, maybe that can get close. Let's see: 66 * 3 is 198, which is 4 more than 194. But I don't have a 3. Wait, but maybe I can use the other numbers. Let's see.\n\nIf I do 66 * 3, but where can I get a 3 from? The numbers I have are 26, 36, and another 66. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe subtract something from a larger product. For example, 66 * 3 would be 198, and then subtracting 4 gives 194. But again, getting 3 and 4 from the remaining numbers. Not directly possible. Let me think differently.\n\nWhat if I use the two 66s in some way. Let's say 66 + 66 = 132. Then I need 62 more to reach 194. How can I get 62 from 26 and 36? Let's see: 36 + 26 = 62. Oh, that's perfect! So 66 + 66 + 26 + 36 would be 194. Wait, but that's just adding all of them. Let me check:\n\n66 + 66 = 132\n132 + 26 = 158\n158 + 36 = 194. \n\nYes! Wait, but that's just using addition for all numbers. But the problem allows using operations, and requires each number to be used once. Since addition is allowed, and all numbers are used once, that's a valid equation. But wait, let me check the problem statement again. It says \"create an equation that equals 194 using each number only once and all numbers\". So if I can just add them up, that works. But let me verify the sum:\n\n66 + 66 is 132, plus 26 is 158, plus 36 is 194. Yes, that's correct. So the equation would be 66 + 66 + 26 + 36 = 194. But wait, the problem allows using operations one or multiple times. Addition is allowed, so maybe that's the answer. But let me check if that's acceptable. The problem says \"using basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) one or multiple times\". So using addition multiple times is okay. But the example given is (1 + 2) / 3, which uses two numbers with operations. Wait, but in this case, adding all four numbers would require three plus signs. Let me check if the problem allows that. It says \"using basic arithmetic operations... one or multiple times\". So yes, using multiple additions is allowed. So the equation would be 66 + 66 + 26 + 36 = 194, but since each number is used once, and all operations are additions, this should be valid. But wait, the problem might require using at least one of each operation, but the original problem statement doesn't say that. Let me read again: \"You can use basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) one or multiple times but each number can only be used once, and you must use all the numbers.\" So no, it doesn't require using all operations, just that you can use any of them as needed. So in this case, adding all four numbers works. Let me check the sum again: 66 +66=132, +26=158, +36=194. Yes. So that's the equation. But wait, the problem says \"create an equation that equals 194\". So the equation would be 66 + 26 + 36 + 66 = 194. The order doesn't matter because addition is commutative. So this should be correct. \n\nBut maybe the problem expects using a combination of operations, and adding all might seem too straightforward. Let me check if there's another way in case the addition isn't considered valid for some reason. For example, perhaps the problem requires using different operations. Let me explore other possibilities.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using multiplication and subtraction. Let's see. Suppose I take 66 * 3 = 198, then subtract 4. But how to get 3 and 4 from the remaining numbers. Let's see: 36 divided by something. 36 / 12 = 3. But I don't have 12. Alternatively, 26 - (something). Maybe 26 - (something) to get 3. Not obvious. Alternatively, 66 multiplied by 26 is a big number, 1716. Then subtract 36 and the other 66. That's 1716 - 66 -36= 1614. That's way over. Not helpful. \n\nWhat if I divide some numbers. For example, 66 / 36 is about 1.833. Not helpful. 66 divided by 26 is about 2.538. Hmm. Maybe subtract some numbers. For example, 66 * (36 - 26) = 66 *10=660, then subtract the other 66: 660 -66=594. Not close. \n\nAnother approach: Let's try to make 194 as (something multiplied by something else) plus or minus something. Let's see. 26 * 7 is 182. Then add 12 to get 194. How to get 7 and 12 from 66 and 36 and 66. Not sure. Alternatively, 36 *5=180 +14=194. Not helpful. \n\nWait, 194 divided by 66 is approximately 2.939. Not helpful. Maybe 26* something. 26*7=182, as before. Then 194-182=12. So if I can get 12 from 66, 36, and 66. Maybe 66 - (36 + 66) = -36, which isn't helpful. Alternatively, 66/ (something). 66 divided by 5.5 is 12. But where to get 5.5. Maybe (66 - 36)/something. (66-36)=30. 30 divided by 2.5=12. But 2.5 is not available. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe 36 + 26 =62. Then 66*3=198, 198 - 62=136. Not helpful. Wait, perhaps another approach. Let's try 66 multiplied by 3, minus 36 divided by something. Wait, 66*3=198, 198 - (36/9)=198-4=194. But where do I get 9 from? The remaining numbers are 26 and another 66. Not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, 66 + 26 =92. Then 92 *2=184. Then add 10: 194. How to get 2 and 10. 66 and 36 left. 66-36=30. 30 divided by something. Maybe 30 /3=10. But again, 3 from where? Not helpful. \n\nWait another idea: 66 + (26 * something). Let's see. 26*7=182. 66+182=248. That's over. 26*5=130. 66+130=196. Close to 194. Then subtract 2. But where to get 2 from 36 and 66. 66-36=30. Not helpful. 36/18=2, but 18 from where? \n\nAlternatively, 66 - (something) = ... Let's see. 66*3=198. 198 -4=194. How to get 3 and 4 from 26, 36, 66. For example, 36/12=3, but 12 from 66 and 26? 66 - 26=40. Not 12. Alternatively, 26 - (66/ something). 66 divided by 22=3. But 22 from where? 36 - 14=22. But 14 from where. Not helpful. \n\nHmm. This seems tricky. But earlier I thought that simply adding all the numbers gives 194. Let me check again:\n\n66 +66=132, +26=158, +36=194. Yes, that works. So why didn't I think of that first? Maybe the problem expects that, but I thought maybe there's a trick. But according to the problem statement, it's allowed to use only addition. So that should be acceptable. \n\nWait, but let me check the numbers again. The numbers given are 66, 26, 36, 66. So two 66s. But in the problem statement, it says \"using each number only once\". Wait, but there are two 66s. So can I use both 66s? Because they are separate instances. For example, if the numbers were 66, 26, 36, 66, and each can be used once, then using both 66s is allowed because they are separate. So yes, in that case, adding all four numbers is valid. \n\nTherefore, the equation is 66 + 66 + 26 + 36 = 194. But perhaps writing it in a different order to group the 66s first. So (66 + 66) + (26 + 36) = 194. Or any order. As long as all numbers are used once and the result is 194. \n\nBut let me confirm once more. 66 +66 is 132. 26 +36 is 62. 132 +62 is 194. Yes. So the equation is correct. Therefore, that's the answer.\n</think>\n\n<answer>66 + 66 + 26 + 36 = 194</answer>"}]}

Let's start by thinking about how these numbers can combine.\n\nFirst, I notice that 63 and 44 are somewhat close to each other. Maybe subtracting them? 63 - 44 is 19. Then I have 61 and 56 left. 61 + 56 is 117. 117 plus 19 is 136, which is way over. Not helpful. Maybe subtract? 117 - 19 is 98. Still not 102. Close, though. Maybe that's a direction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe multiply some numbers. Let's see. If I take 63 and subtract 56, that's 7. Then 44 divided by something? 44 divided by... Hmm, not sure. Wait, 44 divided by (something) to get a number that when multiplied by 7 gives part of 102. Let me try. 63 - 56 = 7. Then 44 divided by something. Wait, maybe 44 divided by (61 - 63 +56?), no, that's complicating. Maybe another approach.\n\nWhat if I try to combine 61 and 56 first? 61 + 56 is 117. Then maybe subtract something. If I subtract 63 -44, which is 19, then 117 -19 is 98. Still not 102. Alternatively, 117 - (63 +44) would be 117 -107=10. Not helpful. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe multiply 61 by something. 61 is a prime number, so maybe not the best. Let's see. 63 divided by something. 63 divided by 56 is a fraction. Maybe 63 divided by (56/44). Let's calculate 56 divided by 44 is 1.272..., then 63 divided by that is around 49.5. Then 61 minus that would be 11.5. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe 63 divided by something else. Let's think. Let's try to get a larger number. 56 multiplied by 44 is 2464. That's way too big. Maybe 56 +44=100. Then 100 plus 61 is 161. Then subtract 63? 161-63=98. Again, close but not 102.\n\nWait, 56 +44=100. Then 100 + (63-61)=100+2=102. Oh! Wait, that uses 56,44,63,61. Let's check: 56 +44 = 100. Then 63-61=2. Adding those together: 100+2=102. Yes! But how to write the equation using all numbers once. Let me check:\n\nSo 56 +44 =100, and 63-61=2. Then 100 +2=102. So the equation would be (56 +44) + (63 -61) =102. But does that use all numbers? 56,44,63,61. Yes, all four. So the equation is (56 + 44) + (63 - 61) = 102. Let me verify:\n\n56 +44 is 100. 63-61 is 2. 100 +2 is 102. Yes, that works. So that's the equation. I think that's the solution. Let me just make sure there's no other way, but this seems straightforward.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(56 + 44) + (63 - 61) = 102</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using the numbers 11, 1, 8, and 334, each exactly once, with basic arithmetic operations, to get 422. Hmm. Let's start by thinking about how these numbers can combine. \n\nFirst, 334 is a pretty big number. Maybe I can use that as a base. 422 is larger than 334, so maybe I need to add something to 334. Let's check: 422 minus 334 is 88. So if I can get 88 from 11, 1, and 8, that would work. But how?\n\nLooking at 11, 8, and 1. Let's see. 11 times 8 is 88. Oh, wait! 11 * 8 is 88. Then adding 1 would make it 89, which is too much. Wait, but if I can do 11 * 8 and then subtract 1, that's 88 -1 =87. Not 88. Hmm. Wait, 11*8 is 88 exactly. But then I have to use 1 as well. But if I do 11*8 + 1, that's 89, which is 1 more than needed. But maybe there's another way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe multiply 11 by (8 + 1). That's 11*9=99. Then 334 + 99 is 433. Not enough. Hmm. Or maybe subtract. 334 - 99 = 235. Not helpful.\n\nWait, the target is 422. Let's see another approach. Maybe subtract something from 334 to get part of 422. 334 is 334. If I subtract something to get to 422, that doesn't make sense because 334 is smaller. Wait, no. To reach 422, I need to add to 334. So 422 - 334 = 88. So I need to get 88 using 11, 8, and 1. Wait, 11*8=88. So if I can do 334 + (11*8) + 1? Wait, but that uses 334, 11, 8, and 1. But then the equation would be 334 + 11*8 + 1. But that's 334 + 88 +1= 423. Oh, that's one over. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe there's another way. What if I do 11*(8+1) = 99, then 334 + 99 = 433. That's not helpful. Or 334 - 99 = 235. No.\n\nAlternatively, maybe multiply 334 by something. But 334 is already a big number. 334*1 is 334, but adding 11 and 8 would be 334+11+8=353. Not enough. 334* (11 -8 -1) is 334*2=668. That's too much. \n\nWait, let's think differently. Maybe use division. For example, 334 + (11 * (8 / 1)). Let's calculate: 8/1 is 8, then 11*8=88, plus 334 is 422. Oh! Wait, that works. So 334 + 11 * (8 / 1) = 334 + 88 = 422. And all numbers are used once: 334, 11, 8, 1. The division here is 8 divided by 1, which is just 8, but that's allowed. So the equation would be 334 + 11 * (8 / 1) = 422. But since we need to write it using each number once, and all operations, that's valid. Let me check again: 8 divided by 1 is 8, multiplied by 11 is 88, added to 334 gives 422. Yes. That works. So the equation is 334 + 11 * (8 / 1) = 422. \n\nAlternatively, maybe parentheses can be arranged differently, but that seems correct. Let me verify:\n\n334 + (11 * (8 / 1)) = 334 + (11 * 8) = 334 +88=422. Correct. And all numbers are used once. So that's the solution. Wait, but sometimes the order might matter. Let me check if there's another way. For example, maybe 8 divided by 1 is 8, then multiplied by 11 gives 88. Then 334 +88 = 422. Exactly.

I need to use the numbers 66, 27, 57, and 62 each exactly once, with basic arithmetic operations to make 88. Hmm. Let's start by thinking about how these numbers can combine. \n\nFirst, maybe look for pairs that can add up or subtract to get closer to 88. Let's check some possibilities. If I add 66 and 27, that's 93, which is higher than 88. If I subtract 27 from 66, that's 39. Not sure. What about 57 and 62? 57 + 62 is 119. That's way over. 62 - 57 is 5. Maybe that's too small. \n\nAlternatively, maybe multiply some numbers. 66 multiplied by something. If I take 66 and multiply by 1, that's still 66. Wait, but I need to use all numbers. So maybe 66 plus something. Let's see: 66 + (some combination of 27,57,62). Let's see. 27 +57 is 84, so 66 + (27 +57) would be 66 +84=150. That's too big. Maybe 66 + (62 -27). Let's compute 62-27=35, then 66+35=101. Still not 88. \n\nWhat if I subtract instead? 66 - (something). For example, 66 - (62 -27). Let's see: 62-27=35, so 66-35=31. Not helpful. How about 57 -27=30. Then 66 -30=36. No.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe divide some numbers. Let's see if dividing any of these can give a useful number. For example, 57 divided by something. 57/3 is 19, but I don't have a 3. Wait, 27 divided by something. 27 divided by 3 is 9, but again, maybe not. Let's think about 66 divided by something. 66/6 would be 11, but I don't have a 6. \n\nWait, maybe combine operations. For example, 66 - (something) =88. But 66 is less than 88, so that would require the \"something\" to be negative. Let's see: 66 - (x) =88 → x= -22. So I need to create -22 using 27,57,62. Hmm. How? Let's see: 27 - 57= -30, then -30 combined with 62. So 27 -57 +62= 27 +62=89 -57=32? Wait, no. Wait, 27 -57 is -30, then -30 +62=32. So 66 -32=34. Not 88. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (62 - (57 +27)) = 62 -84= -22. Then 66 - (-22) =66 +22=88. Oh! Wait, that works. Let me check:\n\nSo, 62 minus (57 plus 27) equals 62 -84= -22. Then 66 minus that negative would be 66 +22=88. So the equation would be 66 - (62 - (57 +27)) =88. But wait, let's check parentheses. Let me parse this step by step.\n\nFirst, compute 57 +27=84. Then subtract that from 62: 62 -84= -22. Then subtract that result from 66: 66 - (-22) =66 +22=88. So yes, that works. Let me write that as an equation: 66 - (62 - (57 +27)) =88. Let's verify:\n\n57 +27=84\n\n62 -84= -22\n\n66 - (-22) =88. Correct. So the equation is 66 - (62 - 57 -27) =88, but wait, 57+27 is in parentheses. Alternatively, 66 - (62 - (57 +27))=88. \n\nBut I need to use each number once. Let me check if all numbers are used: 66,62,57,27. Yes. Each is used once. Operations used are subtraction and addition. So that's a valid equation. Let me check if there's another way, but this seems to work. \n\nAlternatively, maybe other arrangements. For example, can I multiply? Let's see: 27 and 57. 27*57 is way too big. 66/27 is roughly 2.44. Not helpful. 62/27 is about 2.3. Hmm. Maybe 57 -27=30. Then 62 +30=92. 92 - something=88. 92-4=88. So where do I get 4? 66 divided by something. 66/ (something) =4. That would require 66/16.5=4, but I don't have 16.5. Alternatively, 66 - (something)=4. That would require something=62. But 62 is already used. So maybe that path doesn't work.\n\nAnother thought: 66 + something. 88-66=22. So I need to make 22 with 27,57,62. How? 27 - (62-57). Let's see: 62-57=5. 27-5=22. So that would be 66 + (27 - (62 -57))=88. Let's check:\n\n62-57=5, 27-5=22, 66+22=88. Yes! So that's another way. Let's see: 66 +27 - (62 -57). But parentheses are needed for order. So the equation would be 66 + (27 - (62 -57)) =88. Let's check the numbers: 66,27,62,57. All used once. So that's valid. \n\nSo two possible equations here. The first one was 66 - (62 -57 -27) =88, but actually, the way the parentheses work, the first equation is 66 - (62 - (57 +27))=88. But the second equation is 66 + (27 - (62 -57))=88. Both are valid and use all numbers once. \n\nWait, but maybe there are even more possibilities. Let's check another approach. For example, 62 multiplied by something. 62*1=62. 62* (something) =88. 88/62≈1.419. Not sure. Alternatively, 57* something. 57*1.54≈88. Not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, subtract two numbers. Let's see: 66 - 27=39. Then 39 combined with 57 and 62. 39 +57=96, then 96 -62=34. No. Not helpful. \n\nWait another angle: 57 +62=119. Then 119 - something=88. That something would be 31. So 119 -31=88. How to get 31 from 66 and 27. 66-27=39. 39 is not 31. 27+ (something)=31, which would be 4. Not possible with 66. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, 62 -57=5. Then 5 combined with others. 66 -5=61. Then 61 +27=88. Yes! So that would be 66 - (62 -57) +27=88. Let's check:\n\n62-57=5, 66-5=61, 61+27=88. Correct. So the equation is (66 - (62 -57)) +27=88. But let's check the order of operations. Since subtraction and addition are left to right, but the parentheses clarify. So 66 - (62-57) is 66-5=61, then 61+27=88. Yes. So this is another valid equation: 66 - (62 -57) +27 =88. \n\nBut wait, does that use all numbers? Let's check: 66,62,57,27. Yes. Each used once. Operations: subtract and add. So that's a third way. \n\nSo there are multiple equations possible. For example:\n\n1. 66 - (62 - (57 +27)) =88\n2. 66 + (27 - (62 -57)) =88\n3. 66 - (62 -57) +27 =88\n\nAll of these are valid. The third one might be the simplest in terms of parentheses. Let me verify:\n\nFor the third equation: 62-57=5. Then 66-5=61. 61+27=88. Correct. So writing it as 66 - (62 -57) +27 =88. Since the subtraction and addition are left to right, but the parentheses make it clear. So it's (66 - (62 -57)) +27. But in the written equation, if you just write 66 - (62 -57) +27, the parentheses ensure that the 62-57 is done first, then subtracted from 66, then add 27. Which works.\n\nSo the answer could be any of these forms. Let's pick the third one as it's perhaps the simplest. So putting it into the required format.\n</think>\n\n<answer>66 - (62 - 57) + 27 = 88</answer>"}]}

So maybe if I can get 6 from the other numbers, then 54*6 would work. Let's check the remaining numbers: 44, 33, 8. How can I get 6 from those? Let's see. 44 minus 33 is 11. Then 11 minus 8 is 3. That's not 6. Alternatively, 33 divided by something? 33 divided by (44 - 8) would be 33/36 which is 0.916, not helpful. Maybe 44 - (33 - 8) = 44 -25=19. Not 6.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 33 - (44 / 8). Let's calculate that: 44 divided by 8 is 5.5. 33 -5.5=27.5. Still not 6. Hmm. Maybe that approach isn't working. Let's think differently.\n\nWhat if I combine 44 and 33 first. Let's see, 44 +33=77. Then 77 * something with 8 and 54. But 77*4=308, which is close to 324 but not there. 77*4.2 is like 324, but we need integers. Maybe subtract instead: 44*33 is 1452. That's way too big. Divided by something? 1452 /54 is about 26.888, not helpful. Divided by 8? 1452/8=181.5. Still no.\n\nAnother angle: 54 is part of the equation, maybe multiplied by something else. 54*6=324. How to get 6? Let's see. The remaining numbers are 44, 33, 8. Let's try (44 - 33) -8. 44-33=11, 11-8=3. Not 6. How about (44 - 8) divided by something? 44-8=36. 36 divided by 6=6. Wait, but I don't have a 6. Wait, 44-8 is 36. Then 36 divided by (something with 33). If I do 36 divided by (33/ something). Let's see. 33 divided by 5.5 is 6, but 5.5 comes from 44/8=5.5. Wait! So maybe 33 divided by (44/8). Let's compute that: 44 divided by 8 is 5.5. Then 33 divided by 5.5 is 6. Yes! So then 54 multiplied by that 6 would be 324. Let me check:\n\n54 * (33 / (44 / 8)) = 54 * (33 /5.5) =54 *6=324. That works! So the equation is 54 * (33 / (44 / 8)). Let's make sure all numbers are used once: 54, 33, 44, 8. Yes, all used. The operations are division inside the parentheses, then division outside, then multiplication. So that should be the equation.\n</think>\n\n<answer>54 * (33 / (44 / 8))</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using the numbers 34, 35, 5, and 56 exactly once each, and the result should be 272. Hmm. Let's start by thinking about possible operations that can get us close to 272. \n\nFirst, maybe multiplication could help because 272 is a relatively large number. Let's check the largest numbers here: 56 and 35. If I multiply them, 56 * 35 is 1960, which is way too big. That's way over. So maybe that's not the right path.\n\nWhat if I use division to reduce a larger number? For example, 56 divided by something. If I do 56 / 5, that's 11.2. Then maybe multiply by 34 or 35? Let's try 56/5=11.2, then 11.2*34=380.8. Hmm, that's 380.8, which is over 272. If I subtract 35 from that, 380.8 -35 = 345.8, which is still over. Alternatively, maybe 35 - (56/5) = 35 - 11.2 = 23.8. Then multiply by 34? 23.8*34=809.2. That's way too high. Hmm, not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe 35 * 5 is 175. Then 175 + 34 = 209. Then 209 + 56 = 265. Close to 272 but still 7 short. Not enough. Alternatively, if I do 35*5=175, then 175 +56=231, then 231+34=265. Same result. Not helpful.\n\nWhat if I subtract some numbers? Let's see. 56*5=280. Then 280 minus something. 280 - 34 = 246. Then 246 +35=281. That's 281, which is 9 over. Not quite. Alternatively, 56*5=280, then subtract 35=245. Then 245 +34=279. Still 7 over. Hmm.\n\nWait, 34*8 is 272. Oh, maybe 8 can be formed from the remaining numbers. Let's see. How to get 8 from 35,5,56. 35 - (56/5) = 35 -11.2=23.8. Not 8. Or 56/(35-5)=56/30≈1.866, no. Hmm. Maybe 5 + (35/ something). Like 35/5=7, then 7 + something. 35 divided by 5 is 7. Then 7 + something equals 8. But that would need 1, which isn't available. Alternatively, 56 divided by 7 is 8. Wait, 35/5 is 7, then 56/7=8. So then 34*8=272. So putting it all together: 34 * (56 / (35 /5)). Let's check that. 35 divided by 5 is 7, then 56 divided by 7 is 8, and 34 times 8 is 272. Yes! That works. Let's verify each step: 35/5=7, 56/7=8, 34*8=272. All numbers used once. So the equation is 34 * (56 / (35 / 5)) = 272. That should do it.\n</think>\n\n<answer>34 * (56 / (35 / 5))</answer>"}]}

The operations allowed are +, -, *, /, and I can use them multiple times. Hmm. Let's start by thinking about what combinations could get me close to 108. \n\nFirst, maybe combining the larger numbers first. 82 and 26 are the big ones. Let's see, 82 + 26 is 108, but wait, that would be 108 already. But then I still have the two 2s left. Oh, but I need to use all the numbers. So if I just do 82 +26, that uses two numbers, but I have to use all four. So that's not going to work.\n\nWait, maybe I can use the 2s in some way. Like, subtracting or adding them. Let me think. If I subtract the two 2s from 82 and 26, but not sure. Let's see: 82 + 26 = 108, but I need to incorporate the 2s. So maybe 82 + (26 * (2 / 2)). Because 2/2 is 1, so 26*1 is 26, and 82+26 is 108. That uses all numbers: 82, 26, 2, 2. Let me check: 2 divided by 2 is 1, multiplied by 26 gives 26, then add 82 gives 108. Yes, that works. But wait, does the order of operations matter here? Let me write that out properly. The equation would be 82 + (26 * (2 / 2)) = 82 + (26 *1) = 82 +26 =108. Yes, that's correct. So all numbers are used once. That should be the answer. \n\nAlternatively, maybe another way. Let's think if there's another combination. For example, 82 - 26 is 56. Then using the 2s: 56 * (2 +2) = 56*4=224, which is way over. Not helpful. What if we do 82 * (26 - (2+2))? 26 -4=22, 82*22=1804, way too big. Not good. \n\nAnother approach: 26 * something. 26 * 4 is 104, which is close to 108. But how to get 4 from the remaining numbers. We have 82, 2, 2. Wait, but 82 can be used with 2s. Let's see: 26 * (2 + 2) = 26 *4=104. Then add 82? But that would be 104 +82=186, which uses all numbers but the total is way over. If instead subtract 82: 104 -82=22. Not helpful. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, 82 divided by 2 is 41. Then 41 * 2 is 82 again. Not sure. Let me think. If I do 82 / 2 =41, then 26 +41=67, then 67 *2=134. No. Not helpful.\n\nWait, what if I subtract 26 from 82: 82 -26=56. Then 56 * (2/2)=56*1=56. But that's too low. Not useful. \n\nAlternatively, maybe (82 - 2) * (2 + something). Let's see: 82-2=80. Then 2 +26=28. 80*28=2240. Nope. Way too big. \n\nAnother angle: Maybe using division with the 2s. Since we have two 2s, dividing them gives 1, which can be a neutral element. So 26*1=26, then 82+26=108. That's the first idea I had. So the equation would be 82 + (26 * (2 / 2)) = 108. That uses all numbers once and gives the correct result. \n\nLet me check again. 2 divided by 2 is 1. Multiply by 26 gives 26. Then 82 +26 is 108. Yep, that works. So that's the equation. I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\n<answer>82 + (26 * (2 / 2))</answer>"}]}

Let's start by thinking about the operations I can use: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division. \n\nFirst, 810 is a large number, so maybe multiplication is involved. Let me see the numbers. The largest number here is 749. If I can somehow multiply 749 by something to get close to 810. But 749 times 1 is 749, which is already under 810. If I subtract something from 749, but that might not help. Alternatively, maybe adding 749 and another number. 749 + 84 is 833, which is 23 more than 810. Hmm. Maybe I need to adjust that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe combine some numbers first. Let's see. 84 and 35: 84 + 35 = 119. 119 plus 58 is 177. 177 plus 749 is 926. That's way over. But maybe subtract. 749 - 84 = 665. Then 665 + 35 = 700. 700 +58=758. Still not enough. \n\nWait, maybe multiply some numbers. Let's see. If I multiply 84 by 35, that's 2940. That's way too big. 84 times 58 is 4872. Even bigger. 35 times 58 is 2030. Still too big. Maybe divide. 749 divided by something. 749 /35 is about 21.4. Not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, 84 * 58 = 4872. If I subtract something from that. 4872 - 749 = 4123. Still way over. Not helpful. \n\nWait, maybe 749 minus something multiplied by something. Let me think. Suppose I take 749 and subtract 84, which is 665. Then multiply by something. 665 * 1.2 is around 800, but how to get 1.2 from 35 and 58. Maybe 35 divided by 58 is about 0.6. Not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, 84 + 58 = 142. 142 * 5.7 ≈ 810. But 5.7 isn't directly obtainable from 35 and 749. Hmm. Maybe 35 divided by something. 35/ (749 - 58) = 35/691 ≈ 0.05. Not useful. \n\nWait, let's try a different approach. The target is 810. Let's see if 810 can be broken down into parts. 810 is 810 = 800 +10. How can I get 800 from these numbers? 84 + 35 +58=177, which is not enough. 749 is a big number. Maybe 749 + (84 - 35) = 749 +49=798. Then 798 +58=856. That's 46 over. Not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, 749 -58=691. Then 691 +84=775. 775 +35=810. Wait, that's exactly 810! Let me check:\n\n749 -58 = 691\n\n691 +84 = 775\n\n775 +35 = 810\n\nBut wait, does that use all numbers? 749, 58, 84, 35. Yes, all four numbers. So the equation would be 749 - 58 + 84 +35 =810. Let me verify:\n\n749 -58 is 691. 691 +84 is 775. 775 +35 is 810. Yes! That works. But wait, the problem says to use each number once and all the numbers. So in this case, the equation is (749 -58) +84 +35 =810. But since subtraction and addition can be ordered left to right, maybe written as 749 -58 +84 +35. Let me check the arithmetic again step by step:\n\n749 -58 = 691\n\n691 +84 = 775\n\n775 +35 = 810. Correct. So yes, this equation uses all four numbers once with operations: subtraction and addition. So the equation is 749 - 58 + 84 + 35 =810. \n\nI think that works. Let me see if there's another way, but this seems straightforward. Alternatively, could there be another combination? Let me check. For example, maybe multiplication. Suppose 84 * 35 = 2940. 2940 / something. 2940 /3.63 ≈810. But how to get 3.63 from 58 and 749. Not likely. \n\nAlternatively, 749 - (58 * (35 - 84)). Wait, 35 -84 is negative. 58 * (-49) = -2842. 749 - (-2842)=3591. Way too big. Not helpful. \n\nAnother idea: 84 * (58 -35) =84 *23= 1932. 1932 -749=1183. Still not 810. \n\nHmm. Let me check the first solution again. 749 -58+84+35. Yes, that's correct. All numbers used once. So that's the equation.\n</think>\n\n<answer>749 - 58 + 84 + 35 = 810</answer>"}]}

Let's start by thinking about the bigger numbers here. The largest is 162, then 74, 73, and 62. \n\nFirst, maybe I can multiply some of these. Let's see, 162 multiplied by something. If I take 162 * 2, that's 324, which is still less than 371. But how can I get a 2? Maybe using 74 and 73? 74 - 73 is 1, but that's not helpful. Wait, 73 minus 62 is 11, but not sure.

Let's see. 73 - 62 =11, 162 / 11 isn't an integer. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe 162 divided by something. 162 divided by 62 is about 2.61... Not helpful. \n\nWait, if 74*5 is 370, maybe 74*5 +1.

Then 89*4=356, which is close but not 371. Hmm. Then adding 74 and 62: 356 +74=430, plus 62=492, which is way over. \n\nWait, maybe combine 73 and 62. 73+62=135. Then 162 +74=236. 236 +135=371? Wait, 162+74=236? Let's check: 162+74=236. Then 73+62=135. 236+135=371. Wait, that actually works? Let me add them again. 162 +74=236. 73 +62=135. 236 +135=371. But hold on, I used all the numbers: 162,74,73,62. Each once. And the operations are additions. So the equation would be (162 +74) + (73 +62)=371. Is that correct?

For example, 93 is the largest number here. If I subtract something from 93, maybe that could help. Let's see: 93 minus 47 is 46. That's not enough. 93 minus 84 is 9. Not helpful. What about 84 minus 47? That's 37. Still not 58. \n\nAlternatively, maybe addition. 47 + 5 = 52. Then we have 84 and 93 left. If we subtract 84 from 93, that's 9. Then 52 + 9 = 61. Not 58. Or 52 - 9 = 43. Hmm. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe multiplication or division. Let's see. 84 divided by something. 84 divided by 5 is 16.8, which might not be helpful. 93 divided by 47 is approximately 1.978. Not sure. Maybe 47 divided by 5 is 9.4. Still not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, combine operations. Let's try to get 58 from 93 - something. If 93 - 35 = 58. How can I get 35 from 5, 47, 84. Hmm. 47 - (84/5). Wait, 84 divided by 5 is 16.8. 47 - 16.8 is 30.2. 93 - 30.2 is 62.8. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe 84 - 47 = 37. Then 37 + 5 = 42. 93 - 42 = 51. No. Not 58. \n\nWhat if I use division in a way that gives me a fraction to adjust the numbers. For example, 93 - (84 / (47 -5)). Let's compute that. 47-5=42. Then 84 divided by 42 is 2. So 93 - 2 =91. Not 58.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (47 - 5) * (93 - 84). 47-5=42. 93-84=9. 42*9=378. Way off. \n\nWait, what if I do 84 - (93 - 47) /5. Let's check. 93-47=46. 46 divided by 5 is 9.2. 84 -9.2=74.8. Not 58.\n\nOr maybe (93 - 47) + (84 /5). 93-47=46. 84/5=16.8. 46+16.8=62.8. Still not.\n\nHmm, maybe another approach. Let's think about the target 58. Let's see, 5 and 47 can be used in some way. 47 +5=52. If I can add 6 to that, I get 58. Where to get 6 from? Using 84 and 93. 93-84=9. Then 52 +9=61. Not helpful. But 9- something. Wait, 9 - (something). But I already used 5,47,84,93. Wait, need to use all numbers.\n\nWait, maybe 47 + (84 / (93 -5)). Let's compute denominator: 93-5=88. 84 divided by 88 is 0.9545... 47 +0.9545≈47.95. Not 58.\n\nAlternatively, 93 - (47 + 5) = 93 -52=41. Then 84 -41=43. Not 58.\n\nHmm, maybe multiplication. Let's try 47 *5=235. Then 93 +84=177. 235 -177=58. Wait, that's 47*5 - (93 +84) = 235 - 177=58. Does that work? Let's check. Numbers used: 47,5,93,84. All used once. Yes! So the equation would be 47*5 -93 -84 = 58. Wait, but 47*5 is 235, then subtract 93 and 84: 235 -93=142, 142-84=58. So yes, that works. So the equation is 47×5 -93 -84 =58. Let me verify:\n\n47 × 5 = 235\n\n235 - 93 = 142\n\n142 - 84 = 58\n\nYes! That's correct. All numbers used once, operations are multiplication and subtraction. So the equation is (47*5) -93 -84 =58.

Maybe that's not the way.\n\nWait, what if I use 73 multiplied by something else. Let's see. 73 * 12 would be 876, which is close to 872. But how do I get 12 from the remaining numbers? The remaining numbers are 55, 19, and 8. Let's see: 55 - 19 - 8 = 28, which is not 12. Or 19 - 8 = 11, then 55 / (19 -8) = 5. Hmm. Not helpful. Maybe (55 -19) divided by something? 55-19=36. 36 divided by 8 is 4.5. Then 73 *4.5 is 328.5, which is way off.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 73 + 55 = 128. Then 128 * 8 is 1024. Then 1024 - 19 is 1005. Still not 872. Hmm.\n\nWait, 872 divided by 73 is approximately 11.945. So 73 * something around 12. Let me check 73*12=876. So if I can get 12 from the remaining numbers (55,19,8), maybe subtract something. 55 - 19 -8 =28, but that's too much. Alternatively, (55 - (19 +8))=55-27=28. Still 28. Not helpful. How else?\n\nAlternatively, maybe 55 / 5 =11. But where do I get 5? 19 - 14=5? But 14 from where? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, 19 -8=11. Then 55 /11=5. Then 73 *5=365. That's way too low. Not helpful.\n\nAnother angle: Let's see 8*55=440. Then 440*2=880. Close to 872. But how to get the 2 from remaining numbers. 73-19=54. 54/27=2. But that's using extra numbers. Not allowed. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe (73 -19) =54. Then 54 *8=432. Then 432 +55=487. Nope. Not helpful.\n\nWait, 55*19=1045. Then 1045-73=972. 972 - (8* something). 972 -100=872. So 100=8*12.5. But 12.5 is not possible with remaining numbers. Alternatively, 972 - (8 *12.5)=972-100=872. But I don't have 12.5. Maybe 55 and 19 used already. So that's not possible.\n\nAnother approach: 73* (8+ something). Let's say 73*(8 + x) =872. Then 8 +x= 872/73=11.945. So x≈3.945. How to get that from 55 and 19. 55-19=36. 36 divided by something. 36/9=4, but 9 from where? Not possible. Maybe 55/(19-8)=55/11=5. Then 8 +5=13. 73*13=949. Not 872. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, 55-19=36. 36/8=4.5. Then 73*4.5=328.5. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe subtract two products. Let's see. 73*8=584. 55*19=1045. Then 1045-584=461. No. Not 872. Alternatively, 73*19=1387. 55*8=440. 1387-440=947. Still not.\n\nHmm, maybe 73* (55 - (19 +8)). Let's calculate that. 19+8=27. 55-27=28. 73*28=2044. No, way too high.\n\nAlternatively, 73*(55-19)/8. Let's see, 55-19=36. 73*36=2628. 2628/8=328.5. No.\n\nWait, what if I do 55*19=1045. Then 1045 -73=972. Then 972 - 8* something=872. 972 - 872=100. So 8*12.5=100. But 12.5? How to get that. Maybe (55+19)/8=74/8=9.25. 73*9.25=675.25. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (73 +55) *8 = (128)*8=1024. Then 1024 -19=1005. Not 872.\n\nWait, maybe (73 -19) =54. Then 54*(55-8)=54*47=2538. That's way too big.\n\nAnother idea: 872 divided by 8 is 109. So if I can get 109 from 73,55,19. Let's see: 73 +55=128. 128-19=109. Oh! So 109 *8=872. So putting that together: (73 +55 -19) *8. Let's check:\n\n73+55=128. 128-19=109. 109*8=872. Yes! That works. Let me verify all numbers are used once: 73,55,19,8. Yes, all used once. Operations used: +, -, *.\n\nSo the equation is (73 +55 -19) *8 =872. So the answer would be (73 + 55 - 19) * 8.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(73 + 55 - 19) * 8</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using the numbers 29, 51, 5, and 13, each exactly once, with basic operations, to get 87. Hmm. Let's start by thinking about the target number, 87. What's 87 in relation to these numbers?\n\nFirst, maybe I can break down 87 into parts. Let's see, 87 divided by 3 is 29. Oh, wait, 29 is one of the numbers. So maybe 29 multiplied by 3 equals 87. But how do I get 3 from the remaining numbers 51, 5, and 13? Let's see. 51 divided by something? 51 divided by 17 is 3. Wait, do I have 17? No. But 13 and 5 can make 18 or 8. Not sure. Alternatively, 51 - (13 +5) is 51-18=33. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 51 divided by (13 - 5). Let's compute that. 13 -5 is 8. 51 divided by 8 is 6.375. Hmm, not 3. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe 51 - (5 * something). 5* something. Let's see, 51 - (5* something). If I do 51 - 5* something. Let's think, 5 multiplied by 7.8 is 39, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe 5 and 13 can be used with 51. Let's see.\n\nAnother approach: 87 is 51 + 36. Do I have 36? Well, 29 + 5 + 13 = 47. No. 29 +5 is 34, plus 13 is 47. Not 36. Alternatively, 29 * something. 29*3 is 87, but again, how to get 3. Wait, 51 divided by 17 is 3. How to get 17 from 5 and 13? 13 +5 is 18, 13 -5 is 8. No. 13*5 is 65. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe subtract. 51 - (13 +5) = 51-18=33. Then 29 +33=62, which is not 87. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe multiplication. Let's see, 51 is a big number. If I multiply 51 by something. 51*2=102, which is over. Hmm. Maybe 51 + 29=80. Then 80 plus 7=87. But how to get 7 from 5 and 13? 13-5=8, which is close. 8 minus 1 is 7, but where's the 1? Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 51 + (29 - something). Let's try. 29 - (13 -5)=29-8=21. Then 51+21=72. No. Not 87.\n\nWait, maybe 5*(13 + something). 5*(13+ x). Let's see. If I use 5*17=85, which is 85, close to 87. Then add 2. But how? 17 would need to come from 13 +4, but I don't have 4. Alternatively, 13 +5=18. 5*18=90. Then subtract 3. But I don't have a 3. Unless 51 divided by 17. But again, how to get 17.\n\nAlternatively, 29 + 51=80. Then need 7 more. From 13 and 5. 13 -5=8. So 80+8=88. Close. But that's 88. Hmm. 88 is one more than 87. Maybe subtract 1. But how?\n\nWait, what if 29 + (51 - (13 -5))? Let's calculate: 13-5=8. 51-8=43. Then 29+43=72. Not 87.\n\nHmm. Maybe another approach. Let's list all possible combinations. Since we have four numbers, maybe two operations. Let's think of possible pairs.\n\n29 and 51: 29+51=80, 51-29=22, 29*51=1479 (too big), 51/29≈1.76.\n\nThen 5 and 13: 5+13=18, 13-5=8, 5*13=65, 13/5=2.6.\n\nSo maybe combining these. For example, 80 (from 29+51) plus 65 (5*13)=145. No. 80 +18=98. 80 -18=62. 80*18=1440. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 22 (51-29) + 65 (5*13)=87. Wait, 22+65=87. Wait that's possible. Let me check. 51-29=22. 5*13=65. Then 22+65=87. But that uses all four numbers: 51,29,5,13. So the equation would be (51 -29) + (5 *13) =87. Let me check:\n\n51-29=22. 5*13=65. 22+65=87. Yes! That works. All numbers used once. Operations are -, *, +. So the equation is (51 -29) + (5 *13) =87.\n\nWait, but does that use each number exactly once? Let's see: 51,29,5,13. Yes, each is used once. So that's the solution.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(51 - 29) + (5 * 13) = 87</answer>"}]}

Like 93 minus 77 is 16. Then 42 divided by 1 is 42. But 16 + 42 is 58. Wait, but I have to use all the numbers. Wait, 93 - 77 = 16, then 42 / 1 is 42. 16 + 42 equals 58.

Let me verify that. 93 minus 77 is 16. 42 divided by 1 is 42. 16 plus 42 is indeed 58. And all numbers are used once: 93, 77, 42, 1. Yep, that works. So maybe that's the answer. Let me see if there's another way, but this seems straightforward. Alternatively, could I use multiplication? Like 77 - (93 - 42) /1. Wait, 93-42 is 51, divided by 1 is 51, 77-51 is 26. No, not 58. How about 77 + 42 = 119, then 93 - 1 = 92. 119 - 92 is 27. Not helpful. Alternatively, 93 - (77 + 42) /1. 77+42 is 119, 93-119 is -26. Nope. Hmm. What if I divide 42 by something.

All numbers must be used once, and I can only use basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Hmm.\n\nFirst, maybe I should list out all the numbers and think about possible combinations. The target is 44, which is a relatively small number compared to some of the numbers here, like 865 and 87. That might mean I need to use division or subtraction to reduce those larger numbers.\n\nLet me start by considering the largest number, 865. If I can somehow divide or subtract this to get a smaller number that can contribute to 44. For example, 865 divided by something. Let's see, 865 divided by 19 is about 45.5, which is close to 44. But do I have a 19? The numbers I have are 87, 74, 16. Wait, 74 minus 16 is 58, which is not 19. Alternatively, 87 minus 74 is 13. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe subtract 865 by a large number to get close to 44. 865 minus 821 is 44. But where would I get 821? The numbers left are 87, 74, 16. Let's see: 87 * 9 is 783, but that's not helpful. 74*11 is 814, which is close. Wait, 74*11=814, so 74*11 +7 would be 821, but I don't have 11 or 7. Alternatively, using 87 and 16. 87*9=783, which is still not there.\n\nThis approach might not be working. Let's try another angle. Let's look at 16. 16 is a nice number because 44 is a multiple of 4, and 16 is 4 squared. Maybe 16 can be used in a division or multiplication. For example, 16 * 2.75 =44. But how to get 2.75 from the other numbers. Let's see. 87,74,865. Maybe 865 divided by something. 865 divided by 314.5 is 2.75, but that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps combining 87 and 74 first. Let's see: 87 -74=13. Then 13 * something. 13*3.384 is 44. But again, not sure. Maybe 87 +74=161. Then 161 divided by something. 161/3.66 is about 44. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe using 865 and 16 together. 865 divided by 16 is about 54.0625. That's higher than 44. If I subtract 10 from that, I get 44.0625. But where do I get 10? The remaining numbers are 87 and 74. 87 minus 74 is 13. Not 10. Alternatively, 74 divided by 16 is 4.625. If I subtract that from 54.0625, I get 49.4375. Not helpful.\n\nWhat if I subtract 865 by something to get a number that can be divided by 16 to get 44. Let's see, 44*16=704. So 865 - something =704. Then the something is 865-704=161. Do I have 161? Let's see, 87 +74=161. Yes! So 865 - (87+74) =704. Then 704 divided by 16 is 44. So putting it all together: (865 - (87 +74)) /16=44. Let me check that.\n\nCalculating inside the parentheses first: 87 +74=161. Then 865 -161=704. Then 704 divided by 16 is indeed 44. So that works. Let me verify if all numbers are used once: 865,87,74,16. Yes, all used. And the operations are +, -, /, which are allowed. So this equation would be (865 - 87 -74)/16=44. Alternatively, (865 - (87+74))/16=44. Either way, it's the same calculation. So the equation is correct.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(865 - 87 - 74) / 16 = 44</answer>"}]}

Since the numbers are all in the range of 45 to 92, except 71, which is a bit lower. Let me try combining some of the larger numbers first.\n\nIf I subtract two numbers, like 92 - 45, that gives me 47. Not sure how that helps. Alternatively, adding 90 and 92 gives 182, which is still less than 326. Maybe multiplying some numbers. Let's see, 90 multiplied by something. 90*3 would be 270, but I don't have a 3. Wait, 90*3.6 is around 324, which is close. But how to get 3.6 from the remaining numbers? 71 and 45 maybe. 71 divided by something. 71 divided by 45 is approximately 1.577, not 3.6. Hmm, maybe that's not the way.\n\nAlternatively, if I take 90 and multiply it by 3, but again, not having a 3. Wait, maybe combine 92 and 71. 92 minus 71 is 21. Then 90*21 would be 1890, way too big. Not helpful.\n\nWhat if I do 92 * 3.5? That would be 322, close to 326. How to get 3.5 from the remaining numbers. Let's see, 71 and 45. 71 divided by 20.28, but I don't have 20.28. Alternatively, 45 divided by something. 45/12.857 is 3.5. Hmm, not sure. Maybe that's not the right approach.\n\nLet's try a different approach. Maybe 90 + 92 = 182. Then 182 + 71 = 253. 253 + 45 = 298. That's too low. Need 28 more. But we've used all numbers. Hmm.\n\nWait, what if we subtract instead? Let's see: 92 + 90 = 182. Then 182 + 71 = 253. Then 253 - 45 = 208. Still not enough. No.\n\nAlternatively, multiply two numbers. Let's think: 90 * 3 = 270, but again, need a 3. Maybe 71 - 45 = 26. Then 90 * 26 would be 2340, which is way too big. Not helpful.\n\nWait, 71 * 4.6 is approximately 326.6. Close to 326. How to get 4.6 from the remaining numbers. Let's see: 92, 90, 45. Maybe 90 - (45 / something). 45 divided by 10 is 4.5. But where's the 10? 92 - 90 = 2. 45 divided by 2 is 22.5. Then 90 - 22.5 is 67.5. Not helpful. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, 92 / something. 92 divided by 20 is 4.6. But how to get 20 from 90 and 45. 90 - 45 = 45. 45/2.25=20. But again, not helpful. Maybe this is too convoluted.\n\nWait, perhaps combining multiplication and addition. Let's see: 90 * 3 = 270. Then 270 + 71 = 341. Then 341 - 15 = 326. But where do I get 15? 45 divided by 3 is 15, but I don't have a 3. Alternatively, 90 - 45 = 45. Then 45 - 92 = -47. Not helpful.\n\nWait, let's try 90 * 3. Let's use 45 to get 3. Like 90 * (45/15) = 90*3. But how to get 15 from the remaining numbers. 71 and 92. 92 - 71 = 21. 21 - 6 = 15. But where's the 6. Not helpful.\n\nHmm, maybe 92 * 3.5. Let's see. 3.5 is 7/2. So if I can get 7/2 from the other numbers. 70 divided by something. Wait, 71 - 45 = 26. 90 divided by 26 is about 3.46. If I multiply 92 by 3.46, that's around 318. Then adding 90-26=64, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 71 * 4. Let's see 71*4=284. Then 284 + 45=329. Then subtract 3=326. But how to get 3 from 90 and 92. 92 -90=2. Not enough. Or 92/90 is about 1.02. Not helpful.\n\nWait, 92 - (90/45) = 92 - 2 =90. Then 71 * (90) is 6390. Way too big. Not useful.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe group numbers into two parts. For example, (90 + 45) = 135. Then 135 * 2.414 ≈ 326. How to get 2.414. Maybe 92 divided by something. 92 / 71 ≈1.295. Then 1.295 +1=2.295. Not close enough. Hmm.\n\nWait, 71 + 45 = 116. Then 116 * something. 326 /116 ≈2.81. How to get 2.81 from 90 and 92. Maybe 92 - 90 =2. Then 2.81 not possible. Alternatively, 90/ (92- something). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, 92 * 3 = 276. 276 + 71 =347. 347 -21=326. How to get 21? 90 - (45 + 24). But 24 isn't available. Maybe 45 - (90/ something). 90/2=45. So 45 -45=0. Not helpful.\n\nWait, let's try using division. For example, 90 divided by 45 is 2. Then 92 * 2 =184. 184 +71=255. Not enough. Alternatively, 92 - (90/45)=92-2=90. 90+71=161. 161+45=206. Nope.\n\nHmm, perhaps 92 * 71 is way too big (6532). Subtract something? 6532 - (90*45)=6532-4050=2482. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 90 * 71 = 6390. Divide by something. 6390 /45=142. Then 142 +92=234. Not close.\n\nWait, maybe subtract two products. For example, (90 * 45) - (92 * something) =326. Let's compute 90*45=4050. Then 4050 - (92x) =326. So 92x=4050-326=3724. 3724/92≈40.478. Not helpful since we don't have 40.478.\n\nAlternatively, (92*45)=4140. 4140 - (90*71)=4140-6390= -2250. Not helpful.\n\nWhat about (90 +71) =161. Then 161 * 2 =322. Close to 326. Then add 4. How to get 4? 92-45=47. 47/ something. Not 4. 45 divided by 11.25=4. But 92-71=21. 21/5.25=4. But 5.25 comes from where?\n\nAlternatively, 92 - (45 +71) =92-116= -24. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe (90 +92) =182. Then 182 * 1.8=327.6. Close to 326. How to get 1.8 from 45 and71. 71 divided by 45 is approximately 1.577. Not 1.8. Alternatively, (45 +71)=116. 116/ something. 116/64.44=1.8. But 64.44 comes from where?\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Let me try another approach. Let's list possible combinations step by step.\n\nFirst, pick two numbers and an operation, then combine with another number and operation, etc. Since we need to use all four numbers, maybe parenthetical expressions are needed.\n\nFor example:\n\n(45 + 90) =135. Then 135 * something. 326 /135 ≈2.414. So 2.414 could be (92 /71)=1.295. Then 135 * (92/71) ≈135*1.295≈174.8. Not enough.\n\nAlternatively, 135 + (92 -71)=135 +21=156. Then 156 + something. Not helpful.\n\nHow about 92 * 71 =6532. Then 6532 / (90 -45)=6532/45≈145.16. No.\n\nWait, maybe 92 * (90 / (45)) )=92*2=184. Then 184 +71=255. No.\n\nOr 92 * (90 -45)=92*45=4140. 4140/71≈58.3. Not close.\n\nWait, let's try 71 * 4.6 ≈326.6. So if I can get 4.6 using 45,90,92. Let's see, 90 - (45 / (92 - x)). Wait, 92 - something. Maybe 92 - 45=47. 45/47≈0.957. Then 90 -0.957=89.043. Not helpful. Alternatively, 92 / (90 -45)=92/45≈2.044. Then 71 *2.044≈145. Not close.\n\nAlternatively, (90 +45) / something. 135 / something = approx 4.6. 135 /29.3≈4.6. How to get 29.3 from 92 and71. 92 -71=21. 21+8.3=29.3. No.\n\nHmm. Maybe combining two operations. Let's see, 90 * 3.6 =324. 324 +2=326. How to get 3.6 and 2. 3.6 could be 45/12.5. 12.5 from 71-92= -21. Not helpful. Alternatively, 90*( (92 -71)/ something ). 92-71=21. 21 divided by 5.833=3.6. 5.833 is 45/7.7. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, 92 - (90 / (45/71)). Let's compute denominator: 45/71≈0.6338. Then 90/0.6338≈142. Then 92 -142= -50. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe (90 * 45) - (92 *71) =4050 -6532= -2482. Not helpful.\n\nHow about (92 +71) * something. 92+71=163. 163*2=326. Oh! Wait, that's 163*2=326. So I need to get 2 from the remaining numbers 45 and90. How? 90 divided by45 is 2. Yes! So (92 +71) * (90 /45) = (163) * 2 =326. Let me check:\n\n92 +71=163. 90 divided by45=2. Then 163*2=326. And all numbers are used once. That works!\n\nSo the equation is (92 +71) * (90 /45) =326.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(92 + 71) * (90 / 45)</answer>"}]}

Hmm, let's start by thinking about the target number. 477 is a bit over 400, so maybe multiplication could get me there. Let's see, the largest numbers here are 93 and 38. If I multiply them, 93*38 is 3534, which is way too big. That's not helpful. Maybe subtract them? 93-38 is 55, which doesn't help much.\n\nWait, maybe I can use division to reduce some of the larger numbers. Let's see. If I take 93 and divide it by something... like 93/15 is 6.2, but that's a decimal. Maybe not ideal. What if I multiply 38 and 15? 38*15 is 570. Then maybe subtract something. 570 - 93 = 477. Oh, wait, that's 477. But then where does the 1 come in? Because I have to use all numbers. Hmm. So 38*15 is 570, minus 93 is 477. But then I still have the 1 left. How can I incorporate 1 into that equation? Maybe 1 is part of a division or addition that doesn't change the result much. Like 1+ (38*15) -93? That would be 1 + 570 -93 = 478 -93 = 385. No, that's not right. Alternatively, maybe (38*15) - (93 +1) = 570 -94 = 476. Close, but not 477.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 93*5 = 465. If I can get 5 from the other numbers. Let's see, 38 -15 is 23. 23 divided by something. 23/1 is 23. Hmm, not helpful. Alternatively, 15 -1 =14. 38/14 is about 2.7. Not helpful. Maybe 93*(15 - (38/1))? Let's compute that: 15 -38 is -23, so 93*(-23) is -2139. Not helpful. \n\nWait, let's think differently. Let's try to get close to 477. 93*5=465. 465 +12=477. How can I get 12? 38-15=23. 23-11=12. Wait, but that's using more numbers. Alternatively, 15 - (38/ something). If I do 38 divided by something to get 2, then 15 -2=13. 93*5=465, 465+13=478. Close. Hmm. Alternatively, 93*5 +12 = 477. Let's see, how to get 12. 38-15-1=22, which is too much. Or 38/(15+1)= 38/16=2.375. 15 -2.375=12.625. 93*5 +12.625=477.625. Not exact. \n\nAlternatively, maybe 93*(38-15) -1. Let's calculate that. 38-15=23. 93*23=2139. 2139-1=2138. Way too big. \n\nWait, what if I do (93 -15) * something. 93-15=78. 78*6=468. Close to 477. 468 +9=477. How to get 9 from 38 and 1. 38/ (1 something). 38 divided by 4.222...? Not sure. 38-29=9, but how to get 29 from 1? Not possible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe 93 + 38*15 -1. Let's compute that. 38*15=570. 93+570=663. 663-1=662. Not close. \n\nHmm, perhaps using division in a different way. Let's see, 93 * (38 - (15/1)). Let's compute that: 15/1=15. 38-15=23. 93*23=2139. Still too big. \n\nWait, maybe 93* (something) where the something is around 5.1, because 93*5.1≈474.3. Close. So how to make 5.1 with 38,15,1. Let's see. 38/(15-1)=38/14≈2.714. Then 15-2.714≈12.286. Not helpful. Alternatively, 15 - (38/1)=15-38= -23. No. Maybe (15 +38)/1=53. Then 93 -53=40. 40* something? Not helpful. \n\nWait, 93* ( (38 +1)/15 ). Let's compute (38+1)=39. 39/15=2.6. 93*2.6=241.8. Not close. \n\nAlternatively, maybe (93 -1)* (15 - (38))... No, that's getting messy. \n\nWait, another approach: 477 divided by 93 is approximately 5.129. So if I can make 5.129 with 38,15,1. Not sure. Alternatively, 477 divided by 15 is 31.8. Maybe 93 - (38 +1) = 54. 54* something. Not helpful. \n\nWait, let's think again. Earlier, I had 38*15=570. Then 570 -93=477. That's correct, but then how to include the 1? Because all numbers must be used. So maybe I need to use the 1 in a way that doesn't change the value. For example, multiplying by 1 or adding 0 (which would be 1-1, but I can't reuse numbers). Wait, but if I do (38*15) -93 + (1-1), but that uses 1 twice. Not allowed. \n\nAlternatively, maybe (38*15) - (93 -1). Let's compute that: 93-1=92. 38*15=570. 570-92=478. Not 477. Close but no. \n\nOr (38*15) -93 +1. 570 -93=477, then 477+1=478. So that's 478. Not helpful. \n\nHmm. So the problem is that if I use 38*15 -93, that gives me exactly 477, but I haven't used the 1. So I need to find a way to include the 1 in the equation without affecting the result. The only way is to multiply by 1 or add 0. But adding 0 would require 1-1, which isn't allowed here. Multiplying by 1 would require something like (38*15 -93)*1. Which would work. Wait, but the numbers have to be used once each. So if I do 38*15 -93*1, is that allowed? Let's check: 38,15,93,1 are all used once. So 38 multiplied by 15 is 570, then subtract 93 multiplied by 1, which is 93. 570 -93 = 477. Yes! That works. So the equation would be 38*15 -93*1. Let me check: 38*15=570, 93*1=93, 570-93=477. And all numbers are used once. Perfect. So that's the solution.\n</think>\n\n<answer>38 * 15 - 93 * 1 = 477</answer>"}]}

Let me start by thinking about factors of 720 to see if I can break it down into parts. 720 is 72*10, or 8*9*10, or maybe 24*30. Hmm. Let's see.\n\nFirst, let's list the numbers again: 62, 48, 15, 62. Wait, two 62s? So even though they are the same number, I have to use each once. So maybe use them in different operations. \n\nLet me try to see possible combinations. If I multiply 48 and 15, that gives me 720. Wait, 48*15 is 720. Oh! Wait, 48*15 is exactly 720. But how do the 62s come into play here? Because if I can get 48 and 15 from the numbers given, but I need to use both 62s and the other numbers. Wait, but the numbers given are 62, 48, 15, 62. So if I need to use all four numbers, but 48 and 15 would multiply to 720, but then what do I do with the two 62s? Maybe subtract or add them in some way?\n\nAlternatively, maybe combine the 62s first. Let's see, 62 + 62 is 124. Then 124 combined with 48 and 15. Hmm, maybe 124 - 48 = 76, then 76 * 15 = 1140. That's not 720. Or 124 + 48 = 172, 172 *15=2580. No. Maybe divide. 124 / (48 -15) = 124 /33 ≈3.75, not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe multiply the two 62s: 62*62=3844. That's way too big. Maybe subtract them: 62-62=0. That would zero out, which isn't helpful. So that's probably not useful.\n\nAlternatively, can I use 62 and 48 in some operation? 62*48=2976. Then what's left is 15 and 62. 2976 + 15 +62= 3053, way too big. If I divide 2976 by something... Let's see. Suppose 62*48=2976. Then 2976 divided by (something) equals 720. So 2976 /720=4.133... Not an integer. Maybe 2976 divided by 4.133 is 720, but 4.133 isn't 62 or 15. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 62+48=110. Then 110 *15=1650. Then subtract 62? 1650-62=1588. Not 720. \n\nWait, maybe 62 - 48=14. Then 14*15=210. 210 +62=272. Not helpful.\n\nWait, let me think again. Since 48*15=720, maybe I need to get 48 and 15 from the given numbers, but using the two 62s somehow. For example, 62 - (something) =48 or 15. Let's see. 62-14=48. So if I can get 14 from the remaining numbers. The remaining numbers would be 62 and 15. But 15 - 62 is negative. Not helpful. Alternatively, 62 divided by something. 62/ (something) to get 48? 62/48 is about 1.29. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 62 - (62 -48) =62 -14=48. Wait, but that uses 62 twice and 48 once. Then 48 *15=720. But let's check: (62 - (62 -48)) *15 = (62 -14)*15=48*15=720. But the numbers used here would be 62, 62, 48, 15. Each used once. Wait, original numbers are 62,48,15,62. So if I take 62, subtract (62-48), that uses two 62s, 48, and then multiply by 15. So that would be (62 - (62 -48)) *15. Let's compute that: inside the parentheses, 62-48=14, then 62-14=48. Then 48*15=720. So yes! That uses all four numbers: two 62s, 48, and 15. Each exactly once. Let me check:\n\nFirst 62 is used in the first part, then the second 62 is used in (62 -48), then 48 is used there, and 15 is multiplied. So all four numbers are used once. That works. So the equation is (62 - (62 - 48)) * 15 = 720. Let me write that as (62 - (62 - 48)) * 15. That uses each number once. Let me verify the calculation step by step:\n\nFirst, compute the inner parentheses: 62 -48=14.\n\nThen subtract that from the first 62: 62 -14=48.\n\nMultiply by 15: 48*15=720. Perfect. So that works. Therefore, the equation is (62 - (62 - 48)) * 15 = 720. Which uses all four numbers once each.

I need to use all the numbers 4, 64, 16, and 55 exactly once each with basic arithmetic operations to get 55. Hmm. The target is 55, which is already one of the numbers, so maybe I can somehow subtract or add something to 55 to get it. Wait, but I have to use all the numbers. So maybe 55 is the result, and the other numbers need to combine in a way that cancels out.\n\nLet me think. Let's list out the numbers: 4, 64, 16, 55. The target is 55. So perhaps I can do something like 55 plus (something minus something else) equals 55. But then the other terms would need to cancel each other out. For example, 55 + (4 + 16 - 64) would be 55 + (20 - 64) = 55 -44 =11, which isn't right. Alternatively, maybe multiplication or division can help.\n\nLooking at 64 and 16, 64 divided by 16 is 4. Oh, wait, but I already have 4 as a separate number. If I do 64 /16 =4, then maybe I can use that 4 with the existing 4. Wait, but each number can only be used once. So if I use 64 divided by 16 to get 4, but I already have a 4, which would mean I can't reuse that. So maybe that's not the way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 16 divided by 4 is 4. Then 64 minus 4 would be 60. Then 60 minus something would be 55. Wait, but we have to use all numbers. Let's see: 64 - (16 /4) = 64 -4=60. Then 60 - (the remaining number) which is 55. Wait, but 60 -55=5, which doesn't help. Hmm. Alternatively, 64 divided by 4 is 16. Then we have 16 and 16, but we can't reuse numbers. So that might not work.\n\nWait, maybe I need to use subtraction and division. Let's try different combinations. Let's consider 55 as part of the equation. For example, 55 = ... So maybe 55 multiplied by something divided by something. But I need to use all numbers. Let's see.\n\nAnother approach: Let's try to make 55 using the other numbers. Since 55 is prime, but maybe combining operations. Let's see. For example, 64 - 16 =48. Then 48 +4=52. Not enough. 64 - (16/4) =64-4=60. Then 60-5=55, but where would the 5 come from? Wait, we don't have a 5. Hmm. Alternatively, 16 -4=12. 64/12 is roughly 5.333, which isn't helpful. \n\nWait, maybe 64 divided by 16 is 4. Then we have 4 and 4. But we can't reuse 4. So that's a problem. Alternatively, maybe (64 -16) /4 =48/4=12. Then 12 + something. But then we have 55 left. 12 +55=67, which isn't 55. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, 64 - (4*16) =64-64=0. Then 0 +55=55. Wait, that could work. Let's check: 4*16=64, then 64-64=0. Then 0 +55=55. But here, I used 4,16,64, and 55. Each exactly once. Let's verify:\n\nThe equation would be (4 * 16) - 64 + 55. Wait, but order of operations. Let's see: 4*16=64. Then 64-64=0. Then 0 +55=55. So the equation is 4*16 -64 +55. But wait, that uses all numbers: 4,16,64,55. But in this equation, the operations are multiplication, subtraction, and addition. Each number is used once. Does that work? Let me check:\n\n4 * 16 = 64, subtract 64 gives 0, then add 55. So the total is 55. Yes. But does the structure of the equation work? Let's write it as ((4 * 16) - 64) + 55. But since all operations are left to right with multiplication first, it would be 4*16=64, then 64-64=0, then 0+55=55. So the equation would be 4*16 -64 +55 =55. But that uses all numbers once. Wait, but 55 is already in there as a term. So is that allowed? The problem says you must use all the numbers, so as long as each is used once in the equation. So yes, this works.\n\nBut let me confirm the problem statement again: create an equation equal to 55 using each number exactly once. So 4, 64, 16, 55. All used once. So in the equation 4*16 -64 +55 =55. That works. Let me check: 4*16=64; 64-64=0; 0+55=55. So yes, the equation is valid. All numbers used once. Operations are multiplication, subtraction, and addition. Each used once or multiple times. The problem allows using operations multiple times. So this seems to satisfy all conditions.\n\nSo the equation is 4*16 -64 +55 =55. Or written with parentheses for clarity, but since multiplication comes first, they might not be necessary. Alternatively, ((4 * 16) - 64) + 55. But the problem says to return the equation, not the result. So the equation would be 4*16 -64 +55. Since that's the left-hand side, and it equals 55. So maybe writing it as 4*16 -64 +55 =55, but the problem might just want the expression that equals 55. Let me check the example: the example given is (1 + 2)/3, which is an expression. So perhaps we should present the expression that evaluates to 55, using all the numbers once. So in this case, the expression is 4*16 -64 +55. Which equals 55. Let me check again:\n\n4*16 is 64. Then 64 -64 is 0. Then 0 +55 is 55. So yes. So the equation is correct.\n\nSo the answer would be <answer>4*16 - 64 + 55</answer>\n</think>\n\n<answer>4*16 - 64 + 55</answer>"}]}

Oh, 350 is 10 more than 340. But how can I adjust that? Maybe subtract something. Wait, the remaining numbers are 76 and 86.

Let me compute that again: 86-76 is 10, so 350 -10=340. Correct. So the equation is 25*14 - (86 -76) =340. But wait, is that using all numbers? Yes: 25,14,86,76. All four numbers used once each. Great. So that's a possible solution. Let me see if there's another way, but this seems straightforward. Alternatively, maybe 76 and 86 can be combined. 86 +76=162. Not sure. 86-76=10 again. Or 86/76 is roughly 1.13. Not helpful. 25*14 is 350, which is close. Then subtract 10. So yeah, that seems the way. Another approach: 86 -14=72. Then 72* something. 72*5=360. But 5 is 25/5. Hmm, maybe 72*(25/5) but 5 isn't a given number. Alternatively, 25+76=101. 101* something. 101*3.3 is 333.3. Not helpful. Maybe 76*5=380. Then subtract 40, but 40 isn't a number. Wait, 86 - (25+14)=86-39=47. Not helpful. Alternatively, 76 + 86=162. 162*2=324. Then add 16, but 16 isn't there. Hmm. Maybe 25*86=2150. That's way too big. Divide by something. 2150/14 is about 153.5. Not helpful. How about 76*25=1900. 1900 divided by something. 1900/5=380. 5 isn't a number here. Maybe 1900/ (86-14)=1900/72≈26.38. Not helpful. Let's go back to the first solution. 25*14=350, subtract (86-76)=10. 350-10=340. That uses all four numbers. That works. So the equation would be 25 × 14 - (86 - 76) = 340. Let me just verify the arithmetic again to be sure. 25*14: 25*10=250, 25*4=100, so 250+100=350. 86-76=10. 350-10=340. Yes. Perfect. So that's the equation.\n</think>\n\n<answer>25*14 - (86 - 76) = 340</answer>"}]}

Hmm.\n\nFirst, I'll try to get a sense of the target. 244 is a bit over 200. Let me check if combining the larger numbers can get close. The two biggest numbers here are 88 and 83. If I add them together, 88 + 83 = 171. That's still under 244. Then maybe multiply that sum by something. But I have 28 and 7 left. 28 and 7. Let me see, 28 divided by 7 is 4. So if I take 171 and add 4, that's 175. Not enough. Alternatively, if I multiply 171 by (28/7) which is 4, that would be 171 *4 = 684. Too big. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe subtract something. Let's see: 88 - 28 = 60. Then 83 -7=76. 60 +76=136. Still too low. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe multiply some numbers. Let's consider 83 * 3 = 249, which is close to 244. But how to get 3? 28 divided by 7 is 4, subtract 1 from that? But I need to use all numbers. Wait, if I use 88, 28, 83, 7. Let's see: 83 * (28 /7) = 83 *4 = 332. Then subtract 88? 332 -88=244. Oh! Wait, let me check that again. 28 divided by 7 is 4. Multiply by 83 gives 83*4=332. Then subtract 88: 332-88=244. Yes! But do I use all numbers? Let's see: 83 is used, 28 and 7 are used in division, and 88 is subtracted. All four numbers are used once. So the equation would be 83*(28/7) -88 =244. Let me calculate that again to confirm. 28 divided by 7 is 4. 83 times 4 is 332. 332 minus 88 is indeed 244. That works! So the equation is 83*(28/7) -88. Yeah, that should do it.\n</think>\n\n<answer>83*(28/7) - 88 = 244</answer>"}]}

Wait, 644 plus 70 is 714, which is way over. 644 plus 36 is 680, still too big. If I subtract, maybe. 644 minus 70 is 574, which is lower than 653. The difference is 79. Hmm, but 97 is one of the numbers. Wait, 644 - 70 = 574. Then 574 + 97 = 671. That's over. Alternatively, 644 - 97 = 547. Then 547 + 70 = 617, still not there. \n\nAnother approach: Maybe multiply some numbers. Let's see. If I use 70 and 36. 70*36 is 2520. That's way too big.

Let's think: 70 + 36 = 106. Then 106 - 97 = 9. Then 644 + 9 = 653. Oh! Wait, that could work. Let me check again. \n\nSo 70 + 36 is 106. Then 106 - 97 = 9. Then adding that to 644 gives 653. So the equation would be 644 + (70 + 36 - 97) = 653. Let's verify: 70 +36=106, 106-97=9, 644+9=653. Yes! But I need to use all four numbers. Wait, that uses 644,70,36,97. All of them.

All numbers must be used once, and I can use basic operations. Hmm, let's start by thinking about the target number, 322. What's 322 in relation to these numbers? Let's check some possibilities.\n\nFirst, maybe adding some of them. Let's see: 291 is the largest number here. If I subtract something from 291, can I get close to 322? Wait, 291 is less than 322, so subtracting would make it smaller. So maybe adding 291 and another number. Let's try 291 + 57. That gives 348. Hmm, 348 is higher than 322. The difference is 26. Wait, 348 - 26 = 322. Oh! Wait, but I have 26 as one of the numbers. So maybe 291 + 57 - 26? Let me check: 291 +57 is 348, minus 26 is 322. But then where does the 1 come in? Oh, right, I need to use all numbers. So that approach uses 291,57,26 but leaves out 1. So that's a problem.\n\nHmm. So maybe I need to find a way to include 1. Maybe multiply or divide by 1. Since multiplying by 1 doesn't change the number. Let's see. Maybe something like (291 + 57) + (26 × 1). Let's compute that: 291+57=348, 26×1=26. Then 348 +26=374. That's way over. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 291 + (57 × something) involving 26 and 1. Let's think. Suppose I do 57 × 26. That's 57×26. Let me calculate: 50×26=1300, 7×26=182. So total 1300+182=1482. Then adding 291 and 1? That's way too big. 1482 +291=1773, plus 1 is 1774. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe subtract instead. What's 57 × something minus another number. Let's see. 57×5=285. If I do 57×6=342. Hmm. 342 is close to 322. 342 -20=322. But how to get 20 from the remaining numbers. The remaining numbers would be 26, 291, and 1. Not sure. Alternatively, maybe 57× something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 291 divided by something. 291 divided by 1 is 291. Then adding 57 and 26: 291 +57=348 +26=374. No. Not 322.\n\nWait, maybe 291 minus (57 × something). Let's try. 57 ×5=285. 291-285=6. Then plus 26 and 1? 6+26=32, +1=33. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 26 × something. Let's see. 26×12=312. 312 +10=322. But how to get 12 and 10 from the other numbers. The other numbers are 291,57,1. Not obvious.\n\nWait, maybe combining two numbers first. For example, 291 - 26 =265. Then 265 +57=322. Wait, 265+57=322? Let's check: 265+50=315, +7=322. Yes! So 291 -26 +57=322. But then where does the 1 come into play? Because I need to use all four numbers. So that's 291,26,57 used, but 1 is left. So how can I include the 1?\n\nAh, maybe I can use the 1 in a division or multiplication that doesn't affect the result. For example, multiply by 1 or add 0 (which would require subtracting and adding 1). Wait, but how. Let's see. If I have (291 -26) +57 +1 -1, but that would be using 1 twice, which is not allowed. Alternatively, maybe 291 -26 +57 + (1 × something). But 1× anything is that number. So maybe 291 -26 +57 +1. Let's compute: 291-26=265; 265+57=322; 322+1=323. That's one over. So that's not it. Alternatively, 291 -26 +57 -1=322-1=321. Not 322. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (291 +57) - (26 -1). Let's compute: 26-1=25. Then 291+57=348; 348-25=323. Still not 322. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps (291 + (57 × something)) involving 26 and 1. Let's think. Let me try 57 × (26 -1). 26-1=25. 57×25. 57×25 is 1425. Then 1425 +291=1716. No, way too big.\n\nAlternatively, maybe divide 291 by 1 to get 291. Then 291 +57=348. Then 348 -26=322. Again, that's the same as before, but missing the 1. So unless we can insert the 1 in a way that doesn't change the result, like multiplying by 1. For example, (291 +57 -26) ×1. That would be 322×1=322. But then all numbers are used: 291,57,26,1. Wait, yes! Let me check: 291 +57 =348. 348 -26=322. Then multiply by 1. So the equation would be (291 +57 -26) ×1=322. That uses all numbers once. Let me verify:\n\n291 +57 =348\n\n348 -26 =322\n\n322 ×1 =322.\n\nYes! So the equation is (291 +57 -26) ×1 =322. All numbers used once. That works. But wait, does the order of operations allow that? Let me see. Since multiplication comes last. So yes, the parentheses first: 291+57-26 =322, then multiplied by 1. So the equation is (291 +57 -26) * 1 =322. Perfect. That uses all numbers once. So the answer would be <answer>(291 + 57 - 26) * 1</answer>\n\nAlternatively, maybe another arrangement. Let's confirm there's no other way. Let me think. Another possibility: 57 × 26 = 1482. Then 1482 - 291=1191. Then 1191 divided by something with 1. 1191 / (something). But 1191/3.7... Not helpful. So that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 291 +26=317. Then 317 +57=374, minus 1=373. Not 322.\n\nHmm. So the previous solution seems the only way. Using (291 +57 -26) multiplied by 1. Because 1 has to be used, and multiplying by 1 doesn't change the value. So that's probably the correct answer.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(291 + 57 - 26) * 1</answer>"}]}

Well, 992 divided by 62 is 16, because 62 times 16 is 992. Wait, 62 is one of the numbers here. So maybe if I can get 62 multiplied by something that equals 992, that could work. Then I need to create 16 using the remaining numbers: 94, 8, and 47.\n\nWait, but how can I make 16 from 94, 8, and 47? Let me check. Let's see: 94 minus 47 is 47. Then 47 divided by something? Not sure. Alternatively, 47 minus (94/8)? But 94 divided by 8 is 11.75, so 47 minus that is around 35.25, which isn't helpful. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 94 divided by something. 94 divided by (47/8). Let's calculate that: 47 divided by 8 is 5.875. Then 94 divided by 5.875 is 16. So that's 94 ÷ (47/8) = 16. Because dividing by a fraction is multiplying by its reciprocal, so 94 * (8/47) = (94*8)/47. Let me compute that: 94 divided by 47 is 2, so 2*8=16. Oh right! So that works. So 94 divided by (47/8) equals 16. So then 62 multiplied by that would be 62*16=992. So putting it all together: 62 * (94 / (47 / 8)) = 992.\n\nLet me check the numbers used: 62, 94, 47, 8. All used once. Operations are division inside the parentheses, then multiplication. So yes. Let me verify the calculation step by step. First, the inner division: 47 divided by 8 is 47/8. Then 94 divided by that is 94 * (8/47) = (94/47)*8 = 2*8=16. Then 62*16=992. Perfect. So that works.\n</think>\n\n<answer>62 * (94 / (47 / 8))</answer>"}]}

Maybe not. Alternatively, 45 + 16 = 61. Then 82 - 61 = 21. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe combining 58 and 45. 58 - 45 is 13. Then 13 + 16 = 29. Still not 41. Alternatively, 58 + 45 = 103.

If I subtract something from 571, maybe I can get close to 661. Let's see: 571 - (something) = 661? Wait, that would require subtracting a negative number, which might not be straightforward.

Or maybe 42 times 16 (but 16 isn't one of the numbers). Wait, the numbers are 42, 571, 21, 69. So maybe 42*21 is 882. Then subtract 571 from that: 882 - 571 = 311. Not helpful.

That would be 621 +42=663, which is 2 more than 661. But we need to use all numbers. Wait, maybe 69* (something) + or - another number.\n\nWait, let's see. Let's list all possible operations and combinations. Let's think about division as well. For example, 571 divided by something. 571/21 is approximately 27.19. Not sure if that helps. 42 divided by 21 is 2. So 42/21 = 2. Then maybe 571 - 2 = 569. Then adding 69 would be 569 +69=638. Not 661. Hmm.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe 571 + 69 = 640. Then we need 21 more, but we have 42 and 21 left. Wait, 42 -21 =21. So 571 +69 + (42-21) = 571+69+21= 661. Wait, let me check that. 571 +69 is 640. Then 42 -21 is 21. 640 +21=661. Yes! But wait, does that use all numbers? Let's see: 571, 69, 42, 21. Yes. So the equation would be 571 + 69 + (42 -21) = 661. Let me verify the arithmetic:\n\n42 -21 =21. Then 571 +69 =640. 640 +21=661. Perfect. That uses all numbers once with addition and subtraction. So the equation is 571 + 69 + (42 -21) = 661. Let me make sure I didn't miss any other possible operations, but this seems to work. Let me check if the parentheses are necessary. Since addition and subtraction are left associative, without parentheses it would be 571 +69 +42 -21. Which is the same as (571 +69) + (42 -21). So yes, that works. So the equation is 571 +69 +42 -21=661. But maybe to group the subtraction part, it's better to write (42 -21). Either way, both expressions are equivalent. But according to the problem statement, they want an equation that equals 661. So either way is correct. But let's present it with parentheses for clarity.\n</think>\n\n<answer>571 + 69 + (42 - 21) = 661</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using all the numbers 646, 4, 36, and 798 exactly once, with basic operations, to get 161. Hmm. Let me start by thinking about how these numbers can combine. \n\nFirst, 161 is a relatively small number compared to some of these numbers like 646 and 798. Maybe I need to subtract or divide the larger numbers to bring them down. Let's list out the numbers: 646, 4, 36, 798. The target is 161.\n\nLet me consider possible operations. Since 646 is about four times 161 (since 160*4=640, so 161*4=644, which is close to 646). Wait, 646 divided by 4 is 161.5. Oh, that's close to 161. But 646 divided by 4.01 would give 161, but I don't have 0.01. Alternatively, maybe using another number to adjust. But the problem requires using all numbers once. So if I do 646 divided by 4, that's 161.5. Then maybe subtract 0.5 using another number. But how can I get 0.5 from 36 and 798? That seems tricky. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 798 divided by something. Let's see: 798 divided by 4 is 199.5. Not helpful. 798 divided by 36 is about 22.166... Hmm. 36 times 4 is 144. 144 plus something? 144 plus 17 would be 161. How to get 17 from the remaining numbers. Wait, the remaining numbers would be 646 and 798. But that's not possible. Wait, all numbers have to be used. So if I use 36*4 =144, then need to get 17 from 646 and 798. But 798 -646 is 152. 152 divided by something? Not sure. Maybe this path isn't working.\n\nAnother approach: Let's try combining 646 and 798. 798 - 646 = 152. Then 152 plus or minus something. But 152 + 9 = 161. How to get 9 from 36 and 4. 36 divided by 4 is 9. So maybe (798 - 646) + (36 /4) = 152 +9=161. Wait, that uses 798, 646, 36, and 4. Yes! Let me check:\n\n798 - 646 = 152\n\n36 /4 =9\n\n152 +9=161.\n\nThat uses all numbers once. But let me confirm the equation structure. The equation would be (798 - 646) + (36 / 4) = 161. But let's compute each step:\n\nFirst, 798 -646 is 152. Then 36 divided by 4 is 9. 152 +9=161. Exactly. So that works. So the equation is (798 - 646) + (36 / 4) = 161.\n\nWait, but does that use all numbers exactly once? Let's see: 798, 646, 36, 4. Yes, each is used once. And the operations are subtraction, division, and addition. All allowed. So that should be the correct answer.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(798 - 646) + (36 / 4) = 161</answer>"}]}

Let's look at the numbers provided: 45, 52, 21, 67. \n\nStarting with the larger numbers, 67 and 52. If I multiply those two, 67 * 52 = 3,484. That's way too big. Hmm. Maybe combining them with another operation. Alternatively, maybe 67 * something else. Let's check 67 * 45 = 3,015. Still way over 930. 67*21=1,407, which is also over. So maybe multiplying two of the larger numbers isn't the way to go. Maybe adding first and then multiplying. Let's see.\n\nWait, 45 and 21 are smaller. Let's see 45+21=66. If I multiply that by something else. 66*52=3,432, which is too big. 66*67=4,422. Nope. Not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, maybe 52*21=1,092. Then subtract something? 1,092 - 45=1,047. Then 1,047 -67=980. Hmm, not 930. Or maybe 52*21=1,092, then subtract 67=1,025, then subtract 45=980. Still no. \n\nAlternatively, 67*21=1,407. If I subtract 52 from that, 1,407-52=1,355. Then subtract 45=1,310. Still way higher than 930. \n\nMaybe division could help here. Let's see. If I take 67*52=3,484. If I divide that by a number. Let's say 3,484 divided by 21 is around 165.9. Then adding the remaining 45 would give 210.9, which isn't helpful. \n\nWait, maybe combining multiplication and addition. Let's try 45*21=945. Close to 930. Then 945- (67-52). Let's calculate 67-52=15. 945-15=930. Wait, that works! Let me check the numbers. 45*21=945. Then 67-52=15. Then subtract 15 from 945: 945-15=930. So the equation would be (45 * 21) - (67 - 52) = 930. Let me verify: 45*21 is indeed 945. 67-52 is 15. 945-15 is 930. And all numbers are used once each: 45,21,67,52. Perfect!

Maybe I can break it down into parts that could relate to the numbers given.\n\nFirst, looking at the numbers: 64 and 32 are both powers of 2, which might be useful. 64 is 2^6, 32 is 2^5. 33 is close to 32, just one more, and 10 is a round number. \n\nLet me consider possible combinations. Since 165 is a bit over 160, maybe combining 64 and 32 could get close. 64 + 32 is 96. That's not enough. 64 * 2 is 128, but I don't have a 2. Wait, maybe if I use 64 multiplied by something else. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, 33 is a larger number. If I subtract something from 33, or add. Let's try 33 * 5 = 165. Oh, wait, 33 times 5 is exactly 165. So maybe I can find a way to get 5 from the remaining numbers: 64, 10, 32. How to get 5? Let's see. 10 divided by 2 is 5, but do I have a 2? Maybe 32 divided by something. 32 divided by (64/10)? Wait, 64 divided by 10 is 6.4, so 32 divided by 6.4 is 5. Let me check that: 32 divided by (64/10) = 32 * (10/64) = (32*10)/64 = 320/64 = 5. Yes, that works. So then, 33 multiplied by (32 divided by (64/10)) would be 33 * 5 = 165. Let's check that all numbers are used once: 33, 32, 64, 10. Yes.

If I subtract something from 49, maybe? 49 minus something equals 68? Wait, that would require a negative number, which I don't have. So maybe addition. 49 plus what? 68 minus 49 is 19. Do I have 19? Not directly, but maybe with the other numbers. Let's see. The remaining numbers are 28, 34, 43. Hmm. Maybe 34 divided by something? 34 divided by 2 is 17, but I don't have a 2. Or maybe 43 minus 28 is 15. Not quite. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 43 plus 34. That's 77. Then subtract something. 77 minus 9 is 68.

But I don't have a 2. Alternatively, 28 times 2.44 (since 68/28 is about 2.428), but that's not straightforward. What if I can get 68 by combining two numbers and then use the others.

Maybe 49 divided by something. 49 divided by 5.44, which is not an integer. Hmm.\n\nWait another angle: 68 can be expressed as 34 * 2. Since 34 is one of the numbers, maybe 34 * (something) =68. Then the something would need to be 2. How to get 2 from the remaining numbers 28,43,49. Let's see. 49 - 43 =6. Then 28 divided by 6 is about 4.666. Not 2. Or 43 - 28=15. 15 divided by something? Not helpful. Alternatively, 49 -28=21. 43 -21=22. Not 2. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, 28 + 34 =62. Then we need 6 more. The remaining numbers are 43 and 49. 49 -43=6. So 62 + (49-43)=62+6=68.

So that should be the equation. Let me just make sure there's no mistake here. Yes, all numbers used once, and operations are basic. So the answer should be (28 + 34) + (49 - 43) = 68, but since parentheses can be adjusted, maybe write it as 28 + 34 + 49 -43. But let's check the order. Since addition and subtraction are left to right, but to group them, maybe the parentheses as (28 +34) + (49 -43). That way it's clear. Alternatively, perhaps (28 + 34) + (49 -43) =68.

If I add them, that's 67, which is way over. Multiplying them would be way too big. Dividing 35 by 32 gives a fraction, which might not be useful. So maybe combining them isn't the best approach.\n\nWhat about using 35 with 10? 35 + 10 = 45, close to 48. Then I need 3 more. But I have 32 and 2 left.

Maybe that's not working. Maybe I need to rethink.\n\nAlternatively, let's try 35 minus something. 35 - (something) = 48. Wait, that would require subtracting a negative number, which might complicate things. Not sure. Maybe multiplication. For example, 10 * 2 = 20. Then 32 - 20 = 12. Then 35 + 12 = 47. Close, but not 48. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe (35 - 32) = 3. Then 3 * 10 = 30. Then 30 + 2 = 32. Not helpful. Hmm.\n\nWhat if I do 32 divided by 2? That's 16. Then 16 * 3 = 48. But where do I get the 3? Maybe from 35 - 32 = 3. Wait, but then I have used 35, 32, 2. Then 10 is left. So 3 from 35-32, then 3 * 16 (but 16 comes from 32/2, but 32 is already used). Wait, that's conflicting. Let me write this step by step.\n\n35 - 32 = 3. Then 3 * (something) = 48. 48 /3 = 16. So I need to get 16 from the remaining numbers 2 and 10. How? 10 + 2 =12. 10 * 2 =20. 10 /2 =5. 10 -2=8. None of those are 16. So that approach doesn't work.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's use multiplication. 2 * 10 =20. Then 32 -20 =12. Then 35 +12=47. Still one short. Close. Maybe I need to adjust the operations. Maybe 32 + (2*10) =32+20=52. Then 52 -35=17. Not 48. Hmm.\n\nWhat if I do 35 + 10 =45, then need 3 more. 32 divided by something. 32 divided by (10 -2) = 32/8=4. 45 +4=49. Still not. Or 32 divided by 2=16, then 16 - (10)=6. 45 +6=51. No.\n\nWait, maybe (32 - 10) =22. Then 22 * 2 =44. Then 35 +44=79. No. Alternatively, 32 +10=42. 42 +35=77. Then subtract 2. 77-2=75. No.\n\nHmm. Maybe using division in a different way. Let's think: 35 * 2 =70. Then 70 -32=38. Then 38 +10=48. Wait, that's 70-32=38, 38+10=48. But that uses 35,2,32,10. All numbers once. Wait, but the operations are 35*2=70, 70-32=38, 38+10=48. So combining them as ((35 * 2) -32) +10 =48. Let's check: 35*2=70, 70-32=38, 38+10=48. Yes! That works. But wait, does that use all numbers once? 35, 2, 32, 10. Yes, each used once. And all operations are allowed. So the equation is (35 * 2 - 32) +10 =48. But maybe written as (35×2 -32) +10. Let me check the arithmetic again. 35×2=70, 70-32=38, 38+10=48. Correct. So that's the solution. So the equation is ((35 * 2) - 32) + 10 = 48. Or maybe without the outer parentheses: 35*2 -32 +10. Since multiplication comes first, then left to right. So yes, that's correct.\n</think>\n\n<answer>35 * 2 - 32 + 10 = 48</answer>"}]}

Hmm. 74 + 54 is 128, which is 20 less. 74 +24 is 98. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe subtract. 76 - 24 is 52. If I can combine that with 54 and 74... Not sure. Let's see. Let me check if there's a way to make 148 by adding two of the numbers and then adding the other two. For example, 76 + 74 = 150, which is 2 more than 148. Then maybe the other two numbers, 24 and 54, can be used to subtract 2. But 24 and 54. How? 54 -24 is 30. That's not helpful. 24 +54=78. Hmm. If I can do 76 +74 =150, then subtract something. 150 - (54-24) = 150 -30=120. No. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe multiply. Let's see. If I can get 148 by multiplying two numbers. But 148 factors into 2*74, 4*37, etc. But I don't have a 2 unless I make it from other numbers. Wait, maybe 76 divided by something. 76 divided by 24 is about 3.166, which doesn't help. 54 divided by 24 is 2.25. Maybe not.\n\nAnother approach: Let's list possible combinations. For example, 76 and 54. 76 +54=130. Then I have 74 and 24 left. 74 -24=50. 130 +50=180. No. 74 +24=98. 130 +98=228. Too big. 74*24=1776. Way too big. 74/24≈3.08. Not useful.\n\nWait, maybe 76 -24=52. Then 52 multiplied by something. Let's see, 52 * 3 =156. But how to get 3 from 54 and 74? 54/ (74- something). Not sure. Alternatively, 54 - (74-24) =54-50=4. Then 52 *4=208. Not 148.\n\nHmm. Let's try combining 74 and 54. 74 +54=128. Then I need 20 more. But the remaining numbers are 76 and24. 76-24=52. 128 +52=180. Not helpful. 76/24≈3.166. 128 +3.166≈131.166. Not.\n\nWhat if I subtract? 76*2=152. But how to get 2 from other numbers. 24/(54- something). Maybe 24/(74-54)=24/20=1.2. Then 76*1.2=91.2. Not helpful.\n\nWait, let's try multiplying two numbers and adding or subtracting. 76*2=152. If I can get 2 from 54 and 24 and 74. For example, 54/(74-24)=54/50=1.08. So 76*1.08=82.08. Then subtract the remaining number? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, 74*2=148. So if I can get 2 from the other numbers. Let's see. The remaining numbers are 76,24,54. How to make 2. For example, 54 - (76 -24) =54-52=2. Yes! So 54 - (76-24) = 54-52=2. Then multiply by 74: 74 *2=148. But wait, have I used all numbers? Let's check. 74 is used, 54,76,24. Yes. So the equation would be 74 * (54 - (76 -24)) = 148. Let's compute the inner part first: 76-24=52. Then 54-52=2. Then 74*2=148. That works! So the equation is (54 - (76 - 24)) *74 =148. But I need to arrange the numbers correctly and ensure each is used once. Let's verify:\n\nNumbers used: 54,76,24,74. All used once. Operations are subtraction and multiplication. Yes. That should work.\n</think>\n\n<answer>74 * (54 - (76 - 24)) = 148</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using the numbers 8, 17, 3, and 27 exactly once each, with basic operations, and the result should be 225. Hmm. Alright, where to start. \n\nFirst, maybe think about the target number 225. What's 225 divisible by? Let's see. 225 is 15 squared, so 15 times 15. But how does that help? Or maybe 25 times 9, which is 225. Or 27 times something? Wait, 27 is one of the numbers. 27 times 8 is 216, which is close but 9 less than 225. Hmm. If I have 27*8 = 216, then I need to add 9 to get to 225. Do I have the numbers left to make 9? Let's check. The remaining numbers would be 17 and 3. 17 minus 3 is 14, which isn't helpful. 17 plus 3 is 20. 17 divided by 3 is around 5.666. Not helpful. Maybe subtract them? 17-3=14. Doesn't make 9. So that might not work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe multiply 17 and 3 first. 17*3 is 51. Then if I use 27 and 8. Let's see. 27 plus 8 is 35. 35 times 51? That's way too big. 51*35=1785, way over. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe using division. If I have 27 divided by 3, that's 9. Then multiply by 25 to get 225. But how do I get 25 from 17 and 8? 17 +8 is 25. Oh! Wait, let's see:\n\n(27 / 3) * (17 + 8) = 9 * 25 = 225. Does that use all numbers once? Let's check. 27, 3, 17, 8—yes, each used once. And the operations are division and addition and multiplication. That seems to fit. So the equation would be (27 / 3) * (17 + 8). Let me calculate that again to be sure. 27 divided by 3 is 9. 17 plus 8 is 25. 9 multiplied by 25 is indeed 225. That works!\n\nWait, but let me see if there's another way, just to be thorough. Another approach could be to use subtraction or other operations. For example, 17 times 27 is 459. Then subtract something. But using 3 and 8. Maybe 459 - (3*8) = 459 -24=435, which is not 225. Not helpful. \n\nWhat about 27 times 8 plus something. 27*8=216, as before. Then adding 9. But as before, how to get 9 from 17 and 3. Not possible. Unless 17 - 8=9. Wait, but 8 is already used in the 27*8 part. Oh, right, you can't reuse numbers. So if I use 8 in 27*8, then 17 and 3 left. But 17 and 3 can't make 9 without using another number. So that approach doesn't work. \n\nAnother idea: 17*3=51. Then 51* (27-8)=51*19=969. That's way too big. No. \n\nHow about (27 - 17) * (8 * 3). 27-17 is 10. 8*3 is 24. 10*24=240. Close but not 225. \n\nWait, 225 is 15*15. Can I make two 15s? Let's see. Maybe (8 + 17) =25, which is not 15. 27-12=15. But how to get 12? 3*4=12, but I don't have a 4. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, 27 - (17 - 8) =27-9=18. Then 18* (3 + something). Not helpful. \n\nWait, perhaps using division and multiplication together. Let's think again about the first idea I had: (27 /3) * (17 +8). That uses all numbers, each once. And gives the correct result. Let me confirm once more:\n\n27 divided by 3 is 9. 17 plus 8 is 25. 9 multiplied by 25 is 225. Yep, that's correct. \n\nSo I think that's the solution. Let me just check if there's any other possible combinations, but this seems to be the right one. Another check: 27 /3=9, 17+8=25, 9*25=225. Perfect.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(27 / 3) * (17 + 8)</answer>"}]}

I need to use all the numbers 69, 5, 62, and 55 exactly once each, combining them with basic arithmetic operations to get 191. Hmm. Let me start by thinking about possible combinations.\n\nFirst, maybe I can look at the target number, 191, and see if I can break it down into parts that might relate to the given numbers. 191 is a prime number, but maybe that's not helpful. Let's see the numbers I have: 69, 5, 62, 55. They are all pretty close to multiples of 5 or 10 except 62 and 69. Wait, 69 is 70 minus 1, 62 is 60 plus 2, 55 is 11 times 5. Hmm.\n\nLet me try combining some of the larger numbers first. For example, 69 and 62. If I subtract them: 69 - 62 = 7. But 7 is small, and I need to get to 191. Alternatively, 69 + 62 = 131. Then maybe adding 55 would be 131 +55 = 186. Then adding 5 gives 191. Wait, that's 69 + 62 +55 +5 = 191. But wait, that's adding all of them, which would be 69+62 is 131, plus 55 is 186, plus 5 is 191. Oh! Wait, but that's using all the numbers with addition. But let me check: 69 + 62 + 55 +5. 69+62 is 131, plus 55 is 186, plus 5 is 191. Yes! But wait, does that use all numbers once each? Yes: 69,5,62,55. Wait, but 5 is there, but in the sum, it's 69 +62 +55 +5. So that's using all four numbers, each once, and the total is 191. Wait, that's actually correct. But why did the problem seem challenging then? Maybe I made a mistake in thinking it's difficult. Let me verify the arithmetic again.\n\nCalculating step by step:\n\n69 + 62 = 131\n\n131 + 55 = 186\n\n186 +5 = 191. \n\nYes, that's right. So the equation would be (69 + 62) + 55 +5 = 191, but since all operations are addition, parentheses aren't necessary. So maybe the answer is 69 + 62 + 55 +5 =191, but wait, the numbers given are 69,5,62,55. Wait, but adding all four numbers gives exactly 191. So the equation is simply 69 + 5 +62 +55 =191. But let me check: 69 +5 is 74, 74 +62 is 136, 136 +55 is 191. Yes. So the answer is 69 +5 +62 +55 =191. But why is this a problem? Maybe I'm missing something here. Wait, the problem says \"create an equation that equals 191. You can use basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) one or multiple times but each number can only be used once, and you must use all the numbers.\"\n\nWait, in that case, adding all numbers together works, but the problem might expect using operations more creatively, perhaps using multiplication or division. But maybe the simplest solution is just addition. Let me check again the sum:\n\n69 +5 =74; 74 +62=136; 136 +55=191. Yes. So that's correct. But maybe the user wants to see different operations, but according to the problem statement, as long as it uses all numbers once with any operations, addition is allowed. So the answer would be 69 + 5 +62 +55, which equals 191. So maybe the equation is (69 + 5) + (62 +55) = 191, but the parentheses aren't necessary. Alternatively, just 69 +5 +62 +55. Let me confirm once more:\n\n69 +5 =74\n\n74 +62 =136\n\n136 +55 =191. Correct. So that's the equation. But maybe the problem expects that you need to use different operations, but according to the instructions, addition is allowed. So perhaps the user didn't realize that adding all numbers would sum up to 191, but since it's possible, that's the solution.\n</think>\n\n<answer>69 + 5 + 62 + 55 = 191</answer>"}]}

The target is 509, which is already one of the numbers. So maybe I need to somehow use the other numbers to create an expression that equals 509, but since 509 is already present, perhaps I have to subtract or add something that cancels out. Wait, but the equation must use all the numbers. So the 509 must be part of the equation, but the result of the equation is 509. That means the other numbers (2, 56, 28) need to be manipulated in a way that when combined with 509, the result is 509. For example, maybe 509 plus something minus the same thing. Let's think.\n\nIf I do 509 + (something - something), but I need to use all the numbers. Let's see. The numbers left are 2, 56, and 28. Let me see if I can combine them to zero. For example, 56 - 28 is 28. Then 28 * something. Wait, 56 divided by 28 is 2. Then if I do 56 / 28 = 2. Then I have 2 and 2 left. But I already used 2 once. Wait, the original numbers are 2, 56, 509, 28. So if I use 56 / 28, that's using 56 and 28, leaving me with 2 and 2? Wait, no, the original numbers are 2, 56, 509, 28. So using 56 and 28 in division would leave me with 2. Then I have to use all numbers. So maybe 509 + (56 / 28 - 2) = 509 + (2 - 2) = 509. That uses all numbers: 509, 56, 28, and 2. Let me check: 56 divided by 28 is 2, subtract 2 gives 0, then add 509. That works. So the equation would be 509 + (56 / 28 - 2) = 509.\n\nBut let me write that out properly. Parentheses are important here. So (56 / 28) is 2, then subtract 2 gives 0. So adding that to 509 gives 509. Yes, that uses all numbers once each. Let me confirm the numbers used: 509, 56, 28, 2. All are used once. The operations are division, subtraction, and addition. That should work. Another way might be 509 + (56 - 28 - 2) but that would be 56 -28 is 28, minus 2 is 26, so 509 +26=535, which is not 509. So that doesn't work. Alternatively, 509 - (56 - 28)/2. Let's calculate that: 56-28=28, divided by 2 is 14. 509-14=495. Not 509. Hmm. What if I do 509 + (28 - 56)/2. That would be (28-56)= -28, divided by 2 is -14. 509 -14=495. Still not. Maybe multiplication? 509 * something. But that would be larger. Wait, but the target is 509. So maybe using division in a way that cancels out. Alternatively, 509 + (2*(56-28)). Let's see: 56-28=28, times 2 is 56. 509 +56=565. Not helpful. Maybe subtract: 509 - (2*(56-28)) =509 -56=453. Not helpful.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe combine 2 and 28 first. For example, 28 -2=26. Then 56 -26=30. 509 -30=479. Not helpful. Alternatively, 56 / (28 - 2). 28-2=26. 56/26≈2.153. Then 509 - that is about 506.846. Not useful. Maybe 56 * (28 /2). 28/2=14, 56*14=784. 509 +784=1293. No. Alternatively, 509 - (56 * (28 /2))=509 -784= -275. Not good.\n\nWait, let's go back to the first idea. 509 + (56 /28 -2). That works. Because 56 divided by 28 is 2, subtract 2 gives 0, so total is 509. Let me check again: 56 /28 =2; 2 -2=0. Then 509 +0=509. Yes. So the equation is 509 + (56 /28 -2). All numbers used once.

Let's check: 81 / 16.2 =5. So maybe if I can make 16.2 from 46, 23, and 30? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe subtract two numbers to get 5. For example, 30 - 25 =5.

So maybe another approach.\n\nLet me list all possible combinations. Maybe group numbers into two pairs, perform operations on each pair, then combine the results. For example, (30 and 46) and (81 and 23). Let's see: 30 +46=76, 81-23=58. Then 76 -58=18. Not 5. Hmm. Alternatively, 46 -30=16, 81-23=58. Then 58-16=42. No. What if I multiply and subtract. Like 46*30=1380, and 81*23=1863. Then 1863-1380=483. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, division. Let's think of fractions. Suppose 81 divided by something gives a larger number. Wait, maybe combining operations. For example, 46 - (81 / (30 -23)). Let's compute that: 30-23=7. 81/7≈11.57. Then 46 -11.57≈34.43. Not 5. Hmm.\n\nWait, what if I do 23 - (81 -46)/30. Let's calculate that: 81-46=35. 35/30≈1.1667. Then 23 -1.1667≈21.83. Not 5. No. What about (46 - (81 -30)) /23. Let's compute: 81-30=51. 46-51= -5. Then -5 /23≈-0.217. Not 5. But if I take absolute value, but the problem says only basic operations, so maybe not allowed. Alternatively, maybe reverse the order: ( (81 -30) -46 ) /23. 81-30=51. 51-46=5. Then 5 /23≈0.217. Not 5. Wait, but 5 is the numerator here. Wait, if I do ((81 -30) -46) *23. That would be 5*23=115. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 81 -46=35. Then 35 - (30 -23)=35-7=28. No. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe using division in a clever way. Let's think of 5 as 30 divided by 6. So 30 /6 =5. How to get 6 from 46,81,23. Let's see: 46 - (81 / something) =6. 81 divided by something would need to be 40. 81/40=2.025. So 46 - (81/2.025)=46-40=6. But how to get 2.025 from 23. That's not straightforward.

Let's compute: 81-23=58. 46-58= -12. Then 30 / (-12)= -2.5. Not 5. No.\n\nWait, maybe 81 divided by something. 81 divided by 16.2=5. How to get 16.2. Let's see 30 - (46 -23)=30 -23=7.

For example, if I can make the other three numbers somehow equal to zero, then 68 + 0 would work. Or maybe 68 multiplied by 1, but how to get 1 from 81, 3, and 27?\n\nLet's explore the zero idea first. If I can subtract or add zero to 68, that would leave it as 68. So using 81, 3, 27 to create zero. Let's see. For instance, 81 divided by something minus something else. Let's think: 27 divided by 3 is 9. Then 81 minus 9 is 72. Hmm, not zero. Alternatively, 3 times 27 is 81. So 81 - (3*27) equals 81 - 81, which is zero. Oh! Wait, that's a good point. If I have 3, 27, and 81, then 3 times 27 is 81, so 81 minus (3*27) equals zero. Then adding that to 68 would give 68 + 0 = 68. So putting that together: 68 + (81 - 3*27). Let's check: 3*27 is 81, 81-81 is 0, 68+0 is 68. That works! And all numbers are used: 68, 81, 3, 27. Each used exactly once. The operations are multiplication, subtraction, and addition.\n\nSo the equation would be 68 + (81 - 3 * 27). Let me verify the calculation again step by step. First, compute 3 * 27: that's 81. Then subtract that from 81: 81 - 81 = 0. Then add that to 68: 68 + 0 = 68. Exactly. So that's the correct equation. I think that's the solution. Let me just make sure there are no other possibilities, but this seems to fit perfectly.\n</think>\n\n<answer>68 + (81 - 3 * 27)</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using all the numbers 71, 89, 43, and 16 exactly once, and have it equal 430. The operations allowed are +, -, *, /. Hmm, let's start by thinking about what combinations could get close to 430.\n\nFirst, 430 is a relatively large number, so maybe multiplication would be involved here. Let's check the largest numbers: 71 and 89. If I multiply them, 71*89 is... let me calculate that. 70*90 is 6300, but 71*89 is (70+1)*(90-1) = 70*90 -70*1 +1*90 -1*1 = 6300 -70 +90 -1 = 6319. Wait, that's way too big, like 6319. That's way over 430. So maybe multiplication isn't the first step with those two.\n\nAlternatively, maybe adding some of the larger numbers first. 71 + 89 is 160. Then 43 +16 is 59. Hmm, 160 and 59. If I multiply them, 160*59=9440, which is way too big. If I subtract, 160-59=101. Still not close. Maybe not the right path.\n\nAnother approach: maybe using division to reduce one of the numbers. For example, if I can divide one of the larger numbers by a smaller one to get a useful intermediate. Let's see. 89 divided by 16 is about 5.5625. Then if I multiply that by 43, that's 5.5625*43 ≈ 239.1875. Adding 71 would get 310.1875. Not 430. Alternatively, 89 divided by 43 is about 2.069... Multiply by 16 would be around 33. Then 71+33=104. Still not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe if I take 71 and subtract something. 71 - (something) = part of the equation. Let's see. Maybe 43 and 16 can be combined. 43-16=27. Then 71 -27=44. Then 44*89=3916. No, that's way over. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, 43 +16=59. Then 89 -59=30. Then 71*30=2130. Still too high.\n\nWait, perhaps combining 71 and 43 first. 71+43=114. Then 89-16=73. 114 *73= 8322. No, too big. 114 +73=187. Not helpful.\n\nMaybe using a division to get a larger number. For instance, 430 divided by 71 is approximately 6.056. So maybe if I can make 6 from the other numbers. Let's see. 89,43,16. How? 89 - (43 +16)=89-59=30. Not 6. Alternatively, 89/(43-16)=89/27≈3.296. Not 6. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 430 is 71*6 + something. 71*6=426, so 426 +4=430. So perhaps can I get 4 from 89,43,16. Let's see: 43 - (89/16) → 89 divided by 16 is 5.5625, 43-5.5625≈37.4375. Not 4. Alternatively, 89-43=46, 46/16≈2.875. Not 4. Or 43 - (16) =27, 89-27=62. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 89*5 =445, which is 15 more than 430. But how to get 5? 16/(43-71). Wait, that would be negative. Hmm.\n\nWait, let's think about 430. 430 can be factored as 43*10. So if I can get 43*10, but I need to use all numbers. But 43 is already in the list. So maybe 43* (something) =430. Then the something would have to be 10. So how to get 10 from 71,89,16. Let's try: 89 -71=18. Then 18 -16=2. Not 10. Alternatively, 71 - (89-16)=71-73= -2. No. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, (71 +89) =160. Then 160 /16=10. Oh! Then 43*10=430. Wait, that works. Let me check: 43 * ( (71 + 89) / 16 ) = 43 * (160/16) =43*10=430. Yes! But let's confirm all numbers are used once: 43,71,89,16. Yes. All used. So the equation would be 43 * ((71 + 89) / 16) =430. Let me write that properly with parentheses.\n</think>\n\n<answer>43 * ((71 + 89) / 16) = 430</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using the numbers 15, 17, 17, 84, each exactly once, and the result should be 99. The operations allowed are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Hmm, how to approach this?\n\nFirst, maybe I should list out the numbers and think about possible combinations. The target is 99, which is close to 100, so maybe getting close to 100 and then adjusting. Let's look at the numbers: 84 is the largest, so perhaps that's a starting point. If I subtract something from 84, maybe? 84 minus what? 84 - 15 = 69, which is way too low. 84 - 17 = 67, still low. Adding 15 and 17 gives 32, but 84 +32 would be 116. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe combining the two 17s first. Since there are two 17s, maybe adding them: 17 +17=34. Then 84 -34=50. Then adding 15 gives 65. Nope. Hmm. Alternatively, 17*17=289. That's too big. Maybe 84 divided by 17? Let's see: 84 ÷17 is about 4.94. Not sure if that helps. If I take 84 divided by 17 and then multiply by 15? That's like 4.94*15≈74, which is still not 99. Not helpful.\n\nAnother angle: 15 and 84. 84 -15=69. Then 69 plus the two 17s: 69+17+17=103. Still not 99. Wait, 103 is 4 over. Maybe there's a way to subtract instead. Let's see: 84 -15=69. Then 17 -17=0. So 69 +0=69. No. Not helpful.\n\nWhat if I use multiplication? 17*15=255. Then 255 -84=171, which is way off. Then subtract the other 17: 171-17=154. No. Alternatively, 17*15=255. 255 divided by 84 is around 3. Still not.\n\nWait, maybe combine 84 and 15 first. 84 +15=99. Oh! Wait, that's the target. But then I need to use the two 17s. But if I do 84 +15=99, then how do I include the two 17s? Since each number must be used once, I can't just leave them out. So perhaps there's a way to make the two 17s cancel out or something. For example, 84 +15 + (17 -17). That would be 99 +0=99. But that uses all numbers: 15, 17,17,84. And the operations are addition and subtraction. Let me check: 84 +15 +17 -17. Yes, that equals 84 +15 + (17-17) = 99 +0=99. Wait, does that work? Each number is used once: 84,15,17,17. And all are used. The operations are +, +, -. So that's valid. So the equation would be 84 +15 +17 -17 =99. But does that meet the requirements? Let me check the rules again: each number can only be used once, and all must be used. Since 17 is used twice but in the original list there are two 17s. Wait, the problem states \"using the numbers 15, 17, 17, 84\". So we have two 17s. So each number here refers to each instance. So using each number once, so each 17 is considered a separate number. So in this equation, both 17s are used: one is added and the other is subtracted. So that's okay. Then that works. So 84 +15 +17 -17 =99. Let's verify: 84 +15 is 99, then 99 +17 is 116, then 116-17 is 99. Correct. So this equation uses all the numbers once, and the operations are allowed. So that's a possible solution.\n\nAlternatively, maybe another way. Let's see. For example, 84 + (17*17)/15. Let's check: 17*17=289. 289 divided by 15 is approximately 19.2667. 84 +19.2667≈103.2667. Not 99. Not helpful. Another idea: 84 - (17 +17)/15. Let's compute 17+17=34. 34/15≈2.2667. 84-2.2667≈81.73. Not 99. Hmm.\n\nWhat if we do 84 divided by something? Like 84/(17-17) +15. But 17-17=0, which would make division by zero, so that's invalid.\n\nAnother approach: 15 * something. Let's say 15*6=90, and 9 more. Maybe 15*6 +9=99. But where do 6 and 9 come from? Alternatively, 15* (something). Let's see. 15* (17 - (84/17)). Let's compute 84/17≈4.941. 17 -4.941≈12.059. 15*12.059≈180.88. Not 99.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 17 * (15 - (84/17)). Let's compute 84/17≈4.941. 15 -4.941≈10.059. 17*10.059≈171. Again, not 99.\n\nHmm. Let's think again. The first solution seems to work. 84+15+17-17=99. Let's check if that's allowed. The problem states each number can be used only once. But since there are two 17s, each one is used once. So using both 17s (adding one and subtracting the other) is acceptable. Therefore, that's a valid equation.\n</think>\n\n<answer>84 + 15 + 17 - 17 = 99</answer>"}]}

Let's look at the numbers given: 92 is the largest, then 73, 26, and 6. \n\nIf I subtract 73 from 92, that gives me 19. Not helpful. Adding them gives 92 + 73 = 165. That's higher than 145. Maybe 165 minus something. Let's see, 165 - 26 = 139, which is close. Then 139 - 6 = 133. Not quite. Alternatively, 165 - (26 + 6) = 165 - 32 = 133. Still not 145.\n\nWait, maybe combining 92 and 73 in a different way. What if I do 92 + (73 - something). Let's try 73 - 26 = 47. Then 92 + 47 = 139. Then subtract 6: 139 -6=133. Still no. Or maybe 73 - (26 /6) ? But 26 divided by 6 is about 4.333. Then 73 - 4.333 is around 68.666. Then 92 + that would be ~160.666. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, multiply. Let's see. If I multiply 26 and 6, that's 156. Then subtract 92? 156 -92=64. Then add 73? 64+73=137. Not 145. Hmm.\n\nWait, what if I do 73 * something. 73 * 2 is 146, which is very close to 145. How can I get 2 from the remaining numbers? 26 divided by something. 26 / (6 + something else). Wait, I have to use all numbers. So if I use 26 and 6 to make 2, then maybe 26 / (6 + 92 -73). Wait, but that's using multiple numbers. Let's see. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 73 * (6 - (26 / something)). Wait, not sure. Let's try different combinations. What if I take 26 and 6 first. 26 - 6 =20. Then 92 + 73 =165. 165 -20=145. Wait, that works! Let's check:\n\n92 +73 =165. Then 26 -6 =20. Then 165 -20 =145. But we have to use all numbers and each only once. So the equation would be (92 +73) - (26 -6). Let me compute that step by step: 92 +73=165; 26-6=20; 165-20=145. Yes! That uses all numbers once: 92,73,26,6. Each is used once, and operations are + and -, and parentheses. So the equation is (92 + 73) - (26 -6) =145.

Maybe I can break it down into factors or see how these numbers can relate to each other.\n\nFirst, let's list out the numbers: 3, 58, 87, 40. They are all different, so I need to use each one once. Let's think about possible combinations. Maybe subtraction or division could help bring down a larger number to 20.\n\nLooking at 87 and 40. If I subtract 40 from 87, that gives 47. Not helpful. What if I divide them? 87 divided by 40 is about 2.175. Hmm. Not directly helpful. Alternatively, 40 divided by 3 is about 13.333. Maybe combining that with other numbers.\n\nAlternatively, 58 and 40. 58 minus 40 is 18. Close to 20 but not there. If I add 3, that's 21. But then I have to use 87. Wait, but all numbers must be used. So maybe combining 87 and 3 somehow. Let's see, 87 divided by 3 is 29. Then if I subtract 29 from something else. Let's see: 58 minus 29 is 29, not 20. Or maybe 40 minus 29 is 11. Not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to create a fraction that results in 20. Let's see. For example, (something) divided by (something else) equals 20. Let's think: If I can make a numerator that's 20 times the denominator. For example, if the numerator is 60 and denominator is 3, that's 20. But 60 isn't directly available. Or 40 divided by 2 is 20. But 2 isn't one of the numbers. Alternatively, maybe combine numbers to get 80, then divide by 4. But 4 isn't here either.\n\nAlternatively, think of combining 87 and 58. Let's add them: 87 + 58 = 145. Then subtract 40: 145 - 40 = 105. Then divide by 3: 105 /3 =35. Not 20. Alternatively, subtract 3 first: 145 -3=142. 142 -40=102. Not helpful.\n\nHow about multiplying? 3 * 40 = 120. Then subtract 58: 120 -58=62. Then subtract 87? 62 -87= -25. Not 20. Maybe that's not the way.\n\nWait, maybe 87 - 58 =29. Then 29 - (40 / something). Let's see, 40 divided by something. If I use 3 here: 40 /3 ≈13.333. So 29 -13.333≈15.666. Not 20. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 58 - (87 / 3). Let's calculate that: 87 /3=29. 58-29=29. Then 29 +40=69. Not 20. No.\n\nWhat if I do 87 - (58 + 40). 58+40=98. 87-98= -11. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe 87 divided by something. Let's see. 87 divided by 3 is 29. Then 40 minus 29 is 11. Then 11 plus 58 is 69. Still no.\n\nAlternatively, 58 divided by something. 58 divided by 29 is 2. But where do I get 29? From 87/3. So 58/(87/3) =58/29=2. Then 2 * something. Let's say 2 *40=80. But that's not 20. Alternatively, 40 divided by 2=20. So if I can get 2, then 40/2=20. How?\n\nIf 58/(87/3) = 2, then 40 divided by that is 40/2=20. Let's check that. So the equation would be 40 / (58 / (87 /3)). Let's compute step by step: 87/3=29. Then 58/29=2. Then 40/2=20. Yes! That works. Let me verify:\n\n87 divided by 3 is 29. Then 58 divided by 29 is 2. Then 40 divided by 2 is 20. So using all numbers: 3, 87, 58, 40. Each used once. The operations are division and division again. So the equation is 40 / (58 / (87 /3 )). Which can be written as 40 / (58 ÷ (87 ÷ 3)).\n\nLet me check if there's another way. But this seems to work. Let me write it with parentheses properly. So 87 divided by 3 is in the denominator of 58, and then 40 divided by that result. So the equation is 40 ÷ (58 ÷ (87 ÷ 3)) = 20. Yes. That uses all numbers once. Let me confirm the calculation again:\n\nFirst, 87 ÷3 =29. Then 58 ÷29=2. Then 40 ÷2=20. Exactly. So the equation is 40/(58/(87/3)) =20. So that's the answer.\n</think>\n\n<answer>40 / (58 / (87 / 3))</answer>"}]}

Let's try adding them: 77 + 72 = 149. Then I have 149, and I still need to use 19 and 22. But 149 plus 19 is 168, and 168 plus 22 is 190. Wait, but that's adding all of them.

Let me make sure the numbers are all there. 77,72,19,22. Adding them all gives 190. So why didn't I think of that earlier? But wait, maybe the problem expects some operations other than just adding them all. Let me double-check the sum.\n\n77 +72 = 149. 149 +19 = 168. 168 +22 = 190. Yes, that's right. So the equation would be 77 +72 +19 +22 = 190. But wait, is that allowed? The problem says I can use operations one or multiple times. So addition is allowed. Each number is used once. So maybe that's the answer. But maybe the problem expects a combination of different operations. Let me check again the problem statement. It says \"using basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) one or multiple times but each number can only be used once, and you must use all the numbers.\" So adding all four numbers is acceptable. Wait, but let me check the sum again. 77 +72 is 149. 149 +19 is 168. 168 +22 is 190. Yes. So that works. So then why is this a problem? Maybe I'm overcomplicating. But maybe the problem is intended to require some operations other than just addition, but according to the problem statement, addition is allowed. Let me confirm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting parentheses or something else. For example, perhaps combining numbers in a different order. Let me see if there's another way. Suppose I try multiplying some numbers. For example, 77 - 72 =5. Then 5 * something. But 5*22=110, and 110 +19=129. Not 190. Alternatively, 72 - 22=50. 50 * something. 50*19=950. 950 divided by 77 is about 12.34. Not helpful. Hmm. Maybe 19*22=418. Then 77+72=149. 149 +418=567. No. Not close. Alternatively, 77* something. 77*2=154. But 72-22=50, 50 +19=69. 77*2.48=190. Not helpful. Alternatively, 22*(something). 22*8.63 is 190. How to get 8.63. Maybe 72-77= -5. Then 19 - (-5)=24. 24*22=528. No. Hmm. Let's try division. 77/22 is about 3.5. 3.5*19=66.5. 72+66.5=138.5. Not enough. Alternatively, 72/19=3.789. 77+3.789=80.789. 80.789*22≈1777. Not helpful.\n\nWait, but the straightforward sum works. So maybe the answer is 77 +72 +19 +22. But wait, when I add them all, it's 190. Let me check again. 77+72 is 149. 149+19 is 168. 168+22 is 190. Yes. So that's correct. So maybe the answer is just adding all four numbers. But maybe the problem is designed to trick people into thinking it requires more complex operations. But according to the problem's parameters, that's acceptable. So the equation is simply 77 +72 +19 +22 =190. So the answer is <answer>77 +72 +19 +22</answer>. But wait, the problem says \"create an equation that equals 190\". So the equation would be written with the numbers connected by operations. So the user might expect that, but perhaps in the example, they used parentheses. Wait, their example was (1 + 2) / 3. So in that case, maybe the answer is written as an expression without the equals sign, but the equation as an expression that evaluates to 190. So maybe just the left-hand side. So for example, 77 +72 +19 +22, which equals 190. So that's the correct answer. Hmm. Let me confirm again. 77+72=149, plus19=168, plus22=190. Yes. So the answer is simply the sum of all four numbers. Maybe I was overcomplicating it. But perhaps there's a mistake in my calculation. Let me check once again. 77+72: 70+70=140, 7+2=9, so 140+9=149. Then 149+19: 149+10=159, +9=168. Then 168+22: 160+20=180, 8+2=10, so 180+10=190. Correct. So that's the answer. I think that's it.\n</think>\n\n<answer>77 + 72 + 19 + 22</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using the numbers 55, 58, 908, and 46, each exactly once, with basic operations, and the result should be 859. Hmm. Let me start by writing down all the numbers and think about possible combinations.\n\nFirst, the target is 859. Let's look at the numbers I have. The largest number is 908. Maybe I can subtract something from 908 to get close to 859. Let's check: 908 minus what? 908 - 859 = 49. Do I have a 49? Not exactly, but I have 55, 58, 46. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe 908 minus some combination of the other numbers. Let's see. Let me try 908 minus (55 + 58 + 46). Wait, 55+58 is 113, plus 46 is 159. 908 - 159 is 749. That's way too low. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to multiply some numbers. Let's see. 58 times something? 58*15 is 870, which is close to 859. But 15 isn't directly available. Or 55*15 is 825, which is lower. Wait, 908 divided by something? 908 / 46 is approximately 19.73... Not sure if that's useful. Let's think differently.\n\nWhat if I use 908 - 46? That would be 862. Close to 859, but 862 - 3 = 859. But do I have a 3? Not directly. The remaining numbers are 55 and 58. Let me see. 55 - 58 = -3. Hmm. So maybe 908 - 46 + (55 - 58). Let's calculate that: 908 -46 is 862, then plus (55-58) which is -3. So 862 -3 = 859. Wait, that works! Let me check if I used all numbers. Yes: 908, 46, 55, 58. Each once. The operations are subtraction and addition. So the equation would be 908 - 46 + 55 - 58. Let me verify:\n\n908 -46 = 862\n\n862 +55 = 917\n\n917 -58 = 859. Yes! That works. But wait, the order of operations. Since it's all addition and subtraction, left to right. So yes, correct.\n\nAlternatively, can I write it with parentheses? Maybe (908 - 46) + (55 -58). But that's essentially the same as the left to right calculation. So the equation is 908 - 46 +55 -58 = 859. Let me just double-check:\n\n908 minus 46 is 862.\n\n862 plus 55 is 917.\n\n917 minus 58 is indeed 859. Perfect. So all numbers used once, correct operations. That's the solution.\n</think>\n\n<answer>908 - 46 + 55 - 58 = 859</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using the numbers 84, 21, 435, and 80 exactly once each, with basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) any number of times, and the result should be 755. Hmm, this seems a bit tricky. Let me start by thinking about how these numbers can combine to get close to 755.\n\nFirst, let's note that 755 is a relatively large number. The numbers we have are 84, 21, 435, and 80. The largest number here is 435, so maybe that's a starting point. If I can add or subtract other numbers to 435 to reach 755. Let's check: 755 - 435 = 320. So we need to get 320 from the remaining numbers 84, 21, and 80. Wait, 84, 21, and 80. Let's see. Maybe 80 multiplied by something. 80 * 4 = 320, but I don't have a 4. Alternatively, 84 + 80 = 164, which is way less than 320. Hmm. Maybe 84 * 4 = 336, but again, no 4. Alternatively, 84 * (21 + 80) would be 84*101=8484, which is way too big. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using division. Let's see. 84 divided by 21 is 4. Then 80 * 4 = 320. So 435 + (84 /21)*80. Let's compute that: 84 divided by 21 is 4, then 4 *80=320. 435 +320=755. That works! Wait, but does that use all numbers once? Let's check: 435 is used, 84 is divided by 21, so 84 and 21 are used, and 80 is multiplied. So all four numbers are used once each. So the equation would be 435 + (84 /21)*80 =755. Let me verify that calculation again. 84 divided by 21 is indeed 4, times 80 is 320. 435 plus 320 is 755. Perfect! So that seems to work. Let me just check if there's another way, but this seems straightforward. Let me try another approach to ensure I didn't miss anything.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 80 * 84 is a big number, 80*84=6720. But 6720 divided by 21 is 320. Then 320 +435=755. Wait, that's the same as before, just written differently. So 80*84/21 +435=755. Let's compute: 84/21 is 4, 80*4=320, plus 435=755. So that's another way to write the same equation. So either way, the key is using 84 divided by 21 to get 4, then multiplying by 80 to get 320, adding to 435. So both versions are valid. But since numbers have to be used once each, either way works. So the equation can be 435 + (84 /21) *80, or 80*(84/21) +435. Both are correct. So I can write either one. Let me just pick one. Let's go with 435 + (84 / 21) * 80. Yes, that's correct. So the equation is 435 + (84 ÷21) ×80 =755. All numbers are used once, and operations are basic arithmetic. So this should be the answer.\n</think>\n\n<answer>435 + (84 / 21) * 80 = 755</answer>"}]}

Hmm, let's start by thinking about how these numbers can combine. \n\nFirst, let's look at the target number 452. It's a bit over 450. Let me see which of the given numbers are close to that. 245 is a large number, maybe subtracting something from it? Or perhaps combining 100 and 50. Let's see.\n\nIf I add 100 and 50, that's 150. Then maybe multiply by something? 150 * 3 would be 450, which is close. But I don't have a 3. Wait, maybe there's another way. Let's see, 245 is a big number. If I subtract 245 from something else, but that might not get me close to 452. Alternatively, maybe I can add 245 and 57, which is 302. Then adding 100 and 50 would be 452. Wait, 245 + 57 is 302. Then 100 + 50 is 150. 302 + 150 is 452. Wait, that's exactly the target! Let me check: 245 + 57 = 302, 100 + 50 = 150. 302 + 150 = 452. But each number must be used once, and the operations should combine all into one equation. So perhaps (245 + 57) + (100 + 50) = 452. That uses all numbers once. Let me confirm: 245+57 is 302, 100+50 is 150. 302+150 is indeed 452. But wait, the problem says to use all numbers once and each number exactly once. So that works. Let me check if that's allowed. The equation would be (245 + 57) + (100 + 50) = 452. But since we can use operations multiple times, as long as each number is used once. Alternatively, maybe parentheses can be adjusted. But adding all four numbers together would be 245 + 57 + 100 +50 = 452. Let's compute that: 245 + 57 is 302, 100 +50 is 150. 302 +150 is 452. So the equation is 245 + 57 + 100 + 50 = 452. But wait, that's just adding all of them. But I thought maybe there's a trick. Wait, but 245 + 57 is 302, plus 100 is 402, plus 50 is 452. Yes, exactly. So the equation is 245 + 57 + 100 + 50 = 452. But let me check if that's correct. 245 + 57 = 302; 302 +100=402; 402 +50=452. Yes. So all numbers are used once with addition only. That works. But maybe the problem expects using different operations. Wait, the problem says \"using basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) one or multiple times\". So using only addition is allowed. Therefore, the equation is simply the sum of all four numbers. But wait, let me check the numbers again. Wait: 245 + 57 + 100 +50. Let me add them up step by step. 245 + 57 = 302. Then 302 + 100 = 402. Then 402 +50 = 452. Yes. So that's correct. Therefore, the equation is 245 + 57 + 100 + 50 = 452. But the problem might expect a more complex combination of operations. Maybe the user expects that, but according to the rules, addition is allowed. But let me verify again. The numbers are 100,50,245,57. If I add them all, that's 100+50+245+57. Let me compute: 100+50 is 150. 245+57 is 302. 150+302 is 452. Yes. So that's correct. Therefore, the simplest equation is adding all numbers. But maybe the user wants a different approach. Let me check again in case I made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe using multiplication or division to reach the target. Let's see. For example, 50 is half of 100. Maybe 50 * something. Let's think: 50 * 9 = 450. Then 450 + 2 =452. But I don't have a 9 or a 2. Alternatively, 245 divided by something. 245/5=49, but not sure. Wait, maybe 245 - 57 = 188. Then 188 + 100 +50 = 338. Not enough. Alternatively, 245 - (57 -50) = 245 -7=238. Then 238 +100=338. Still not. Hmm. Let's try 100 * 50 = 5000. That's way too big. 100 * 5 =500, but 5 isn't one of the numbers. Wait, maybe 245 - 57 = 188. Then 188 + 100 +50 = 338. No. How about 245 + 57 = 302. Then 302 + 100 +50=452. That's the same as before. So maybe that's the only way. But let me see another approach. Suppose we use multiplication. For example, 100 * 5 =500. But 5 is not here. Alternatively, 50 * 9 =450, but again, no 9. Alternatively, 57 * 8 = 456. Close to 452. 456 -4=452. But where to get 4? 50 -46=4. Not sure. Alternatively, 57 * (50/ (something)). Let's think. 57 * 8 is 456. 50 divided by 6.25 is 8. But we don't have 6.25. Alternatively, maybe 100 - (245 / 57) +50. Let's compute 245/57 is approximately 4.298. So 100 -4.298 is 95.702 +50=145.702. Not close. Hmm. How about 245 + 57 = 302. Then 100 +50=150. 302 +150=452. So that's the same as adding all numbers. Alternatively, 245 + (57 + 100) +50. Same result. So maybe that's the only way. Let me check the sum again: 245 +57 is 302. 100 +50 is 150. 302 +150 is 452. Exactly. So the equation is 245 +57 +100 +50=452. Therefore, the answer is just the sum of all four numbers. But the problem allows using operations multiple times, and each number once. So this should be acceptable. Therefore, the equation is (245 + 57) + (100 + 50) =452. Alternatively, written without parentheses as 245 + 57 + 100 + 50 =452. Either way, it's correct. So I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\n<answer>245 + 57 + 100 + 50 = 452</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using the numbers 8, 24, 19, and 8, each exactly once, with basic arithmetic operations to get 168. Hmm. Let me start by thinking about factors of 168. Since 168 is a multiple of 24, maybe 24 can be multiplied by something. Let's see, 24 times 7 is 168. But do I have a 7? Not directly. How can I get 7 from the remaining numbers: 8, 19, and another 8. Wait, 8 plus 8 is 16, and 19 minus 16 is 3. That doesn't help. Alternatively, 19 minus 8 is 11, and 11 minus 8 is 3. Still not 7.\n\nAlternatively, maybe subtract: 19 - 8 -8 = 3. Not helpful. What if I divide? 19 divided by something. 19 divided by (8/8) is 19, because 8/8 is 1. Then 24 * 19 is 456, which is way too big. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe instead of multiplying 24 first, combine other numbers. Let's see. If I use 8 and 8, maybe add them to get 16. Then 16 multiplied by something. 16 * 10.5 is 168, but how do I get 10.5? 19.5 minus 9? Not sure. Alternatively, 24 divided by something. 24 divided by (19 - 8 -8) is 24/3=8. Then 8*8=64. Not 168.\n\nWait, maybe 19 and 8. Let's see 19 +8=27. 27 multiplied by something. 27*6.222...=168. Not helpful. Alternatively, 19-8=11. 11*15.27... No. \n\nWait, maybe 24* (8 + (19-8))? Let's compute that: 19-8 is 11, then 8+11=19. 24*19=456. Still too big.\n\nAlternatively, 24*(8) =192. Then 192 - (19 +8)=192-27=165. Close but not 168. Hmm. What if I do 24*(8) + (19 -8)=192 +11=203. No.\n\nWait, maybe use division. If I have 24 divided by something. For example, 24/(8/8) =24/1=24. Then 24*19=456. Still no. Alternatively, (24/8)* (19+8)=3*27=81. Not 168.\n\nAnother angle: 168 divided by 24 is 7. So maybe if I can get 7 from the other numbers. The other numbers are 8, 19, 8. Let's see. 19 - 8 -8=3. Not 7. 8+8=16. 19-16=3. Still no. Maybe 19 - (8/8)=19-1=18. Then 24*18=432. Not helpful.\n\nWait, how about 8 * (19 - (24/8))? Let's compute inside the parentheses first: 24/8=3, then 19-3=16. Then 8*16=128. Not 168.\n\nHmm. Maybe combine 24 and 8 first. Like 24+8=32, but then I have 19 and 8 left. 32 * (19 -8)=32*11=352. No. Alternatively, 24-8=16. Then 16*(19 -8)=16*11=176. Closer, but still not 168. 176-8=168, but I already used the 8 in 24-8. Wait, no, because each number can only be used once. So if I do 24-8=16, then use 19 and 8, but the other 8 is already used. So that's not allowed.\n\nWait, maybe (24 - (8/8)) * something. 8/8 is 1, so 24-1=23. Then 23*7=161. Not helpful. Or 23* (19- something). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, 19*8=152. Then 152 + something=168. 168-152=16. So need 16 from 24 and 8. 24 -8=16. So 19*8 + (24 -8)=152+16=168. Wait, but that uses both 8s. Wait, the original numbers are 8,24,19,8. So there are two 8s. The problem says each number can be used once. So if there are two 8s, can I use each once? Let me check the problem statement again: \"using the numbers 8,24,19,8, create an equation... each number can only be used once, and you must use all the numbers.\" So the two 8s are separate numbers. So in that case, the equation would be (19 * 8) + (24 - 8) = 152 +16=168. Let me check: numbers used are 19,8,24,8. Each exactly once. Yes. So that works. So the equation is (19 * 8) + (24 - 8) = 168. Let me verify:\n\n19*8 is 152, 24-8 is 16, 152+16=168. Yes, that's correct. So the equation would be (19 * 8) + (24 - 8) = 168. But I need to make sure all numbers are used once. So 19, 8 (from the multiplication), 24, and the other 8 (from the subtraction). So each of the original numbers is used once. Perfect.

Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, 836 is a pretty large number. The numbers I have are 11, 35, another 11, and 52. Let me check the possible products because multiplication tends to give bigger numbers. Let's see:\n\nIf I multiply 35 and 52 first, that's 35*52. Let me calculate that. 35*50 is 1750, and 35*2 is 70, so total 1820. That's larger than 836. If I subtract something from that maybe? But then I have two 11s left. Alternatively, maybe I can divide somewhere.\n\nWait, 1820 divided by something? If I do 1820 / 11, that's 165.45... which isn't helpful. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe combining the two 11s. Since they are both 11, maybe adding them to get 22 or multiplying to get 121. Let's see:\n\nIf I multiply 11 by 11, that's 121. Then 121 times something... 121 * 7 is 847, which is close to 836 but not quite. 121*6.9... maybe not helpful. Alternatively, 52 divided by something. 52 divided by 11 is about 4.727. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 35 multiplied by 52 is 1820. Then, if I subtract the two 11s. Wait, but I can only use each number once. Oh right, I have to use all four numbers once. So 35, 52, and two 11s. Let me think of possible combinations.\n\nAnother approach: Let's list all possible pairs and operations. Maybe (35 * 52) - (11 * 11). Let me compute that. 35*52=1820, 11*11=121. 1820-121=1699. That's way more than 836. Not helpful.\n\nWhat if I do 35 * (52 - 11) - 11? Let's see: 52-11=41. 35*41=1435. Then 1435-11=1424. Still too big. Hmm.\n\nHow about 52 * (35 - 11) + 11? Let's check: 35-11=24. 52*24=1248. 1248 +11=1259. Still way over.\n\nMaybe division can help reduce the numbers. For example, 35 divided by 11 is about 3.18, but not sure. Let's see if combining division and multiplication. Maybe (52 / 11) * 35 + 11. Let's compute 52/11≈4.727. Multiply by 35: ≈165.45. Then add 11: ≈176.45. No, too small.\n\nAlternatively, (35 * 11) + (52 * 11). Let's calculate: 35*11=385, 52*11=572. 385+572=957. That's over by 121. Not helpful. But maybe subtract something? Wait, all numbers are already used here. Because 35, 11, 52, 11—all four numbers are used in that equation. So 385 + 572 = 957. But we need 836. The difference is 957 - 836 = 121. Hmm, which is 11*11. But I already used both 11s. So maybe that's not possible.\n\nWait, another idea: Maybe (35 + 52) * 11 + 11. Let's check: 35+52=87. 87*11=957. Then 957 +11=968. Still over.\n\nAlternatively, (35 + 52) * (11 + 11). That's 87 * 22 = 1914. No, way too big.\n\nWhat if I subtract instead? (35*52) - (11*11). Wait, that was 1820 - 121 = 1699. No. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, (52 - 35) * 11 * 11. 52-35=17. 17*11=187. 187*11=2057. That's way over.\n\nHmm. Maybe division can reduce some numbers. Let's think: 52 divided by 11 is about 4.727. Then 4.727 * 35 * 11. Wait, let's compute 52/11=4.727..., multiply by 35: 4.727*35≈165.45. Then 165.45*11≈1819.95. Close to 1820 again. Not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps 35 multiplied by 11 is 385. Then 385 * something. Let's see. If I have 385 * 2.17… but the numbers left are 52 and 11. How? Maybe 385 + (52 * 11). 52*11=572. 385+572=957, again. Not helpful.\n\nWait, 836 divided by 11 is 76. So if I can get 76 using 35, 52, and 11. Wait, 35 + 52 = 87. 87 - 11 = 76. So 76 * 11 = 836. But how to structure that. Let me see:\n\nSo (35 + 52 - 11) * 11. Let me check: 35+52=87. 87-11=76. 76*11=836. Yes! That works. Wait, but the numbers used are 35, 52, 11 (from 35+52-11), and then the other 11. So each number is used once: 35,52,11,11. Perfect. So the equation is (35 + 52 - 11) * 11 = 836. Let me verify:\n\n35 + 52 = 87. 87 - 11 = 76. 76 * 11 = 836. Exactly. That's the answer!\n</think>\n\n<answer>(35 + 52 - 11) * 11 = 836</answer>"}]}

Let me start by thinking about possible combinations.\n\nFirst, 80 is a multiple of 10, so maybe I can use 10 multiplied by something. Let's see, if I do 10 * 8 that's 80, but then I still have the two 7s left. Wait, but I have to use all numbers. So that approach alone doesn't work because I can't just ignore the 7s.\n\nHmm, maybe combine the 7s in some way. If I subtract them, 7 - 7 is 0, but adding that to 10*8 would still be 80. But does that count? Let's check: 10 * 8 + (7 - 7) = 80 + 0 = 80. But I'm allowed to use operations multiple times, so maybe that's valid. Wait, the problem says each number can only be used once, so using both 7s is okay because they are separate numbers. So maybe that's allowed. Let me verify the equation: 10 * 8 + 7 - 7. That uses all four numbers once each. Yes, that would work. But is there another way? Let me check if the problem allows such a straightforward approach, but maybe that's acceptable. Wait, but 10 * 8 is 80, and then adding and subtracting the same number (7) cancels out. So the equation would be 10 * 8 + 7 - 7 = 80. That uses all numbers once. Let me check the arithmetic: 10*8=80, 80+7=87, 87-7=80. Yep. So that works. But maybe the problem expects a different structure, but according to the rules, this should be valid. Alternatively, maybe using division or multiplication with the 7s. Let's see another possibility. For example, (10 + 7 - 7) * 8. That would be (10 + 0) *8 = 10*8=80. Again, that uses all numbers. So 10 +7 -7 gives 10, multiplied by 8. So (10 +7 -7)*8 = 80. That also works. So both these equations are valid. Are there other ways? Let me think. Maybe using division. For instance, 8 * 10 = 80, and then 7/7=1. So 8*10*(7/7)=80*1=80. That would be 8*10*(7/7)=80. That's another valid equation. All numbers used once. So multiple possibilities here. The problem allows any of these as long as all numbers are used once. So the answer could be any of these. Let me check if the problem requires a specific order or grouping. The example given is (1 + 2)/3, which uses parentheses. So maybe the answer needs parentheses where necessary. For example, the third option would require parentheses around 7/7. Let's see:\n\n8 * 10 * (7 / 7) = 80. That's correct. Alternatively, 10 * (8 + 7 -7) = 10*8=80. So that's another way. But maybe the first approach is simpler. Let me make sure all numbers are used. Each equation uses 10,8,7,7 once each. So any of these would work. The simplest one is probably 10 * 8 +7 -7. But maybe the problem expects the use of all numbers in a more involved way. Alternatively, combining 7 and 7 to make 14, but 14 isn't directly helpful. Wait, 8 * 10 =80, then 7/7=1, so 80 *1=80. So that's a clean way. So the equation would be (8 * 10) * (7 /7) =80. So all numbers are used once. So in that case, the equation would be 8*10*(7/7). Alternatively, with parentheses for clarity. So either of these is acceptable. Let me just check if all operations are allowed. The problem states basic arithmetic operations: +, -, *, /, which are all allowed. So any of these equations are valid. The user might accept any of these. Let me pick one. Let's go with (10 * 8) + (7 - 7) =80. But since 7-7 is zero, maybe the more efficient way is 10 *8 * (7/7). Because 7 divided by 7 is 1, so 80*1=80. That's another way. So which one to choose? Either is correct, but maybe the latter uses multiplication and division. Let me check both:\n\n1. 10 * 8 +7 -7 =80\n2. (10 +7 -7) *8=80\n3. 10 *8 * (7/7)=80\n\nAll of these are correct. The problem doesn't specify that numbers need to be in a certain order or that certain operations are preferred. So perhaps the most concise one is the third option: 10 * 8 * (7 /7). But I can check if there's any other possibility. Let me think again. For example, 10*(8 -7 +7). That would be 10*(8)=80. Wait, 8-7+7 is 8. So that's 10*8=80. So 10*(8 -7 +7) =80. That uses all numbers. So that's another valid equation. So maybe writing it as 10*(8 +7 -7). Which is the same as 10*(8). So again, uses all numbers. So there are multiple valid answers. The key is that each number is used exactly once. So the answer could be any of these. The user probably expects one such equation, and any correct one is acceptable. Let me pick one. Let's take the first one I thought of: 10*8 +7 -7=80. But since 7-7 is zero, maybe that's redundant. Alternatively, the one using division. Let me choose 10*8*(7/7). Let's check the calculation: 7 divided by7 is 1, then 10*8=80, 80*1=80. So that's correct. So the equation would be (10 * 8) * (7 /7) =80. So writing it with parentheses for clarity. Alternatively, 10*8*7/7. Since multiplication and division are left to right, that would be (10*8)*7 /7= 80*7 /7= 560/7=80. So that's also correct. So that equation is 10*8*7/7=80. This way, no parentheses are needed. Let me verify: 10*8 is 80, then multiplied by7 is 560, divided by7 is 80. Yes. So that's another way. So the equation can be written as 10*8*7/7=80. All numbers used once. So that's another valid form. So either of these is acceptable. So I think the answer could be one of these. Let me pick the one with division. So 10 multiplied by 8, then multiplied by 7 divided by7. So the equation is 10*8*7/7. That's acceptable. Let me check if that's valid. Yes: 10×8=80, 80×7=560, 560÷7=80. Correct. All numbers used once. So that's a valid equation. So this seems to meet all the criteria.\n</think>\n\n<answer>10*8*(7/7)=80</answer>"}]}

But I don't have a 9 here. Hmm. But maybe I can get a 9 somehow. Let's see. The numbers available are 24, 7, 48, 81. Let's check 81. 81 divided by 9 is 9, but I don't have a 9. Wait, maybe 81 divided by something else. Alternatively, 81 minus something?\n\nAlternatively, maybe use 48 and 24. 48 minus 24 is 24. Then 24 plus 7 is 31. Not helpful. Or 48 divided by 24 is 2. Then 2 times 7 is 14. Still not 63.\n\nWhat about 81 minus something? 81 minus 18 is 63. But how to get 18 from 24, 7, and 48. Let's see. 24 minus (48 / 8) would be 24 -6=18, but I don't have an 8. Wait, but 48 divided by 6 is 8. Wait, but how to get 6. Maybe 24 divided by 4? No, we don't have a 4. Alternatively, 7 - something? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think about 7 multiplied by something. 7 times 9 is 63. So if I can get a 9 from the other numbers. Let's see. 81 divided by 9 is 9. But how to get 9 from 24 and 48. Maybe 48 / (24 / something). Let's try 48 divided by (24 divided by 3). 24 divided by 3 is 8, so 48/8=6. Not 9. Hmm.\n\nWait, 81 is a number. 81 divided by 3 is 27. Maybe that's useful. How to get 3 from 24, 7, and 48. 24 - (7*3)=24-21=3? But that uses 7 again. Wait, can't reuse numbers. Hmm. Alternatively, (48 - 24) divided by something. 48-24=24. 24 divided by 8 is 3. But where's the 8? Maybe 48 divided by 6? Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe 81 - (48 / (24 / 7))? Let's calculate that. 24 divided by 7 is approximately 3.428. 48 divided by that is about 14. Then 81 -14=67. Not 63. Close but no.\n\nAnother approach: Let's see, 24 + 48 =72. 72 plus 7=79. 79 is too high. 72 minus 7=65. Still not. 81 minus 72=9. 9*7=63. Oh! Wait, that's an idea. If I can get 9 from 81 - (24 +48), then multiply by 7. Let's check that. 24 +48=72. 81 -72=9. Then 9*7=63. But that uses all the numbers: 24, 48, 81, and 7. Yes! So the equation would be (81 - (24 + 48)) * 7 = 63. Let me check the arithmetic: 24+48=72. 81-72=9. 9*7=63. Perfect. But wait, is that allowed? Because the operations are allowed. Let's see: the numbers are used once each, and all are used. Yes. So that works. The equation would be (81 - (24 + 48)) * 7 = 63. Let me write that as (81 - 24 - 48) * 7. Either way, same result. So that's the solution.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(81 - 24 - 48) * 7 = 63</answer>"}]}

Let me start by thinking about the target number. 582 is a bit large, so maybe multiplication will be involved here. Let's check what 97 times something could get close. 97*6 is 582 exactly! Oh, wait, so if I can get 6 from the other numbers, then 97*6=582. But the remaining numbers are 1, 41, 47. How can I get 6 from those? Let me see. 41 and 47, maybe subtracting. 47 - 41 is 6. Then add the 1? Wait, but if I do (47 - 41) that's 6, and then if I add 1, that would be 7. But that's too much. Alternatively, maybe subtract the 1. 47 - 41 -1 would be 5. Hmm.

Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the 1 can be used in a division. Let's think. If I have 41 and 47, maybe subtracting them gives 6, then multiplied by 97 gives 582. Then where does the 1 fit? Since we have to use all numbers, but in that case, we have 97*(47-41) = 582, but that uses 97, 47, 41, leaving out the 1. So we need to include the 1 somehow. Maybe 97*( (47 -41) +1 )?

Maybe combining them with multiplication. 97*41 is 3977, which is way too big. 97*47=4559. Also way too big. 41*47=1927. Hmm. So maybe that's not the way. Let's try adding. 97 + 41 +47 +1= 97+41=138, 138+47=185, +1=186. Not even close. Maybe subtract. 97*41 -47*1= 3977 -47=3930. Nope. Alternatively, 97*47 -41 -1= 4559-42=4517. Not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps using division. Let's see. For example, 47 - (41 / 1) = 6. Then 97 * 6 =582. Wait, that uses all numbers. Let me check: 47 - (41 /1) =47 -41=6. Then 97*6=582. But does that use all the numbers? Let me list them: 97, 47, 41, 1. Yes, all are used. The operations are division (for 41/1), subtraction (47 - that result), and multiplication.

No.\n\nHow about 18*(30 - (20/ something)). Let's see. 20 divided by 9≈2.222. 30-2.222≈27.777. 18*27.777≈500. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe 30*(18/ (20 -9)). 20-9=11. 18/11≈1.636. 30*1.636≈49.09. No.\n\nAlternatively, 30 + 18 + 20 +9=77. Not 108. So adding all doesn't help.\n\nWait, maybe (30 * 18) / (20 -9). 30*18=540. 20-9=11. 540/11≈49.09. Nope.\n\nHmm, maybe division somewhere. Let's think of 108 as 9*12. How to get 12 from 30,20,18. Let's see: 30 - (20 - (18/ something)). Wait, 18 divided by 1.5 is 12. But 1.5 is 3/2. So maybe (30 -20) * (18/ something). 30-20=10. 10*(18/1.5)=10*12=120. But how to get 1.5 from the numbers? Wait, 9/6=1.5, but 6 isn't present. Alternatively, 9/(20 -18)=9/2=4.5. So 10* (18/4.5)=10*4=40. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 18/( (30/ something) -20). Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe (30 + 18) * (20 -9). 48 *11=528. Not 108.\n\nAlternatively, 20*(30/(18-9)). 18-9=9. 30/9≈3.333. 20*3.333≈66.666. No.\n\nWait, 108 divided by 9 is 12. So if I can get 12 from 30,20,18. Let's think: 30 - (20 - (18/ something)). Wait, 18 divided by 1.5 is 12. But 1.5 is 3/2. If I can get 3/2 from the remaining numbers. Wait, 30/(20) = 1.5. So 18/(30/20) =18*(20/30)=12. Then 9*12=108. So putting it together: 9 * (18 / (30 /20)) = 9 * ( (18 *20)/30 ) =9*(360/30)=9*12=108. Let me check the numbers: 9, 18, 30,20. All used once. Operations: division and multiplication. So the equation would be 9 * (18 / (30 /20)) =108. Let me compute step by step: 30 divided by20 is 1.5. Then 18 divided by1.5 is12. Then 9*12=108. Yes, that works. So the equation is 9 * (18 / (30 / 20)) =108. Let me write that with parentheses properly: 9 * (18 / (30 / 20)).\n</think>\n\n<answer>9 * (18 / (30 / 20))</answer>"}]}

Hmm. Let's start by thinking about the target number, 251. It's a prime number, so maybe subtraction or addition could get there. Let me try different combinations.\n\nFirst, maybe if I can get close to 250 and then add or subtract something. 54 is the largest number here. If I multiply 54 by something. Let's see: 54*5 is 270, which is too big. But 54*4 would be 216, which is lower. Maybe 54*5 - something, but I don't have a 5. Wait, I have 25 and 10. Maybe 25 divided by 5 is 5, but 25 isn't 5. Alternatively, 25 is 25. Let me think.\n\nWhat if I do 54*5? Wait, 54*5 is 270, but how do I get 5 from the remaining numbers? 25 divided by 5 is 5, but I only have 10, 25, 33 left. Wait, 10 divided by 2 is 5, but I don't have a 2. Maybe 25 minus 10 is 15. Hmm, not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe subtract something from 54. Like 54*5 - (33 + something). Wait, but how to get 5. Maybe 25 - 10 = 15. So 54*5 - 15 = 270 -15=255. Not 251. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I can use 33 in some way. 54 + 33 is 87. 87 * something. 87*3 is 261. Maybe 261 - 10? That would be 251. But how do I get 3? 25 divided by something? 25 divided by (something) is 3. But 25 isn't divisible by 3. Alternatively, 10 divided by something. 10/ (25/ something). Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe 54* (25 - something) + 33 - 10. Let's try. 25 -10=15. 54*15=810. 810 +33=843. That's way too big. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 25*10=250. Oh, that's 250. Then 250 plus 1 is 251. But how to get 1 from 33 and 54. 54 -33=21. Not 1. 54 divided by 33 is like 1.636, not an integer. Hmm. Wait, 54 - (33 + 25 +10) = 54 -68= -14. Not helpful.\n\nWait, 25*10=250. Then 250 + (54 -33) = 250 +21=271. That's not 251. Or 250 + (54 -33) - something, but I already used all numbers. Wait, maybe 25*10 + (54/33). But 54/33 is 1.636, so 250 +1.636≈251.636. Close, but not exact and not using integers properly.\n\nAlternatively, 33*10=330. 330 - (54 +25) = 330 -79=251. Wait, let's check: 33*10 is 330. Then subtract 54 and 25, which are 79. 330 -79=251. Yes! That works. So the equation would be 33*10 -54 -25. But wait, let me check if all numbers are used once: 33,10,54,25. Yes, all used. Let's compute: 33*10 is 330. Then subtract 54 gives 276. Subtract 25 gives 251. Exactly the target. So the equation is (33*10) -54 -25 =251. Alternatively, written as 33*10 -54 -25. But parentheses might not be needed, but to make it clear.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, you can use each number once. So in this case, 33,10,54,25 are all used. Yes. So that works. Let me verify again. 33*10=330. 330-54=276. 276-25=251. Yep. So the equation is 33*10 -54 -25=251. So that's the answer.\n</think>\n\n<answer>33*10 - 54 - 25 = 251</answer>"}]}

All numbers must be used once with basic operations. Hmm. Let's start by thinking about possible combinations.\n\nFirst, 50 and 25 are both multiples of 25, which might be helpful. Maybe subtracting 25 from 50 gives 25, but then how to involve 59 and 9? Alternatively, adding 50 and 25 gives 75. Wait, 50 +25 is 75. That's exactly the target. But then I still need to use 59 and 9 somehow. Since all numbers must be used, I need to incorporate them into the equation in a way that doesn't change the result. Maybe using them in a division or multiplication that cancels out?\n\nFor example, if I do (50 +25) * (something with 59 and 9) / (something else). But that seems complicated. Let's try another angle. Let's see if 59 can be used in a subtraction. 59 minus something equals 75? That would require the something to be negative, but maybe combining other numbers.\n\nWait, maybe (59 + something) * or / other numbers. Let me try combinations. For instance, 50 + 25 =75, so maybe 50 +25 + (9 -59)? No, that would be 75 -50=25. Not helpful. Alternatively, 59 -9 =50, then 50 +25=75. But that would use 59,9,50,25: 59-9=50, then 50+25=75. So the equation would be (59 -9) +25 =75. Wait, but that uses all four numbers: 59,9,25. Wait no, (59-9) is 50, plus 25 is 75. But where does 50 come into play? Wait the original numbers include 50. So if I use 59-9, that's 50, then adding 25 gives 75. But the original 50 isn't used here. Because I used 59 and 9 to make 50. So the problem requires using each original number once. So 50 is a given number. So I can't use 59-9 to make 50, because that would use 59 and 9, and then I have the original 50 unused. So that approach is invalid.\n\nSo need to use all four numbers: 59,9,25,50. Let's think of other operations. Maybe multiplication and division. Let's see: 50 * something. 50*(something) =75. So that something would be 1.5. How can I get 1.5 from 59,9,25? Maybe (25/(59-9))? 59-9=50, 25/50=0.5. Then 50*0.5=25. Not 75. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 50 + (something). Let's see. 50 +25=75, but then 59 and 9 left. Maybe 50 +25 + (9-59). But that's 75 + (-50)=25, which is not 75. Not good. Or 50 + (25 - (59/9)). Let's calculate 59/9 is approximately 6.555... So 25-6.555 is about 18.444, so total would be 50 +18.444=68.444, not 75.\n\nHmm. What about subtraction. 59 - (something) =75. That would require the something to be negative. So 59 - ( -16 ) =75. How to get -16 from 9,25,50? Not sure. Alternatively, 59 + something =75. Then something is 16. Can I make 16 from 9,25,50? 25 -9=16. Then 59 + (25-9) =75. That uses 59,25,9, and then where does 50 come in? Oh, wait, we need to use all four numbers. So that's a problem. So in that case, 59 + (25 -9) =75, but 50 is left unused. So that doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using multiplication. 9 * something =75. Then something is 75/9 ≈8.333. Not sure. 50 -25=25. 25/ something. Wait, maybe (50 -25) * (59 -9) / something. Wait, but all numbers need to be used once. Let me try another approach.\n\nLet's list all possible operations between pairs and see. For example:\n\n50 -25 =25. Then 25 *3=75. But where to get 3 from 59 and9? 59/9 is about 6.55. Not helpful. 9- (59/25) ≈9-2.36=6.64. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 59 -50=9. Then 9 + (25* something). Wait, but 59 is already used here. Maybe:\n\n25 *3=75. How to get 3 from 9,50,59. Maybe (59 -50) =9, then 9 /3=3. But again, numbers are used multiple times. Not allowed.\n\nWait, perhaps 50 +25=75. Then how to involve 59 and9. Maybe 50 +25 + (9 -59). But that gives 75 -50=25. Not helpful. Alternatively, multiply or divide by 59 and9. For example, (50 +25) * (9/59). But that would be 75 * (9/59) ≈11.44, not 75.\n\nAlternatively, (50 +25) + (59 -9). That's 75 +50=125. No. Or (50 +25) - (59 -9)=75 -50=25. Not helpful.\n\nHmm. Maybe using division in a clever way. Let's think: 59 - (50/25) +9. Let's calculate: 50/25=2, so 59-2=57, 57+9=66. Not 75.\n\nAlternatively, 50 * (9/(59-25)). 59-25=34. 9/34≈0.2647. 50*0.2647≈13.23. Not 75.\n\nWait, 59 - (9 +25) =59-34=25. Then 25 +50=75. So the equation would be (59 - (9 +25)) +50=75. Let's check: 9+25=34. 59-34=25. 25+50=75. Yes! But does that use all numbers once? Let's see: 59,9,25,50. Yes, each is used once. So the equation is (59 - (9 +25)) +50 =75. Or written as 50 + (59 - (9 +25))=75. Let me check the arithmetic:\n\n59 minus (9+25) is 59-34=25. Then 50 +25=75. Correct. So that works. So the equation is 50 +59 -9 -25=75. Because 50+59=109, minus9=100, minus25=75. Wait, but that's adding and subtracting. Let me verify:\n\n50 +59 =109\n\n109 -9=100\n\n100 -25=75.\n\nYes. So 50 +59 -9 -25=75. That uses all numbers once, each operation is allowed. So that's a possible solution.\n\nAnother way to write it is (50 +59) - (9 +25)=75. Because 50+59=109, 9+25=34, 109-34=75. That also works. So the equation can be structured as (50 +59) - (9 +25)=75.\n\nYes, that seems to satisfy all conditions. Let me check again:\n\nUsed numbers: 50,59,9,25. All used once. Operations: + and -, each allowed. The result is 75. Correct.\n\nSo the answer is (50 +59) - (9 +25)=75. So inside the answer tags, that would be <answer>(50 + 59) - (9 + 25)</answer>.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(50 + 59) - (9 + 25)</answer>"}]}

All numbers must be used exactly once, and I can use basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division. Hmm.\n\nFirst, maybe I should look for ways to combine these numbers to get smaller numbers first. Since 1 is a small target, division might be helpful here. Let's think about possible fractions that could result in 1. For example, if I can make a fraction where the numerator and denominator are the same, but using the numbers somehow. But the numbers given are all different, so that might not work directly.\n\nLet me list out the numbers again: 39, 37, 7, 69. Let's see if any of these numbers are multiples or factors of each other. 69 divided by 3 is 23, but 3 isn't in the list. Wait, 39 is 13×3, 37 is prime, 7 is prime, 69 is 23×3. Not sure if that helps immediately.\n\nWhat if I try to subtract some numbers first. For example, 39 - 37 = 2. Then I have 2, 7, 69 left. But 2 and 7 could be combined. Maybe 7 - 2 = 5, then 69 and 5... Not sure. Or 69 divided by something. 69 divided by 5 is 13.8, which isn't helpful. Alternatively, maybe 69 - 5 = 64, but I don't see a path to 1 here.\n\nAlternatively, starting with division. Let's see: 69 divided by 39 is approximately 1.769. Hmm, not helpful. 39 divided by 7 is around 5.57. 37 divided by 7 is about 5.285. 69 divided by 7 is around 9.857. Maybe combining divisions and subtractions.\n\nWait, perhaps (69 - 39) = 30. Then I have 30, 37, 7 left. 37 - 30 = 7. Then 7 divided by 7 is 1. Oh! Wait, but that would use 7 twice. But each number can only be used once. So that's not allowed. Because 7 is already used once in the (37 - 30) part, but the 30 comes from 69 - 39, which uses 69 and 39. Then the remaining numbers are 37 and 7. Wait, no: if I subtract 39 from 69 to get 30, then I have 30, 37, 7 left. Then subtracting 30 from 37 gives 7, and then dividing 7 by 7 gives 1. But that uses 7 twice. The original numbers are 39,37,7,69. So in this case, the 7 is already part of the numbers, so if I do 7 divided by 7, that's using the same number twice. Which isn't allowed. So that approach doesn't work.\n\nAnother idea: maybe combine 39 and 37. Let's see, 39 + 37 = 76. Then I have 76, 7, 69. Hmm. 76 - 69 = 7. Then 7 / 7 = 1. But again, same problem as before: using 7 twice. So that's not allowed.\n\nWait, maybe I can use multiplication and division. Let's see: 69 divided by something. 69 divided by 23 is 3, but 23 isn't in the numbers. How about 39 divided by 13 is 3, but 13 isn't there either. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, 7 times something. Let's see: 7 times 10 is 70. If I can get 70, maybe. But with the other numbers. Let's see. 37 minus 39 is -2. Then 69 minus (-2) is 71. Not helpful. Alternatively, 37 + 39 = 76. 76 minus 69 is 7. Then 7 divided by 7 is 1. Again, same issue with using 7 twice.\n\nWait, maybe there's a way to combine division and subtraction. Let's think: For example, (something divided by something) minus (something divided by something) equals 1. But since we have to use all four numbers, maybe arrange them into two fractions and subtract them. Let's see. Suppose (39/7) - (something) = 1. But 39 divided by 7 is about 5.57. So 5.57 - x =1, so x=4.57. How to get 4.57 from 37 and 69? Maybe 37 divided by 69 is approximately 0.536. So 5.57 - 0.536 is about 5.03, not 1. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (69/37) - (39/7) = ? Let's calculate: 69/37 ≈1.864, 39/7≈5.571, so 1.864 -5.571≈-3.707. Not helpful.\n\nWhat if we do 69 divided by (something) and then subtract something else. For example, 69 divided by 69 is 1, but then we have to use 39,37,7. Not possible. Alternatively, 39 divided by 39 is 1, same issue.\n\nAlternatively, maybe ((69 - 39) / (37 - 7)) = (30)/(30) =1. Wait, 69 minus 39 is 30. Then 37 minus 7 is 30. So 30 divided by 30 is 1. That uses all four numbers: 69,39,37,7. Each used once. And the operations are subtraction and division. Let me check:\n\n(69 - 39) is 30.\n\n(37 - 7) is 30.\n\nSo 30 / 30 =1. That works! So the equation would be (69 - 39) / (37 - 7) =1.\n\nWait, let me confirm the numbers: 69,39,37,7. All used once. Subtraction used twice, division once. Yes, that should work. So the equation is ((69 - 39) / (37 - 7)) =1. That's the answer. Let me just check the arithmetic again.\n\n69 -39=30.\n\n37-7=30.\n\n30/30=1. Yes, correct.

I need to create an equation using the numbers 36, 83, 212, and 99 exactly once each, with basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) any number of times, to get 666. Hmm. Alright, where do I start?\n\nFirst, maybe I should think about the target number 666. Let's break it down. 666 is a multiple of 6 (since 6*111=666). So perhaps using 36, which is 6 squared, could be useful. Maybe 36 multiplied by something?\n\nLet me check what 36 multiplied by different numbers would give. For example, 36*18=648, which is close to 666. 648 is 18 less than 666. But then maybe adding 18? But I don't have 18. Alternatively, maybe 36*19=684, which is 18 more than 666. But again, not sure how to get that.\n\nWait, maybe using another approach. Let's look at the other numbers. 212 is a large number. If I subtract 212 from something, or add it... Let's see. 212 plus 99 is 311. 83 plus 36 is 119. Not helpful. Maybe 212 multiplied by something? Let's see: 212*3=636, which is 30 less than 666. Hmm, 212*3 + 30 = 666. But where would I get 30 from? 99-36=63, 83-36=47, not 30. Alternatively, 212*2=424. 424 plus 242=666, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe combining 212 with 83. Let's see: 212 +83=295. Then 295 + something. 666-295=371. Not helpful. Maybe subtract: 212-83=129. 129 + ? Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe multiplication of two numbers. Let's see the numbers: 36, 83, 212, 99. The largest product would be 212*99, which is 212*100=21200 minus 212=21200-212=20988. That's way too big. 212*83= 212*80=16960 plus 212*3=636, total 16960+636=17596. Still too big. 83*99=8217. Hmm. 36*212=7632. All way too large. So maybe multiplication isn't the way to go unless combined with division or subtraction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using division to reduce some numbers. For example, 212 divided by something. 212/36 is roughly 5.89. 212/83 is about 2.554. 212/99 is around 2.14. Not sure. Or 99 divided by 36 is 2.75. Maybe those fractions can be parts.\n\nAlternatively, combining addition and multiplication. Let's think of possible combinations.\n\nLet me try to pair numbers. Let's say we use 212 and 36. If I do 212 - 36 = 176. Then how to get 666 with 176, 83, and 99? Not sure. 176 +83=259. 259 +99=358. No. 176*83=14568. That's way too big. Maybe 176* (83 - 99). Wait, but we can't reuse numbers. Hmm.\n\nAnother approach: maybe find two numbers that can combine to a value, and another two numbers that combine to another value, then those two results combine to 666. For example, (36 * 83) + (212 - 99). Let's check: 36*83=2988. 212-99=113. 2988+113=3101, which is way over. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, (212 - 83) = 129. Then 129 * something. 129*5=645. 645 +21=666. But how to get 5 and 21 from remaining numbers? 99 and 36. Let's see: 99/36=2.75. Hmm. Maybe 99 - (36/ something). Not sure.\n\nWait, 212 divided by something. 212/ (some combination). Let's think: 212/(99-83) = 212/16=13.25. Then 13.25*36=477. 477 is less than 666. Not helpful. Alternatively, 212/(83-36)=212/47≈4.51. 4.51*99≈446.5. Still not enough.\n\nAlternatively, 36*(83 - (212/99)). Let's compute 212/99≈2.14. 83-2.14≈80.86. 36*80.86≈2910.9. Way over.\n\nHmm. Maybe using subtraction and addition. Let's think 666 = a + b where a and b are combinations. For example, 212*3=636. Then 636 +30=666. How to get 30 from 83, 99, 36. Maybe 99 - (83 -36)=99-47=52. Not 30. Or 83 - (99/36)=83-2.75=80.25. No. Alternatively, 36 - (99 -83)=36 -16=20. Then 20 + something. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe 212*3=636. Then 636 +30=666. So 3*212=636. Now, how to get 30 from 36,83,99. If we can use 36 and 99 and 83 to make 30. Let's see: 99 -83=16. Then 36 -16=20. Not 30. Alternatively, 83 - (99 -36)=83 -63=20. Still not. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, 212*3=636. 3 comes from where? Maybe 99/33=3, but 33 is not available. Wait, 36/12=3. But 12 isn't there. Alternatively, 83-80=3, but that uses 83. But 83 is part of the numbers. Wait, if we do 83 - (36 + something) to get 3. Let's see: 83 - (36 + x)=3. Then x=44. But we don't have 44. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, 99 divided by 33=3. But we don't have 33. Maybe 99 divided by something else. 99/36=2.75. Not 3. So this approach might not work.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe using 212 and 83 to make a larger number. 212 +83=295. 295*2=590. 590 +76=666. But how to get 76 from 36 and 99? 99-36=63. 63+13=76. Where does 13 come from? Not possible.\n\nAlternatively, 212*2=424. Then 424 + something. 666-424=242. How to get 242 from 83, 36, 99. 83*3=249, which is close. But how? 83*3=249. 249 - (99/36). 99/36=2.75. 249-2.75=246.25. Not 242. Not helpful.\n\nHmm. Maybe combining division and multiplication. For instance, 99 divided by 36 is 2.75. Then 2.75*212=2.75*200=550 +2.75*12=33, so total 583. Then 583 +83=666. Wait, that works! Let me check:\n\n99 / 36 = 2.75\n\n2.75 * 212 = 2.75 * 200 + 2.75 * 12 = 550 + 33 = 583\n\n583 + 83 = 666\n\nBut hold on, have I used all numbers? Let's see: 99, 36, 212, and 83. Yes, all used once. So the equation would be (99 / 36) * 212 + 83 = 666.\n\nWait, let me calculate that exactly. 99 divided by 36 is exactly 2.75. 2.75 times 212 is (11/4)*212 = (11*212)/4. 212/4=53, 53*11=583. Then 583 +83=666. Exactly. So that works.\n\nSo the equation is (99 / 36) * 212 + 83 = 666. Let me verify each number is used once: 99, 36, 212, 83. Yes. All operations are division, multiplication, addition. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is ((99 / 36) * 212) + 83 = 666.\n</think>\n\n<answer>((99 / 36) * 212) + 83 = 666</answer>"}]}

Let's start by looking at the numbers: 378 is the biggest, then 80, then 42, then 21. \n\nFirst thought: Maybe subtract something from 378 to get closer. But 741 is bigger than 378, so subtraction might not help here. Alternatively, adding 378 and 80 gives 458, which is still way below 741. Then maybe multiply some numbers. Let's see. If I multiply 80 by something. Let's check 80*42=3360, that's way too big. 80*21=1680. Still too big. 378*80=30240, way too large.\n\nWait, perhaps using division. Let's think. If I take 378 divided by something. 378/21 is 18. Then 18 + 80 + 42? 18+80=98, +42=140. Nope. Not close. \n\nAlternatively, 42 divided by 21 is 2. Then 378 + 80 +2 =460. Still no.

How to get 2 from the remaining numbers. 42 divided by 21 is 2. Then 378*(42/21) = 378*2=756. Then 756 -80=676. That's not it. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, 378 + (80 * something). Let's compute 741-378=363. So I need 80 combined with 21 and 42 to make 363. Let's see. 80*4.5=360, which is close. How to get 4.5 from 21 and 42. 42/21=2. Hmm, not 4.5. Wait, 42 +21=63. 63/80=0.7875. Not helpful. Alternatively, 80*(42-21)=80*21=1680. Not helpful.\n\nAnother approach: 80* (42/21) =80*2=160. 378+160=538. Then 538+something=741. 741-538=203. But we've already used 378,80,42,21. Wait, no, if I used 378,80,42,21, then all numbers are used. Wait, but in this case, 378 + (80*(42/21)) uses all four numbers. Let's check: 378 + (80*(42/21)) = 378 + (80*2) = 378+160=538. But 538 is not 741. So that doesn't work.\n\nWait, maybe using subtraction. Let's think. 80 - 21=59. Then 59* something. 59*12=708, which is close to 741. How to get 12 from 378 and 42. 378/42=9. So 59*9=531. Not helpful. Alternatively, 42/ (378/ something). Maybe 378 divided by 42 is 9. Then 9*59=531. Still not.\n\nHmm. Let's try different combinations. Maybe multiply two numbers and add another. For example, 80*42=3360. Then 3360 - 378=2982. Then 2982/21=142. Not close. Alternatively, 378*21=7938. 7938 -80=7858. Then 7858/42≈187. Not helpful.\n\nWait, 378 + 80 =458. Then 458 +21=479. 479 +42=521. No. Not enough. What if we do 378 * (80 - (42/21))? Let's compute 42/21=2. 80-2=78. 378*78=29484. Way too big. \n\nAlternatively, (378 + 80) * (42 -21). 378+80=458. 42-21=21. 458*21=9618.

Hmm, how do I start?\n\nFirst, maybe I should look at the target number, 840. Let me think about factors of 840. Breaking it down, 840 divided by 10 is 84. So 10 times 84 is 840.

The operations allowed are addition, subtraction, multiplication, division. Maybe I can start by looking at the target number, 163, and see how I can get close to that using these numbers.\n\nLooking at the numbers, 143 is the closest to 163. If I take 143 and add something to it, maybe. Let's see: 143 + 20 would be 163. Do I have numbers that can make 20? Well, 18 and 100 and 90 are left. Hmm. If I subtract 100 from 90, that gives me -10. Then maybe 18 - (something). Wait, maybe 18 + (90 - 100) = 18 -10 = 8. Then 143 +8 is 151, which is not enough. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 143 + 18 = 161. Then I need 2 more. But how? The remaining numbers are 100 and 90. 100 - 90 is 10. So 161 + 10 is 171, which is too much. Alternatively, 90 - 100 is -10, so 161 -10 is 151. Not helpful.\n\nWhat if I subtract something from 143? 143 - 100 =43. Then add 90 and 18. 43 +90 =133, +18=151. Still not 163.\n\nAlternatively, maybe multiply some numbers. Let's see. 18 * 10 is 180. Close to 163. But how to get 10? 100 divided by 10 is 10. Wait, but 100 is one of the numbers. If I do 100 /10, but then I need to get 10 from other numbers, but I can't use 100 again. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nWait, maybe 18 * 9 =162, which is close to 163. How to get 9 from the remaining numbers. 90 divided by 10 is 9. But 10 isn't available. Wait, 90 divided by (something). Let's see. If I have 90 divided by 10, but how to get 10? Maybe using 100 and 143? Hmm, maybe 143 - 133 =10, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of 163 as 100 + 63. Let's see: If I use 100, then need 63 from 18, 143, 90. 143 - 90 is 53, plus 10 is 63. But where does 10 come from? 18 -8=10? But where's the 8? Not sure.\n\nWait, 90 divided by 18 is 5. So 143 - (90/18) = 143 -5 =138. Then 100 +138=238, which is too big. Not helpful.\n\nWhat if I do 90 - (143 -100) =90 -43=47. Then 18 +47=65. Not 163.\n\nAlternatively, 100 + 90 =190. Then subtract something. 190 -27=163. How to get 27? 18 +9=27. How to get 9 from 143? 143 divided by something. 143/15.89 is about 9, but not exact. Hmm.\n\nWait, 143 divided by 18 is approximately 7.94. Not helpful. Maybe 18 multiplied by something. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, 143 + 90 =233. Then subtract (100 -18)=82. 233 -82=151. Still not 163.\n\nHmm. Maybe another approach. Let's try to split the numbers into two parts that can be combined. For example, (A + B) - (C - D) or something like that.\n\nLet's see, if I do (143 + 100) - (90 -18). Let's compute that: 243 -72=171. Close but not 163.\n\nOr (143 + 90) - (100 -18) =233 -82=151. No.\n\nHow about 90 + 100 =190. Then 190 - (143 / something). 143 divided by 18 is about 7.94. 190 -7.94≈182.06. Not helpful.\n\nWhat if I multiply 18 and 90 first? 18*90=1620. Then 1620 /10=162. But 10 is not a number here. Alternatively, 1620 / (100 +143) =1620 /243≈6.666. Not useful.\n\nAlternatively, 143 - (100 / (90/18)). Let's break that down. 90/18=5. Then 100/5=20. So 143 -20=123. Then add 90? Wait, but I already used 90 and 18. Wait, no. Wait, in this case, 100/(90/18) uses 100,90,18. Then 143 -20=123. Then I have 90 and 18 used already. Wait, no. Wait, 143 is used, 100,90,18 are used. Then all numbers are used, but the result is 123, which is not 163. So that's not working.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (143 + 18) + (90 -100). 161 + (-10)=151.

Maybe 100 -90=10. Then 161 +10=171. Not enough. Or 90 -100= -10, which gives 161 -10=151. No.\n\nWait, maybe multiply 100 and 18. 100*18=1800. Then divide by something. 1800/90=20. Then 143 +20=163. Wait, that works! Let me check the numbers used here.\n\n143 + (100*18)/90. Let's see. 100*18=1800. 1800/90=20. 143+20=163. But here, the numbers used are 100,18,90,143. Each exactly once. Yes! All numbers are used once. So the equation would be 143 + (100 * 18) / 90 = 163.\n\nLet me verify the calculation: 100 multiplied by 18 is 1800. 1800 divided by 90 is indeed 20. Then 143 plus 20 is 163. Perfect!\n\nSo the equation is 143 + (100 × 18) / 90 = 163.\n</think>\n\n<answer>143 + (100 * 18) / 90 = 163</answer>"}]}

If I subtract something from 820 to get closer to 848, but 820 is smaller than 848, so maybe I need to add instead. Wait, 820 is actually less than 848. The difference between them is 848 - 820 = 28.

Let's check 429 divided by 21. 429 ÷ 21 is approximately 20.428... That's not an integer, but maybe it's useful. Or 429 divided by 59. 59 times 7 is 413, and 59*7=413, so 429-413=16, so 429/59 is 7.271... Not an integer either. Hmm. Maybe multiplication? 21 multiplied by 59 is 1239. Adding that to 429 would be 1239 + 429 = 1668, which is way too big.\n\nAlternatively, maybe subtract some numbers. Let's think: 820 plus something. If I can get 820 + (something) = 848, then the something needs to be 28. How to get 28 from 21, 429, and 59. Let's see. 59 - (429 / 21). Let's calculate 429 divided by 21: that's 20.428... So 59 - 20.428 is approximately 38.571, which is not 28. Not helpful. Maybe 429 minus 21 is 408. 408 divided by something? If I take 408 divided by 59, that's about 6.915. Still not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe combine 429 and 59 first. 429 + 59 = 488. Then subtract 21: 488 -21 = 467. Adding that to 820: 820 + 467 = 1287. No, way over. Not helpful.\n\nWhat if I subtract 429 from 820? 820 -429= 391. Then add 59 and 21: 391 +59+21= 471. Not 848. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe multiply some numbers. Let's see. 21 multiplied by 59 is 1239. Then subtract 429: 1239 -429= 810. Then add 820: 810 +820=1630. Nope.\n\nWait, 820 plus 21 is 841. Then we need 7 more. How? The remaining numbers are 429 and 59. Maybe 429 divided by 59. Let's check: 429 ÷59 is approximately 7.271. So 841 +7.271≈848.271. Close but not exact. But since we need exact numbers, maybe this isn't possible. Wait, but maybe the division gives an integer. Let me check 429 divided by 59. 59*7=413, 59*7=413, 429-413=16. So 7 with remainder 16. So no, not an integer. So that approach might not work.\n\nAlternatively, 59 - (429 /21) = 59 -20.428≈38.571. Then 820 +38.571≈858.571. Not helpful.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe 820 plus 429 is 1249. Then subtract something. 1249 - 21*59. Let's compute 21*59: 1239. So 1249-1239=10. Then we have 10 left. Not helpful. Alternatively, 820 + (429 - 21*59). Let's calculate 21*59=1239. 429-1239= -810. So 820 + (-810)=10. Not good.\n\nWait, maybe 820 multiplied by something. 820 *1 =820. But 820 *1 + something. Not helpful. Alternatively, 820 divided by something. 820 /59 is around 13.898. Then add 21 and 429: 13.898 +21 +429≈463.898. Not close.\n\nHmm. Let's think differently. Let's see if 848 can be expressed as 820 + 28. But how to get 28 from 21,429,59. Let's try 59 - (429/21). As before, 429/21 is 20.428. 59-20.428≈38.571. Not 28. Alternatively, maybe (429 - 59)/21. 429-59=370. 370/21≈17.619. No. Not 28.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe 848 is 820 + (something). Let's see, 848-820=28. So need 28. Alternatively, maybe 820 plus 21 plus something. 820+21=841. 848-841=7. So need 7 from 429 and 59. How? 59 - (429 / something). Wait, 429 divided by 59 is about 7.271. So 429 /59≈7.271. If I take the integer part, maybe. But we need exact. So 59 - (429/x)=7. Then 429/x=52, x≈8.25. But we don't have 8.25. The numbers left are 21. Maybe 429/21=20.428. Not helpful. Alternatively, 429/x=52. So x=429/52≈8.25. Not possible with the given numbers.\n\nAlternatively, 429 - (59*7)=429-413=16. 16 +21=37. 820 +37=857. Not 848. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe we need to use multiplication and division in another way. Let's consider 21 * 429. That's a huge number: 21*429=9,009. Then subtract 820 and 59. 9,009 -820=8,189. 8,189 -59=8,130. Not close.\n\nAlternatively, 59*21=1,239. Then 1,239 +429=1,668. Then subtract 820: 1,668 -820=848. Wait, that works! Let me check that again.\n\n59 multiplied by 21 is 59*21=1239. Then add 429: 1239+429=1668. Then subtract 820: 1668 -820=848. Yes! That uses all numbers: 59, 21, 429, and 820. The operations are * , + , -. Let me verify each step:\n\n59*21 = 1239.\n\n1239 +429 = 1668.\n\n1668 -820 = 848.\n\nYes, exactly. So the equation would be (59*21) +429 -820 =848. But we have to use all numbers once. Let's check: 59,21,429,820. All used. So that's the equation.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(59 * 21) + 429 - 820 = 848</answer>"}]}

Hmm. Let me start by thinking about the target number, 175. Since 73 is a pretty big number, maybe I can start with that. If I subtract something from 73 to get close to 175, but wait, 73 is smaller than 175. Oh, right, so maybe adding instead.\n\nWait, 73 is part of the equation. So maybe 73 multiplied by something? Let's see. 73 times 2 is 146. Then, 146 plus 42 would be 188. That's over. But 188 minus 30 is 158, which is still not 175. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, 73 plus 2 is 75. Then 75 times something. If I use 42 and 30. Maybe 75 times 2 is 150, but I already used 2. Wait, no, each number can be used once. So maybe 73 + (2 * something). Let's think: 2 multiplied by 42 is 84. Then 73 + 84 is 157. Then 157 plus 30 is 187. That's over. Not helpful.\n\nWhat if I do 42 divided by 2? That would be 21. Then 73 plus 21 is 94. Then 94 plus 30 is 124. Still not 175.\n\nWait, maybe multiplication is needed here. Let's see: 42 times 30 is 1260. That's way too big. Maybe 42 + 30 is 72. Then 73 - 2 is 71. 72 and 71 don't help. Hmm.\n\nLet me try combining numbers in different ways. What if I take 73 and subtract something to get a number that when multiplied by another gives me 175. Wait, maybe 73 * 2 = 146. Then 175 - 146 = 29. So I need to get 29 from 42 and 30. That's tricky. 42 - 30 = 12, not 29. 30 - (42/ something), but 42 divided by what's left? We already used 2, 73, so maybe 42/ something else. Wait, all numbers have to be used once. So 42 and 30 are the remaining numbers. So 42 - 30 =12. 146 +12=158. Not enough. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, 73 + (2 * 42) = 73 +84=157. Then 157 +30=187. No. Still over. 157 is close to 175. 175-157=18. Can I get 18 from 30 somehow? 30- something? But I already used 2, 42, 73. Wait, maybe a different approach.\n\nWhat if I take 30 * (something). For example, 30*5=150. Then 150 +25=175. How to get 5 and 25 from the remaining numbers. Hmm. 73 and 2 and 42. Wait, 73 - 42=31. 31 +2=33. Doesn't help. 42/2=21. Then 21 +30=51. 73 +51=124. Not 175.\n\nWait, 73*2=146. Then 146 + 30=176. Oh, that's 176, which is just 1 more than 175. So if I can subtract 1 from 176, but how? The remaining number is 42. So 176 - (42/x), but x has to be one of the numbers used. Wait, all numbers must be used, so maybe 42 divided by something. But the numbers left are already used. Wait, I used 73,2,30 in 73*2 +30=176. Then 42 is left. Maybe 176 - (42/ something). But 42 divided by what? I already used 2. So maybe that approach isn't possible.\n\nAlternatively, 42 - 30=12. Then 73 *2 +12= 146+12=158. Still not 175.\n\nWhat if I do 30*(something) plus something. For example, 30*5=150, then 150+25=175. To get 5 and 25 from 73,2,42. Let's see. 42/2=21. 73-21=52. Hmm, not helpful. 73 - (42/2)=73-21=52. Then 52 +30=82. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (73 + 42) * something. 73+42=115. 115*2=230. Then 230-30=200. Not 175.\n\nWait, 73 * (30 / 2). Let's compute that. 30 divided by 2 is 15. 73*15=1095. That's way too big. Then subtract 42? 1095-42=1053. No.\n\nHmm, maybe (42 +30) * something. 72*2=144. 144+73=217. Then 217- something? But we already used all numbers. Wait, 42+30=72. 72*2=144. 144 +73=217. That uses all numbers except 30? Wait no, 42 and 30 are used in the sum. 2 is used in multiplication. Then 73 is added. So that's all four numbers. Wait, 42 +30 +2 +73=147. Not 175.\n\nWait, let me check if subtraction can help. For example, 73*2=146. Then 146 +42=188. 188 -30=158. No. Or 73*2 +42=188. Then 188-30=158. Still no.\n\nWait, maybe 73 + (30 * something). 30*5=150. 73+150=223. Then 223 - something=175. 223-48=175. How to get 48 from 2 and 42. 42 + 2=44. Not 48. 42*2=84. 223-84=139. Not helpful. 42/2=21. 223-21=202. No.\n\nAnother approach: 175 is 5*35. Can I create 5 and 35 from the numbers? 30/ (42- something). 30 divided by (42-36)=6, but how to get 36. Not sure. Alternatively, 2 * something. Let me see. 35 could be 73 -38. But 38 would need to come from 42 and 30. 42-30=12. Not 38. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe (73 - (42/2)) * something. 42/2=21. 73-21=52. 52* (30/ something). 30 divided by... but all numbers are used. Wait, 30 is left. So 52 * (30/10), but 10 is not a number here. Hmm. Alternatively, 52 +30=82. Not helpful.\n\nLet me try another angle. Let's see 175 divided by 73 is approximately 2.397. So if I can make a multiplier around 2.4. 73*2.4=175.2. Close. But how to get 2.4 from 2, 30, 42. 30/ (42 - something). Maybe 30/(42 - 2)=30/40=0.75. Then 73*(2 +0.75)=73*2.75=200.75. Not helpful. Alternatively, (30 +42)/2=72/2=36. 73 +36=109. No.\n\nWait, 73 * 2 =146. Then 146 + (42 -30)=146+12=158. Still not 175.\n\nAlternatively, 73 +2=75. 42 +30=72. 75*72=5400. Way too big. Not useful.\n\nWait, 42 * 30=1260. 1260 divided by something. 1260 / (73 +2)=1260/75=16.8. Then 16.8. Not helpful.\n\nHmm. Maybe using division in a different way. Like 73 + (42 * 2) +30. 73+84=157+30=187. Still over. Or 73 + (42 * something). Let me think. 42*4=168. 168+7=175. But 4 and 7 from where? The remaining numbers are 2 and 30. Hmm, 30/2=15. So 42* (30/2)=42*15=630. 630 +73=703. No. 630 -73=557. Not helpful.\n\nWait, what if I do 30*2=60. Then 60 +73=133. Then 133 +42=175. Oh! Wait, 30*2=60. 60 +73=133. 133 +42=175. That uses all four numbers: 30, 2, 73, 42. Let me check: 30*2 +73 +42. Yes! 60 +73 is 133, plus 42 is 175. So the equation is 30*2 +73 +42 =175. But wait, the problem says you have to use all the numbers once. So that's correct. 30*2=60, then adding 73 and 42. So the equation is (30 * 2) + 73 + 42 = 175. But can I write that as 30*2 +73 +42? Let me compute:\n\n30*2=60\n\n60+73=133\n\n133+42=175.\n\nYes, that works. So all numbers are used once. Let me verify the numbers: 30, 2,73,42. All used. Operations: multiplication and addition. So this seems to fit. I think that's the solution.\n</think>\n\n<answer>30 * 2 + 73 + 42 = 175</answer>"}]}

Let's see... Hmm.\n\nFirst, 103 is a bit more than 96. Maybe I can use 96 as a base and then add or subtract the other numbers. Let's check: 96 + 5 = 101. Then adding 1 and 2 would be 101 + 1 + 2 = 104, which is too much. But maybe combining them differently? Like 96 + 5 + 2 = 103, but then I still have 1 left. Oh, right, I have to use all numbers. So that approach might not work.\n\nWait, what if I subtract something from 96? Let's see. 96 + (5 * 2) = 96 +10=106. Then subtract 1? 106-1=105. Not enough. Alternatively, 96 + 5* (something). Let's think. 5*2=10, 96+10=106, minus 3 would be 103, but I don't have 3. Wait, but I have 1 and 2. Maybe 5*(2+1)=15. Then 96 +15=111. That's way over. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe multiply 5 and 1 to get 5, then 96 +5=101, plus 2 is 103. Wait, that works! Let me check: 96 + (5*1) + 2 = 96 +5 +2 = 103. Yes! But wait, are all numbers used? 96, 5, 1, 2. Yes, each once. So the equation would be 96 + 5*1 + 2 = 103. But can I write it as (5*1) to make sure operations are clear? Alternatively, maybe parentheses aren't needed since multiplication comes first. So 96 + 5*1 +2 = 103. Let me verify: 5*1 is 5, then 96+5 is 101, plus 2 is 103. Perfect. But is there another way? Let me check if other combinations could also work, just to make sure.\n\nAnother approach: 96 + (5*2) -1. That would be 96 +10=106 -1=105. Not 103. How about 96 + (5 + 2) *1. That's 96 +7=103. Wait, 5+2=7, multiplied by 1 is 7. 96 +7=103. So that would be 96 + (5 +2)*1 =103. That uses all numbers: 96,5,2,1. Each once. So that's another possible equation. Let me check: 5+2=7, times 1 is 7, 96+7=103. Correct. So this is another valid equation. So both 96 +5*1 +2 and 96 + (5+2)*1 would work.\n\nBut the problem says to create an equation. Either way, both are correct. But maybe the first one is simpler. Alternatively, maybe combining 5 and 2 first. Let's see. For example, (5*2) +96 +1=10+96+1=107. No. Or (5*2) +96 -1=105. Still not. \n\nAlternatively, 96 +5 +2*1. That's 96+5=101 +2=103. Wait, but 2*1 is 2. So 96+5+2*1=96+5+2=103. But here, is the multiplication done first? Yes. So the equation would be 96 +5 +2*1=103. That's another valid way. So that's 96 +5 + (2*1). But order of operations would handle it without parentheses. So yes. So that's another way. So there are multiple possibilities. \n\nBut the problem allows any of these as long as all numbers are used once. So any of these equations would work. Let me just confirm each step again to make sure there's no mistake. For example, in the equation 96 + (5+2)*1=103: 5+2=7, multiplied by 1 is 7, plus 96 is 103. Correct. And in the equation 96 +5*1 +2=103: 5*1=5, 96+5=101, +2=103. Correct. Or 96 +5 +2*1=103: same as above. All are valid. \n\nSo I can choose any of these. Let me pick one. Maybe the one with (5+2)*1. Because it groups 5 and 2 first, which are smaller numbers, making the equation a bit more structured. So the equation would be 96 + (5 + 2) × 1 = 103. Alternatively, using the multiplication first: 96 + 5 × 1 + 2. Either way. The parentheses might make it clearer. \n\nWait, the problem says to return the equation in the answer tags. Let me check the example: <answer>(1 + 2) / 3</answer>. So the user probably expects parentheses if needed. In the case of (5+2)*1, parentheses are needed to add 5 and 2 first. So that's acceptable. Alternatively, if it's written as 96 + 5*1 + 2, that would also work. Let me check the arithmetic again. \n\nWait, 5*1 is 5, so 96+5=101, then +2=103. Correct. So that equation is 96 +5*1 +2=103. Which uses all numbers once. So either equation is acceptable. I think the second one is slightly more straightforward. Let me go with that. So the answer is 96 +5*1 +2=103. So written as (96 + (5 * 1) + 2) but maybe parentheses are not needed. Alternatively, 96 + 5 * 1 + 2. Since multiplication comes before addition, it's evaluated correctly. So the equation would be 96 + 5 * 1 + 2 = 103. \n\nAlternatively, if I want to group operations for clarity, maybe (5 * 1) but it's not necessary. So the answer is 96 + 5 * 1 + 2 = 103. Let me verify once again: 5*1=5, 96+5=101, 101+2=103. Perfect. Yes. All numbers used: 96,5,1,2. Correct.\n</think>\n\n<answer>96 + 5 * 1 + 2 = 103</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using the numbers 87, 10, 13, and 76, each exactly once, with basic arithmetic operations, to get 337. Hmm. Let me start by thinking about the target number, 337. It's a prime number, right? So that might complicate things because prime numbers can't be factored into smaller integers. But maybe with addition or subtraction.\n\nFirst, let's check the numbers we have. The largest number is 87, followed by 76. Then 13 and 10. Maybe if I can combine the two big numbers first. Let's see: 87 + 76 is 163. That's not enough. 87 * 76 would be way too big, like 6612, which is way over. So maybe subtraction? 87 - 76 is 11. Hmm, but then using that with the other numbers... Maybe 87 + 76 = 163, then adding 13 would be 176, plus 10 is 186. Still way below 337. That approach isn't working.\n\nWait, maybe I can multiply some of the numbers. For example, if I multiply 76 by something. Let's see, 76 * 10 is 760. That's way over. Maybe 76 * 13. Let's calculate that: 76 * 10 is 760, plus 76*3 is 228, so 760 + 228 = 988. Still too big. Hmm. But maybe combining that with subtraction. If I take 988 and subtract 87, that's 901. Still way over. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe multiply 87 by something. 87 * 10 is 870. Subtract 76? 870 -76 = 794. Then subtract 13? 794-13=781. No. Not helpful. Or 87 * 13. Let's compute that: 80*13=1040, 7*13=91, so 1040+91=1131. That's way too big. Subtract 76 and 10? 1131 -76=1055, minus10=1045. No.\n\nHmm. Maybe combining addition and multiplication. Let's think about the target 337. Let's see if I can get close to that with some combination. Let's see: 76 * 4 = 304. But 4 isn't one of our numbers. Wait, but maybe 76 multiplied by something else. For example, 76 * (10 - (13 - 87))? Wait, but that's getting complicated. Let me think step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 87 + 76 = 163. Then 163 + 13*10. Wait, 13*10 is 130. So 163 +130 = 293. Still under 337. The difference is 44. Not sure. Maybe instead of adding 13*10, perhaps a different combination.\n\nWait, what if I do 87 * 10 = 870. Then 76 -13 = 63. Then 870 -63 = 807. No, that's not right. Alternatively, 870 - (76 +13) = 870 -89=781. Still no.\n\nWait, let's think of 337 as being close to 340. So 340 -3. But how to get that? Let's see, 76 + 13=89. 89 * something. 89*3=267. 89*4=356. 356 is closer. Hmm. 356 is 356-19=337. But where do I get 19? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 87 * 4 = 348. 348 -11=337. But again, where do 4 and 11 come from?\n\nAlternatively, using division. For example, if I divide 76 by something. 76 divided by 10 is 7.6. Not helpful. 76 divided by 13 is around 5.846. Not helpful. 87 divided by 13 is around 6.692. Hmm. Not obvious.\n\nWait, maybe 76 * 10 = 760. Then 760 - 87 = 673. Then 673 divided by 2 is 336.5, which is close to 337, but we don't have a 2. Alternatively, 760 - 87*5. Let's see: 87*5=435. 760-435=325. Then add 12. But 12 isn't available. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, let's try combining 13 and 10 in a way. 13*10=130. Then 337-130=207. So need to make 207 with 87 and 76. 87 +76=163, which is not enough. 87*2=174. Still no. 76*2=152. Not helpful. 76 + 87=163. 163 + something. Wait, but 207-163=44. So maybe 76* something plus 87* something. But we can only use each number once. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe 87 + (76 * (13 -10)). Let's see: 13-10=3. 76*3=228. 228 +87=315. Close but still 22 short. Not enough.\n\nWait, maybe (87 + 76) * something. 87+76=163. 163*2=326. Close to 337. Difference is 11. If I could get 163*2 +11, but 11 could be 13-2, but I don't have a 2. Alternatively, 13 - (10 / something). Hmm. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, 87 * 3 = 261. Then 76 *1=76. 261 +76=337. Wait, that's exactly 337. But how to get 3 from 10 and 13. Because 13 -10=3. So maybe 87*(13-10) +76. Let's check: (13-10)=3. 87*3=261. 261+76=337. Yes! That works. Wait, but we need to use all numbers. Let's see: 13 and 10 are used in (13-10). Then 87 and 76. So all numbers are used once. Perfect!\n\nSo the equation is 87*(13-10)+76=337. Let me check the math again. 13-10=3. 87*3=261. 261+76=337. Exactly. So that's the equation.\n</think>\n\n<answer>87 * (13 - 10) + 76 = 337</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using the numbers 61, 18, 59, and 18, each exactly once, and the result should be 2. The operations allowed are +, -, *, /. Hmm. Let me start by listing out the numbers and thinking about possible combinations.\n\nFirst, I notice there are two 18s. Maybe that's useful. Since they are the same number, perhaps subtracting them would give zero, or dividing them gives 1. Let me try that. If I do 18 - 18, that's 0. Then I have 61 and 59 left. 61 - 59 is 2. Then combining those: (61 - 59) + (18 - 18) = 2 + 0 = 2. Wait, but that uses all the numbers. Let's check: 61, 59, 18, 18. Yes, all used once. So that would be (61 - 59) + (18 - 18) = 2. Is that right? Let's calculate: 61-59 is 2, 18-18 is 0. 2 + 0 = 2. Yes! That works. But wait, the problem says each number can be used once. So 18 is used twice here. Oh wait, no, the original numbers given are two 18s. Wait the user provided 61, 18, 59, 18. So there are two 18s. So in that case, since each number in the list is used once, but there are two 18s, so using each of them once is okay. So in that case, the equation would be valid. Let me confirm. The problem states: \"each number can only be used once, and you must use all the numbers.\" Since the numbers given are 61, 18, 59, 18, then using each of these four numbers once is required. So using both 18s is necessary. So the equation (61 - 59) + (18 - 18) = 2 is acceptable because each of the four numbers (61, 18, 59, 18) is used once. Let me check the arithmetic again: 61-59 is 2, 18-18 is 0. Adding them gives 2. Yes. That seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe another combination. Let's see. What if I do 61 - 59 = 2, and then 18 / 18 = 1. Then 2 * 1 = 2. So that could be (61 - 59) * (18 / 18) = 2. That also works. Let me see: 61-59=2, 18/18=1, 2*1=2. Uses all numbers once each. So that's another possibility. So that would be (61 - 59) * (18 / 18) = 2.\n\nAre there other ways? Let's try. Maybe 59 - (61 - (18/18)). Let's compute: 18/18=1, 61-1=60, then 59-60= -1. Not 2. Hmm. Not helpful.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe using multiplication and division. Let's see. 61 and 59 are both primes. 18 is 2*3*3. Maybe 61 divided by something. 61 divided by (18 + 18 -59). Wait, 18+18=36, 36-59= -23. So 61 / (-23) is like -2.65... Not 2. Not helpful.\n\nWait, let's think of combining all four numbers in an expression. Like 61 - 59 + 18 - 18. Which is the same as (61 -59) + (18-18) = 2+0=2. So that's another way to write the same equation as before. So maybe 61 - 59 + 18 - 18 = 2. But since we can use parentheses, perhaps the way to present it is (61 - 59) + (18 - 18) = 2, which is the same.\n\nAlternatively, 18 - 18 = 0, so adding that to 61 -59 gives the same result. So both equations are valid. But the problem allows using operations multiple times, so either way is acceptable.\n\nAnother possibility: (61 + 59) divided by something. 61+59=120. 120 divided by (18 + 18) = 120/36=3.333... Not 2. No. Hmm. What about (61 - (59 + 18)) / 18. Let's compute: 59+18=77. 61-77= -16. -16 /18 is -0.888... Not 2. Not helpful.\n\nWhat if we do (61 + 18) - (59 + 18). Let's see: 61+18=79, 59+18=77. 79-77=2. Oh! That's another way. So (61 + 18) - (59 + 18) = 2. Let's check: 61+18=79, 59+18=77. 79-77=2. Yes! This uses all four numbers: 61, 18, 59, 18. Each used once, and all operations are addition and subtraction. That works. So that's another valid equation: (61 + 18) - (59 + 18) = 2.\n\nSo there are multiple solutions. Let me confirm each step again. For the first solution: (61 -59) + (18 -18) = 2. Correct. Second solution: (61 -59) * (18 /18) =2. Third solution: (61 +18) - (59 +18)=2. All are valid. So which one should I choose? The problem says to return the final equation in the answer tags, any of them is correct. Let's pick the third one because it's straightforward. But maybe the user expects one of the possible answers. Let me check if there are any other possibilities.\n\nAnother approach: 18 divided by something. For example, 61 - (59 + (18 /18)). Let's compute: 18/18=1, 59+1=60, 61-60=1. Not 2. Not helpful. How about (61 +59) / (18 +18). 61+59=120, 18+18=36. 120/36=3.333... No. Not 2.\n\nAlternatively, (61 - (18 /18)) -59. 18/18=1. 61-1=60. 60-59=1. Not 2. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, 61/(59 - (18/18)). Let's compute denominator: 59 -1=58. 61/58≈1.05... Not 2.\n\nAlternatively, 18/( (61 -59)/18 ). Let's see: 61-59=2. 2/18=1/9. Then 18/(1/9)=162. Not 2. No.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe (18 * (61 -59)) /18. Let's compute: 61-59=2. 18*2=36. 36/18=2. That works. So that would be (18 * (61 -59)) /18 =2. Let's check: 61-59=2, multiplied by 18 gives 36. Divided by 18 gives 2. Yes. So this uses all four numbers: 18, 61,59,18. Each once. So the equation is (18 * (61 -59)) / 18 =2. Simplifies to 36/18=2. Correct. So that's another valid solution.\n\nSo many possibilities! Let me list them again:\n\n1. (61 -59) + (18 -18) =2\n\n2. (61 -59) * (18 /18) =2\n\n3. (61 +18) - (59 +18) =2\n\n4. (18*(61-59))/18=2\n\nAny of these are correct. The problem allows any basic operations used multiple times, so all are acceptable. The user just needs one equation. So perhaps the third one is the most straightforward, as it doesn't involve multiplication or division, just addition and subtraction. Let me check the third solution again: 61+18 is 79, 59+18 is 77. 79-77=2. Correct. So the equation is (61 + 18) - (59 + 18) =2. Alternatively, since addition is associative, maybe written as 61 +18 -59 -18=2. But using parentheses makes it clearer.\n\nAnother way to write it: 61 -59 +18 -18. Which simplifies to (61 -59) + (18 -18) =2. But the same as the first solution.\n\nSo the answer could be any of these. Let's pick one. Maybe the (61 +18) - (59 +18) =2. Because it uses all numbers in two groups. Let's present that as the answer.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(61 + 18) - (59 + 18) = 2</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using all the numbers 86, 43, 55, and 504 exactly once, with basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) to get 492. Hmm, that's a bit of a challenge. Let me start by thinking about how these numbers can combine.\n\nFirst, let me note the target is 492. Let's look at the numbers given. The largest number here is 504, which is close to 492. Maybe I can subtract something from 504 to get close. 504 minus 12 is 492. So if I can get 12 from the other numbers (86, 43, 55), that might work. Let me check: 86, 43, 55. Let's see. If I subtract 43 from 55, that's 12. So 55 - 43 = 12. Then 504 - (55 - 43) = 504 - 12 = 492. Wait, but that uses 504, 55, and 43, leaving out 86. But I need to use all numbers. So that approach doesn't work because 86 is left unused. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe multiply some numbers. Let's see. 86 and 43. If I do 86 * 43, that's way too big. 86 * 43 is 3698, which is way over. Maybe divide? 86 divided by 43 is 2. Then 504 divided by something. Let's see. 504 divided by (86/43) is 504 / 2 = 252. Not helpful. Hmm.\n\nAnother angle: 504 minus 86 is 418. Then 418 plus 55 is 473, which is still less than 492. Then adding 43 would give 516, which is over. Alternatively, 504 - 86 - 43 = 504 - 129 = 375. That's too low. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe 55 times something. 55*9 = 495, which is close to 492. But how to get 9 from the other numbers. Let's see. 86, 43, 504. Hmm. 504 divided by 86 is approximately 5.86. Not 9. 504 divided by 43 is about 11.72. Not helpful. Alternatively, 86 - 43 = 43. 43/ something. Maybe 504 divided by (86 - 43) = 504 /43 = 11.72. Then 55 - 11.72 is 43.28. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 86 - (55 - 43) = 86 - 12 = 74. Then 504 - 74 = 430. Not 492. Hmm.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Let's try to use all numbers. So maybe combine two numbers into an operation, then combine with another, etc. For example, maybe (504 - 86) = 418. Then 418 + 55 = 473. 473 + 43 = 516. That's over. Alternatively, 504 - (86 + 55) = 504 - 141 = 363. Then 363 + 43 = 406. Still not 492.\n\nWhat if we multiply? Let's see. 43 * 55 = 2365. That's way too big. Maybe subtract that from 504. 504 - 2365 = negative. Not useful. Hmm.\n\nWait, what if we do 504 divided by 43? 504/43 is approximately 11.72. Then multiply by 55? 11.72*55 is around 644.6. Then subtract 86? 644.6 -86= 558.6. Not 492. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 504 divided by 55 is about 9.16. Multiply by 43: 9.16*43≈394. Then add 86: 394+86=480. Close, but not 492.\n\nHmm. Maybe combine operations in a different order. Let's try (504 - 86) = 418. Then 55 - 43 = 12. Then 418 + 12 = 430. Still not.\n\nAlternatively, 504 - (86 - 55) = 504 -31=473. Then 473 + 43=516. No.\n\nWait, maybe 86 * (55 - 43) = 86 *12=1032. Then 504 +1032=1536. Not helpful.\n\nWait, 504 - 55=449. Then 449 +43=492. Oh! Wait, that's 492. But that uses 504, 55, 43. But where is 86? So we have to include 86. So maybe 504 - 55 +43 = 492. But then 86 is unused. So that doesn't work. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe (504 - 55) + (43 - 86) = 449 + (-43) = 406. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 504 - (55 +43) = 504 -98=406. Then 406 +86=492. Wait! That works. Let me check: 55 +43=98. 504 -98=406. Then 406 +86=492. But wait, that uses 55,43,504, and 86. All numbers. But operations are (55+43), then subtract from 504, then add 86. So the equation would be 504 - (55 +43) +86 = 492. Let me compute step by step:\n\nFirst, 55 +43=98.\n\nThen 504 -98=406.\n\n406 +86=492. Yes, that works. But does this use each number once? Yes: 504,55,43,86. All used once. And all operations are allowed. So the equation is 504 - (55 +43) +86 = 492. But wait, how is the order? Let me write it properly: 504 - (55 +43) +86. Since addition and subtraction are left associative, so it's (504 - (55+43)) +86. Which is 504-98=406, then 406+86=492. Correct.\n\nBut let me check if there's another way. Maybe using multiplication or division. For example, 86 and 43: 86/43=2. Then 504 - 55*2=504-110=394. 394+ something? But we already used 86,43,55,504. Wait, 55*2 uses 55 and 2 (which is from 86/43). So that's 86,43,55. Then 504 - (55*(86/43)) = 504 - (55*2)=504-110=394. Then need to use the remaining number? Wait, no, because 86,43,55,504 are all used in this case. But 394 is not 492. So that doesn't work.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe 504 divided by something. Let's see. 504 divided by (86 -55) = 504 /31≈16.258. Then multiply by 43: 16.258*43≈700. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 86*55=4730. Then 4730 divided by 43=110. Then 504 -110=394. Not helpful.\n\nHmm. Wait, going back to the previous solution: 504 - (55 +43) +86 =492. That works and uses all numbers. So maybe that's the answer. Let me just verify again:\n\n55 +43 =98\n\n504 -98 =406\n\n406 +86=492. Yes, correct. So the equation is 504 -55 -43 +86 =492. Alternatively, written as 504 - (55 +43) +86. But parentheses are necessary to group 55+43. Alternatively, since subtraction is left associative, writing 504 -55 -43 +86 would be the same as (504 -55) -43 +86, but let me check:\n\n504 -55 =449\n\n449 -43=406\n\n406 +86=492. Yes, same result. So the equation can be written as 504 -55 -43 +86 =492. So all numbers are used once, each operation is subtraction and addition, which are allowed. So this seems to work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another equation using different operations, but this seems straightforward. Let me check if there are any other possibilities.\n\nFor example, 86 -43=43. Then 504 -43=461. Then 55* something. Hmm. 55* (something) =461? Not sure. 461/55≈8.38. Not an integer. So maybe not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 43* (something). Let's see. 504 divided by 86=5.86. 5.86*43=252. Then 55* something. Hmm. 252 +55=307. Doesn't help.\n\nAnother idea: 86 +55=141. 504 -141=363. 363 + (43)=406. No, same as before. Wait, no: 363 +43=406. Then adding 86 would be 406+86=492. Wait, but then 86 is already used in 86+55. So this approach would use 86 twice. Not allowed.\n\nSo the only valid equation is 504 -55 -43 +86=492. Let me confirm once more:\n\n504 -55=449\n\n449 -43=406\n\n406 +86=492. Correct.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the equation is 504 -55 -43 +86=492. Each number is used once, and all numbers are used. The operations are subtraction and addition. That's acceptable. So the final answer is (504 -55 -43 +86)=492. Alternatively, without the parentheses since operations are left associative, but to make it clear, maybe write it as (504 - (55 +43)) +86. But either way, the equation works.\n</think>\n\n<answer>504 - 55 - 43 + 86 = 492</answer>"}]}

Let me think.\n\nFirst, 483 is a bit over 400. Let me see what combinations can get close. 47 is a big number. Maybe multiply some of the larger numbers together. Let's see:\n\n47 times 11 is 517. That's higher than 483. Hmm. 47 times 10 would be 470, but I don't have 10. Wait, maybe 47*(something). Alternatively, 42 and 47 are both big. 42*11 is 462. Then adding 26 would be 488. Close, but 488 is 5 over. Not quite. Wait, 462 +26=488. Not 483. Hmm.\n\nWhat if I do 47*11=517, then subtract something. 517 - (42-26). Let's check: 42-26=16. 517-16=501. Still not. Maybe 517 - 42 +26. That's 517-42=475, 475+26=501. No. Alternatively, 47*(11) + something. 47*10 is 470, so 47*11=517. 517 minus 34 (since 42-26=16, but 34 is not directly available). Wait, maybe other operations.\n\nLet's try 42*26=1092. That's way too big. Divided by something? 1092 divided by, say, 11 is 99.27... No. 1092 -47=1045, still too big. Maybe subtract more. Not helpful.\n\nHow about 47* (42 - something). Let's see, 42-11=31. 47*31=1457. That's way over. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe combining addition and multiplication. Let's see: 42 + 47 =89. 89 * 11=979. 979 -26=953. Still not. Alternatively, 89 * (11 -26). That would be negative, which probably isn't helpful.\n\nHmm. Let's try different combinations. What if I use division? Maybe 47 divided by something. For example, 47/11 is about 4.27. Then 4.27 * (42+26) = 4.27*68 ≈ 290. Not close. \n\nAlternatively, 42*11=462. 462 +26=488. Then 488 -47=441. No. Not 483. \n\nWait, 483 divided by 47 is roughly 10.27. Maybe 47*(something around 10). Let's see, 47*10=470, and then add 13. But where would 13 come from? 26-11=15. 470+15=485. Close, but 485 is 2 over. Or 47*10.27... Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 47* (11 + something). 11+26=37. 47*37=1739, way too big.\n\nWhat about 26*11=286. 286 +42=328. 328 +47=375. Not enough. \n\nWait, maybe subtract something. Let's try 47*11=517. Then 517 - (42 -26). 42-26=16, so 517-16=501. Not 483. Or 517 - (42 +26) =517-68=449. No.\n\nAlternatively, 47*(26 -11). 26-11=15. 47*15=705. Then 705 -42=663. Not helpful.\n\nWait, 26*42=1092. Then 1092 / something. Let's see, 1092 divided by 47 is around 23.23. Then 23.23 +11≈34.23. Not helpful. Or 1092 -47=1045. Then 1045 divided by 11 is 95. Not 483.\n\nHmm. Maybe using parentheses in a different way. Let's try combining numbers: (47 -11) * (42 -26). That's 36 *16=576. 576 is close but not 483. 576- (remaining numbers? But I used all numbers already. Wait, (47-11)=36, (42-26)=16. 36*16=576. But that uses all numbers. 576 is 93 over. Not helpful.\n\nAnother approach: 483 is 3*7*23. Maybe factors. Let's see. 483 divided by 47 is 10.276. Not a whole number. Divided by 42 is 11.5. Divided by 11 is 43.9. Divided by 26 is about 18.57. Not helpful.\n\nWait, what if I use subtraction and multiplication. Let's see: 47*(42 - 26) =47*16=752. Then subtract 11: 752-11=741. Not 483. Or maybe 47* (42 - (26+11)). 26+11=37. 42-37=5. 47*5=235. No.\n\nAlternatively, 42*(47 -26) =42*21=882. 882-11=871. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe (42 + 47) * something. 42+47=89. 89*5.4=483. But how to get 5.4 from 26 and 11. 26/11 is around 2.36. Not 5.4.\n\nAlternatively, 89*(11) =979. 979-26=953. Not 483.\n\nHmm. Let me try another angle. Let's see, 483=47*10 +13. But where does 13 come from? 26-11=15, which is 2 more. 47*10=470, 470+ (26-11)=470+15=485. Close, but 2 off. \n\nAlternatively, 47*10.27=483. But to get 10.27 from 42,26,11. Maybe (42 +26)/11 =68/11≈6.18. Not enough. 42/11≈3.82. 26/11≈2.36. 3.82 +2.36=6.18. Still not 10.27.\n\nWait, 42*11=462. Then 462 +21=483. But where does 21 come from? 47-26=21. Ah! So 42*11 + (47-26) =462 +21=483. Let's check:\n\n42*11=462. 47-26=21. 462+21=483. Yes! But wait, are all numbers used exactly once? 42, 11, 47,26. Yes. Each used once. So the equation would be 42*11 +47 -26. But let's make sure the order of operations is correct. Since multiplication comes first, it's (42*11) +47 -26. That would work. Alternatively, 42*11 + (47-26). Both are the same. So the equation is (42 × 11) + 47 − 26 = 483. Let me check the calculation again: 42*11=462. 47-26=21. 462+21=483. Yes! That works. So the equation is 42*11 +47 -26. Since we need to use all numbers once, this uses 42,11,47,26. Correct.\n</think>\n\n<answer>42 * 11 + 47 - 26 = 483</answer>"}]}

Each number must be used exactly once, and the result should be 782. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let's recall the target is 782. Let me look at the numbers provided. 672 and 552 are both large numbers, so maybe subtracting them could help? Let's check: 672 - 552 = 120. Hmm, that's not close. What if I subtract 17 from 672? 672 - 17 = 655. Still not enough. Maybe adding some of them? 672 + 552 = 1224. That's way over. Maybe combining multiplication and division?\n\nLet's consider 17. Since 782 divided by 17 is 46, so maybe 17 multiplied by something gives 782. Wait, 17*46=782. So if I can get 46 from the other numbers, that might work. The remaining numbers are 56, 672, 552. How can I get 46 from those? Let's see:\n\n56 - (something) = 46? That would need 10. But the other numbers are 672 and 552. Maybe 672 divided by 552? 672/552 is approximately 1.217, not helpful. 672 - 552 = 120. If I use 56 + (672 - 552) = 56 + 120 = 176. Then 176/ something? 176 divided by 17 is not it. Wait, maybe 56 + (something) to get 46? That would require subtracting, but I can't just subtract without using another number.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 552 divided by something. 552 divided by 12 is 46. Wait, do I have a 12? Not directly. But 672 divided by 56 is 12. Because 56*12=672. Oh, that's a thought. So 672 / 56 = 12. Then 552 / 12 = 46. Then 46 * 17 = 782. Let me check:\n\nSo 672 divided by 56 is 12. Then 552 divided by that 12 gives 46. Multiply by 17 gives 46*17=782. So putting that together: ((552 / (672 / 56)) * 17) = 782. Let's verify the steps:\n\n672 ÷ 56 = 12.\n\n552 ÷ 12 = 46.\n\n46 × 17 = 782. Yes! And all numbers are used once: 56, 672, 552, 17. Perfect. So the equation would be (552 / (672 / 56)) * 17 = 782. Let me write that as (552 / (672 ÷ 56)) * 17. That uses all numbers once. Let me check the order of operations. Division first inside the parentheses: 672 ÷ 56 =12. Then 552 ÷12=46. Then 46 *17=782. Yep, that works. I think that's the solution.\n</think>\n\n<answer>((552 / (672 / 56)) * 17) = 782</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using the numbers 64, 82, 19, and 64, each exactly once, with basic operations to get 63. Hmm. Let's start by listing out the numbers and the target. The target is 63, and the numbers are two 64s, 82, and 19. Wait, the problem says each number can be used once, but there are two 64s. So does that mean each instance of 64 has to be used once? So I can use both 64s separately? The problem states: \"each number can only be used once\", but since there are two 64s, maybe they are considered separate numbers here. So I need to use both 64s. So total four numbers: 64, 82, 19, 64. Got it.\n\nFirst, maybe look for ways to get close to 63. Let's see. Let's think of possible operations. Maybe subtract some numbers. For example, 82 minus 19 is 63. Wait, 82 - 19 is 63. But then I have two 64s left. How do I handle that? Because I have to use all numbers. So if I do 82 - 19 = 63, then I need to include the two 64s. But how? If I have to use all four numbers, maybe combine them with multiplication or division.\n\nAlternatively, can I combine the two 64s in some way that cancels them out? Like 64 - 64 = 0, but then how to get 63 from 82 and 19. Wait, but 82 - 19 is already 63. So maybe 82 - 19 + (64 - 64) = 63. But that uses all numbers. Wait, but addition and subtraction can be arranged. So (82 - 19) + (64 - 64) = 63 + 0 = 63. That would work. Let me check: 82 - 19 is 63, 64 -64 is 0. Adding them gives 63. But does the problem allow using parentheses like that? The example shows parentheses, so probably yes. But the problem is, do we have to use each number once? Let's check: 82, 19, 64, 64. So yes, each is used once. So the equation would be (82 - 19) + (64 - 64) = 63. But let's verify the arithmetic: 82-19=63, 64-64=0, 63+0=63. Yes. That works. But wait, in the problem statement, the example uses all numbers. So this equation uses all four numbers. So that should be acceptable. Let me see if there's another way, but maybe this is the simplest.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using division or multiplication. Let's see. For example, 64 divided by something. 64 divided by (something) could give a number. Let's see. 64 / (82 - 19 -64). Wait, 82 -19=63, 63 -64= -1. So 64 / (-1) = -64, which isn't helpful. Hmm. Or maybe 82 - (64 / 64) -19. Let's compute that: 64/64=1. Then 82 -1 -19= 82-20=62. Close but not 63. Alternatively, 82 - (19 + (64/64)). 64/64=1, 19+1=20. 82-20=62. Still no. How about (82 + 64) - (19 + 64). Let's see: 82+64=146, 19+64=83. 146-83=63. Ah! That's another way. So (82 + 64) - (19 + 64) = 63. Let me check: 82+64 is 146, 19+64 is 83. 146-83=63. Yes. And all numbers are used once: 82, 64, 19, 64. So that equation uses all four numbers. So that's another valid equation. Which one is better? Both are correct. Maybe the second one is simpler in terms of operations. Let me see if the problem has any restrictions. The problem allows using the operations multiple times, as long as each number is used once. So either equation is acceptable. Let me check the operations. The first equation: (82 - 19) + (64 - 64) uses two subtractions and one addition. The second: (82 +64) - (19 +64) uses two additions and one subtraction. Both are valid. The user probably expects one of these. Let me verify again. The first approach: 82-19=63, 64-64=0, total 63. The second: 82+64=146, 19+64=83, 146-83=63. Both are correct. So either equation works. Which one is more likely the intended answer? Maybe the second one, as it uses all numbers in a more integrated way. The first one just adds zero, which might be considered less elegant. So probably the second one. Let's present that. So the equation is (82 + 64) - (19 + 64) = 63. Let me check again: 82+64 is 146, 19+64 is 83. 146-83 is indeed 63. Yes. That works. So that's a valid equation using all four numbers once. So I can put that as the answer.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(82 + 64) - (19 + 64) = 63</answer>"}]}

I need to use all the numbers 38, 62, 18, and 24 exactly once with basic operations to get 144. Hmm, first, maybe I should think about factors of 144. Since 144 is 12 squared, or 16*9, or 24*6, but I don't have a 6 here. Wait, maybe combining some numbers.\n\nLet me list the numbers again: 38, 62, 18, 24. Let's see, maybe subtract some of the larger numbers. For example, 62 minus 38 is 24. Then I already have 24 in the list. Wait, but I can't reuse numbers. So if I use 62 - 38 = 24, but the original 24 is still there. That might not help directly. Alternatively, maybe multiply 24 by something. 24*6 is 144, but I don't have a 6. How else can I get 6? From 18 divided by 3, but no 3 here.\n\nAlternatively, 62 - 24 = 38. But then I'm left with 38 and 18. Hmm. Let's try combining the numbers in different ways. Let's see:\n\nIf I take 62 and 38. Maybe 62 + 38 = 100. Then 100 + 24 = 124, but that's too low. Then adding 18 gives 142, which is close but not 144.\n\nAlternatively, multiply 62 and 24. 62*24 is 1488, which is way too big. Divided by something? 1488 / 18 is like 82.666, not helpful. Hmm.\n\nWhat if I subtract 18 from 62? 62 -18=44. Then 44* something. 44*3.27=144, but not an integer. Maybe not useful.\n\nWait, maybe using division. Let's see: 24 divided by 18 is 1.333... Maybe not helpful. 62 divided by 38 is about 1.63. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, group numbers into pairs. Let's try possible pairs:\n\nPair 62 and 38: 62-38=24, but then we already have 24. So maybe 24 from 62-38, and then multiply by the other 24 and 18? Wait, but that would be using numbers twice. Not allowed.\n\nAnother approach: maybe 18 multiplied by something. 18*8=144. Do I have an 8? Let's see. 24 divided by 3 is 8. But where do I get 3? 24 divided by 8 is 3. Wait, maybe using 38 and 62 to get 8. 62 - 38 =24. Then 24 /3=8, but that's again using 24 twice. Not allowed.\n\nAlternatively, 62 - (38 + something) = ? Let me see. 62 - 38 =24. Then 24 (from original numbers) plus 18? 24+18=42. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe (62 - 38) * (24 - 18). Let's compute that. 62-38=24, 24-18=6. Then 24*6=144. Oh! Wait, but here's the problem: the original numbers are 38,62,18,24. If I use 62-38=24 (using 62 and 38), then 24-18=6 (using 24 and 18). But then I'm using all four numbers: 62,38,24,18. So the equation would be (62 - 38) * (24 - 18) = 24 * 6 =144. That works! Let me check if I used each number once and all of them. 62,38,24,18 are all used once. Yes. The operations are subtraction and multiplication. So the equation is (62 - 38) * (24 - 18) =144. That should be the answer.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(62 - 38) * (24 - 18) = 144</answer>"}]}

Let's see, 66 times 8 is 528. Wait, 66 × 8 is exactly 528! Oh, that's interesting. But then I need to use both 43s as well. So if I can somehow get 66 multiplied by 8, but also involve the 43s. But since each number can only be used once, how can I do that?\n\nSo maybe I need to combine the 43s with the other numbers in a way that still allows 66 and 8 to be multiplied. Let's think. If I subtract one 43 from the other, 43 - 43 would be 0, which probably isn't helpful. But what if I add them? 43 + 43 is 86. Then 86 multiplied by something? 86 × 6.14… which isn't an integer. Not sure. Wait, 86 × 6.14 would be around 528. Wait, 86 times 6 is 516, and 86 times 6.14 is about 528, but that's using decimals and division maybe. But the problem says to use basic operations, so fractions are allowed as long as they result from division. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe use division with the 43s. Like (43 / 43) is 1. Then 66 × 8 × 1 = 528. That works! So the equation would be 66 × 8 × (43 / 43). Let me check: 43 divided by 43 is 1, then 66×8=528, times 1 is still 528. Yes, that uses all numbers once. So that's the equation. Let me make sure I didn't miss anything else. Are there other possibilities? Maybe, but this seems straightforward. Let me verify the calculation again. 43 divided by 43 is 1. Multiply that by 66 and 8: 66×8=528, and 528×1=528. Perfect. So the equation is (66 × 8) × (43 / 43) = 528. Alternatively, written as 66 * 8 * (43 / 43).

I need to create an equation using the numbers 20, 37, 15, and 6, each exactly once, and combine them with basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) to get 296. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I'll think about the target number, 296. Let me see what operations might get me there. Since 296 is a relatively large number, maybe multiplication is involved. Let's check if multiplying some of these numbers gives a value close to 296.\n\nLooking at the numbers: 37 is the largest. If I multiply 37 by something. Let's see: 37 * 8 is 296, but I don't have an 8. Wait, but maybe I can create 8 using the other numbers. Let's see. The other numbers are 20, 15, and 6. Hmm. Let me think. 15 - 6 is 9, but that's not 8. 20 divided by something... 20 / (15 - 6) = 20 / 9 ≈2.222, which isn't helpful. Alternatively, maybe combining 20 and 15. 20 + 15 is 35, but 35 +6=41. 37*35 is way too big. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 37 * (something) = 296. Let's do 296 divided by 37. Let me calculate: 37*8=296. So 296 = 37 * 8. So, if I can make 8 from the remaining numbers (20, 15, 6). How can I get 8 from those?\n\nLet's see. 20 - 15 =5, then 5 +6=11. Not 8. 15 -6=9. 20 -9=11. Still not. 20 divided by something. 20/(15-6) is 20/9 as before. 15 divided by something: 15/(20-6)=15/14≈1.07. Not helpful. Maybe 20 - (15 -6)=20-9=11. Still no. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe using subtraction and division. Let's see. (20 -6) divided by something. 14 divided by something. If 14 divided by (something) gives 8, then that something would be 14/8=1.75. But the remaining number is 15. Not helpful. Alternatively, 15 - (20/6). Wait, but that would be 15 - 3.333... which is about 11.666. Not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to use division in a different way. Let me think. Let's consider combining 20 and 6. 20*6=120. Then 37* something. 120 is part of the equation. Let's see: 120 +37=157. Then add 15: 172. No. Not close to 296. Alternatively, 37*15=555. Then subtract something. 555 - (20*6)=555-120=435. Still not 296. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 37 * (20 - something). Let's try 20 - (15/6). 15/6=2.5, so 20-2.5=17.5. 37*17.5=647.5, which is too big. Not helpful.\n\nWait, let's try different combinations. Maybe 37 + 20=57. 57*15=855. Then 855 -6=849. No. Not helpful.\n\nHow about 37 * 6=222. Then 222 +20=242. Then 242 +15=257. Still not 296.\n\nAlternatively, 37 * 8=296. So if I can make 8 from 20,15,6. Let me try again. Let's see:\n\n20 - 15 =5. Then 6 +5=11. Not 8. 15 - (20/6). 20/6≈3.333. 15-3.333≈11.666. Not helpful. Maybe (15 -6)=9. Then 20 -9=11. Still no. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe (20 * 6) / (15). Let's compute that. 20*6=120. 120/15=8. Aha! So 20*6=120, then 120 divided by 15 equals 8. Then 37*8=296. So putting it all together: 37 * ( (20 * 6) / 15 ) = 37 * 8 = 296. Let's check if all numbers are used once: 37,20,6,15. Yes, all used once. So the equation would be 37 * (20 * 6 / 15) = 296.\n\nLet me verify the calculation step by step. First, 20 multiplied by 6 is 120. Then 120 divided by 15 is indeed 8. Then 37 multiplied by 8 is 296. Yep, that works. All numbers are used once. So the equation is 37 × ((20 × 6) ÷ 15) = 296. So in symbols, that's 37 * (20 * 6 / 15) = 296. Let me check if the parentheses are necessary. If I write it without parentheses, following order of operations, it would be 37 * 20 * 6 / 15. Let me compute that. 37*20=740, 740*6=4440, 4440/15=296. So even without parentheses, the operations are left to right with multiplication and division. But since multiplication and division have the same precedence, the order from left to right would be 37*20=740, then *6=4440, then /15=296. So the equation can also be written as 37 * 20 * 6 / 15 = 296. Alternatively, using parentheses to group (20 * 6 / 15). Either way, the calculation works. But since we need to use each number once, and all operations are allowed, this works.\n</think>\n\n<answer>37 * 20 * 6 / 15 = 296</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using the numbers 96, 3, 11, and 84 exactly once each, with basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) to get 361. Hmm. Let me start by thinking about how these numbers can combine. \n\nFirst, 361 is a bit of a specific number. Wait, 19 squared is 361, right? So maybe I need to find a way to get 19 and then square it, but wait, we can only use the numbers given once and the operations. Since we don't have an exponentiation operator allowed, unless we create 19 through operations and then multiply it by itself. But that might not be possible here. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, 361 is close to 360, which is 96 * 3.75. But 3.75 is 15/4. Hmm, but do I have numbers to make that? Let me check the numbers I have. The numbers are 96, 3, 11, 84. Maybe I can subtract or add some of these to get 361.\n\nLet me try combining 96 and 84 first. 96 + 84 is 180. That's half of 360. If I multiply that by 2, but I don't have a 2. Alternatively, 96 - 84 is 12. Not too helpful. 96 * 84 is a big number, way over 361. 84 divided by 96 is 0.875. Hmm.\n\nWhat about 3 and 11? 3 * 11 is 33. 11 - 3 is 8. 11 + 3 is 14. Maybe combine these with the other numbers.\n\nLet me try different combinations. Maybe start with 96 * 3 = 288. Then 288 plus something. 288 + 84 = 372. That's 11 over 361. Hmm. 372 - 11 = 361. Wait, that's 96*3 +84 -11. Let's check that: 96*3 is 288, plus 84 is 372, minus 11 is 361. Oh! Wait, that uses all numbers: 96,3,84,11. So the equation would be 96*3 +84 -11. Let me calculate that step by step. 96 multiplied by 3 is 288. 288 plus 84 is 372. 372 minus 11 is indeed 361. So that works! Let me check if all numbers are used once. Yes: 96,3,84,11. Each is used once. The operations are multiplication, addition, and subtraction. So the equation would be (96*3) +84 -11. But parentheses might not be necessary for order of operations since multiplication comes first. So maybe 96*3 +84 -11. Let me confirm the calculation again. 96*3=288. 288+84=372. 372-11=361.

Each number has to be used exactly once, and I can only use basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, 328 is a relatively large number. Let me check the numbers I have. The largest numbers here are 69 and 67, which are both close to 70. Then there's 58, which is a bit lower, and 8, which is the smallest. Since I need to reach 328, maybe I should look for a way to multiply some of the larger numbers together or combine them in a way that their product or sum gets close to 328.\n\nLet me try some combinations. If I multiply 69 by 5, that's 345, which is more than 328. But I don't have a 5. Wait, maybe 69 multiplied by something else. Let's see: 69 * 5 = 345, which is 17 over. If I can get 5 from the other numbers... Hmm, but I have 58, 8, and 67. Let's see, 67 minus 58 is 9, and then 9 minus 8 is 1. Not helpful. Alternatively, 58 divided by 8 is 7.25. Hmm, but that's a decimal. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 67 * 5 = 335, which is 7 over. Again, getting a 5 from other numbers. Let's see, 58 divided by 8 is 7.25. If I subtract that from 67: 67 - 7.25 = 59.75, which isn't helpful. Alternatively, 67 + 8 = 75. Then 75 * 4.4 would be around 328. But I don't have 4.4. Maybe that's not the way.\n\nWait, perhaps combining two large numbers first. For example, 69 + 67 = 136. Then multiplying that by something. 136 * 2.4 is approximately 328. But how to get 2.4 from 58 and 8? 58 divided by 8 is 7.25, which is not 2.4. Alternatively, 8 divided by something. If I have 8 / (something) to get a multiplier. But 8 divided by (58 - 67) would be negative. Not helpful.\n\nAnother angle: maybe 58 * 5.65 is 328. Let me check: 58 * 5 = 290, 58*6=348, so between 5 and 6. But how to get 5.65 from the remaining numbers 8, 69, 67. Let's see: 67 + 8 = 75. 75 divided by 69 is roughly 1.087. That's not 5.65. Alternatively, 69 - 8 = 61. 61 / 67 is about 0.91. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe subtract some numbers. 69 * 5 = 345, then subtract 17 gives 328. How to get 17 from the remaining numbers. Let's see: 67 - 58 = 9. 9 +8 =17. Wait, that works! So if I do 69*5 - (67 -58 +8) = 345 - 17 = 328. But wait, but 5 isn't one of the numbers. Oh, right, I have to use all the numbers: 58,8,69,67. So in this case, the 5 is not part of the original numbers. So that approach doesn't work.\n\nWait, but maybe I can use operations to create the 5. Let's see. For example, if I take 58 - 8 =50. Then 50 divided by 10 is 5. But 10 isn't a number here. Hmm. Alternatively, 67 - something. 67 - (69 - 8) = 67 - 61=6. Not 5.\n\nAlternatively, think about 69 * 4.75 is 328.5, which is close. But getting 4.75 from 67,58,8. Let's see: (67 - 58) + (8 / something). 67-58=9. Then 9 - (8 / something) = 4.75. So 8 / something =4.25. Then something=8/4.25≈1.882. But how to get that from the remaining numbers. Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe another approach. Let's see, 58 * 8 = 464. If I subtract 464 from something else. For example, 69 +67=136. 464 - 136=328. Wait, 58*8 - (69 +67) = 464 -136=328. Oh! That seems to work. Let me check: 58 multiplied by 8 is 464. Then subtract the sum of 69 and 67, which is 136. 464 minus 136 is indeed 328. And all numbers are used: 58,8,69,67. Each used once, and all operations are basic arithmetic. Let me write that equation: 58*8 -69 -67 = 328. Wait, but 58*8 is 464. Then 464 -69=395, 395-67=328. Yes, that's correct. Alternatively, grouping the subtraction as (69 +67), so 58*8 - (69 +67) =328. That's the equation.\n\nLet me verify:\n\n58 *8 = 464\n\n69 +67=136\n\n464 -136=328.\n\nYes! That works. So the equation is 58×8−69−67=328, which can be written with parentheses as 58×8−(69+67)=328 to combine the subtraction. So the answer is (58*8) - (69 + 67) = 328. But I need to check if all numbers are used once. Yes: 58,8,69,67. All are present. Operations used: multiplication, addition, subtraction. That's allowed. So this should be the correct equation.\n</think>\n\n<answer>58*8 - 69 - 67 = 328</answer>\n\nAlternatively, if parentheses are preferred for the sum:\n\n<answer>(58 * 8) - (69 + 67) = 328</answer>\n\nBoth equations are mathematically equivalent. The first version is slightly simpler, but the second uses parentheses to group the addition. Either is acceptable, but the key operations are 58 multiplied by 8, then subtracting the sum of 69 and 67."}]}

Hmm, let's start by thinking about how to combine these numbers. \n\nFirst, 735 is a pretty big number. Let me see what 98 multiplied by something gets close. 98 times 7 is 686, which is under 735. 98 times 7.5 would be 735, but how can I get 7.5 using the remaining numbers 24, 5, 16? Wait, maybe there's another way. Let's see: 98 * (something) = 735. Let me check 735 divided by 98. 98*7=686, 735-686=49, so 49 left. 49 is 98/2, so 7.5 is 7 + 0.5. But how to get 7.5 from 24, 5, 16?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use 24 and 16 together. 24 +16=40. 40 * something. If I use 5, then 40*5=200. 200*98=19600, which is way too big. Not helpful. Hmm.\n\nWait, 735 is 700 + 35. Let's see if I can split the numbers into parts that sum up. For example, 98*5=490. Then maybe 24*16=384. 490+384=874, which is over. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 98*5=490, 24*16=384. 490 + 384 is 874. Then subtract something? But what's left is already used all numbers. So that approach might not work.\n\nAnother thought: 16*5=80. 80* something. 80*9=720. Close to 735. How to get 9 from remaining numbers 24 and 98. 98/24 is about 4.08. Not helpful. Alternatively, 98 -24=74. 74/something. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe 98*(5 + something). Let's see: 5 + 24=29. 98*29=2842. Way too big. 16 is left. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 98*16=1568. Then subtract something. 1568 - (24*5)=1568-120=1448. Still not close.\n\nWait, perhaps using division. Let's see: 98 divided by something. 98/16=6.125. Then multiply by 24*5=120. 6.125*120=735. Oh! Wait, that works. Let me check:\n\n(98 / 16) * (24 * 5). Let's compute that. 98 divided by 16 is 6.125. 24 times 5 is 120. 6.125 multiplied by 120 equals 735. Yes! That works. So the equation would be (98 / 16) * (24 * 5) = 735. Let me verify all numbers are used: 98, 16, 24, 5. Yes, each once. And all operations are allowed.

I need to create an equation using all the numbers 13, 16, 60, and 53 exactly once, with basic arithmetic operations, to get 142. Hmm. Let me start by thinking about possible combinations.\n\nFirst, 142 is a relatively large number, so maybe multiplication or addition would be involved. Let me check what 60 multiplied by something gives. 60*2 is 120, which is less than 142. 60*3 is 180, which is too big. So maybe 60 plus something. 60 + 53 is 113, which is still low. 60 + 53 + 16 would be 60+53=113, 113+16=129. Then add 13? 129+13=142. Wait, but that uses all numbers with only addition. Let me check: 60 + 53 + 16 +13. Wait, 60+53 is 113, plus 16 is 129, plus 13 is 142. But that's just adding all of them. Wait, but 60+53=113, 16+13=29, and 113+29=142. So that's (60 + 53) + (16 +13) = 113 +29=142. Oh! So the equation would be (60 + 53) + (16 +13) =142. But does that use each number once and all of them? Yes. Let me check: 60,53,16,13 all used once, and added together. But wait, does that count? Because the problem says \"using each number once\" and \"basic arithmetic operations one or multiple times\". So if I just add them all, that's allowed. So the equation would be 60 + 53 +16 +13 =142. But let me check the arithmetic again. 60+53 is 113, 16+13 is 29. 113+29=142. Correct. So this works. But maybe the problem expects some operations other than just adding all. Let me see if there's another way, maybe combining multiplication or division to make it more complex. But if this works, then that's a valid answer. Let me verify again. The numbers 13,16,60,53. Adding them all: 13+16=29, 53+60=113. 29+113=142. So yes. So the equation is 60 +53 +16 +13 =142. But the problem might want parentheses, but maybe not necessary. Alternatively, using multiplication. Let's see. Suppose I use multiplication. For example, 53 is close to 60. 60 -53=7. Then 16 -13=3. 7*3=21. Doesn't help. Hmm. Alternatively, 16*13=208. Then 60+53=113. 208-113=95. Not 142. 16*60=960. That's way too big. 53-13=40. 40+16=56. 56* something? 60? 56*2=112. Not helpful. Maybe division. 60 divided by something. 60/16=3.75. Then 53*3.75=198.75, minus 13=185.75. Not helpful. Another approach: 53*2=106. How to get 2? 16/(13- something). Not sure. Alternatively, 60-16=44. Then 44*3=132, plus 10=142. But where to get 3 and 10. Maybe 53-44=9. Not sure. Let me try another way. 16*60=960. Then subtract 53*13=689. 960-689=271. Not close. Hmm. Maybe 53*2 + 16 +60. But 53*2 is 106, plus 16=122, plus60=182. Too high. Alternatively, 53+60=113, 16* something. 16*2=32. 113+32=145. Close to 142. 145-3=142. Where's the 3? 13-10=3. But where's 10? Maybe not. Alternatively, 16* (60/ something) +53. 60/13 is approximately 4.6. 16*4.6=73.6 +53=126.6. Not enough. Alternatively, 53 -13=40. 40* something. 40*3=120, plus 16=136, plus something. 60 is left. Wait, but 53-13=40, then 60-16=44. 40+44=84. No. Hmm. Another idea: 60 + (53 - 16) +13. Let's see: 60 +37=97 +13=110. No. Alternatively, (60 -16)=44. Then 53 +13=66. 44+66=110. Still not. Hmm. Maybe 60 + (53 - (16 -13)). Let's compute 16-13=3, then 53-3=50. 60+50=110. No. Hmm. Let's try multiplying. 16*53=848. Then 848 divided by something. 848/60≈14.13. Not helpful. Or 60*13=780. Then 780 -53=727, -16=711. No. 53*13=689. 689 +16=705, -60=645. Not helpful. Hmm. Maybe subtraction somewhere. Let's see. 60 +53=113. 16*13=208. 208 -113=95. Not helpful. Alternatively, 53*2=106. 106 +60=166. 166-16=150. 150-13=137. Not 142. Alternatively, 60 +53=113. 113 +16=129. 129 +13=142. Oh, wait! That's the same as before. So that's just adding all the numbers. So the equation is 13 +16 +60 +53 =142. Wait, but 13+16 is 29, 60+53 is 113. 29+113=142. So yes, that works. So maybe the simplest answer is just adding all the numbers. Let me check again: 13+16=29, 60+53=113, 29+113=142. Correct. So the equation is 13 +16 +60 +53 =142. But do I need to use parentheses? Like (13 +16) + (60 +53). But maybe not necessary. Alternatively, 60 +53 +16 +13. Either way, it's correct. Since the problem allows using operations multiple times, and each number once. So this seems valid. So maybe that's the answer. I'll go with that.\n</think>\n\n<answer>13 + 16 + 53 + 60 = 142</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using the numbers 75, 14, 6, and 158 exactly once each, with basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) to get 886. Hmm, 886 is a pretty big number, so maybe multiplication is involved here. Let me think about how these numbers can combine.\n\nFirst, let me check the largest numbers: 158 and 75. If I multiply those two, 158*75, that would be a big number. Let me calculate that. 150*75 is 11,250, and 8*75 is 600, so together that's 11,850. Wait, 158*75 is 11,850. But 11,850 is way bigger than 886. So maybe that's not the right approach. Maybe I need to subtract something from that product. But 11,850 minus something would still be way higher than 886. Maybe I should use division to bring it down?\n\nAlternatively, maybe combining 158 with another number. Let's see. 158*6 is 948. That's closer to 886. So 948 minus something. The remaining numbers are 75 and 14. 948 - 75 = 873, then 873 -14 = 859. Not enough. Hmm. What if I do 158*6 + something. 158*6 is 948. 948 + something would be over, but 886 is less than 948. So maybe subtract. 948 - (75 +14) = 948 -89 = 859. Still not 886.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 75*14. Let's calculate that. 75*14 is 1,050. Then 1,050 minus 158 is 892. Close to 886. Then subtract 6. 892 -6 = 886. Wait, that works! Let me check:\n\n75 * 14 = 1,050. Then 1,050 - 158 = 892. Then 892 - 6 = 886. But wait, the numbers used would be 75,14,158,6. That's all four numbers. Each used once. So the equation would be 75*14 - 158 -6 = 886. Let me verify:\n\n75 *14: 70*14=980, 5*14=70, so total 980+70=1050. 1050-158=1050-150=900, 900-8=892. Then 892-6=886. Yes! That works. So the equation is (75 × 14) - 158 - 6 = 886. But do I need to format it with parentheses? Let me check if the operations order is correct. Multiplication comes first, so 75*14 is first, then subtract 158, then subtract 6. So the equation is 75*14 -158 -6 = 886. That should be correct. Let me double-check all numbers: 75,14,6,158. All used once. Great.\n</think>\n\n<answer>75 * 14 - 158 - 6 = 886</answer>"}]}

I need to make an equation using all the numbers 30, 24, 10, and 35 exactly once, combining them with basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) to get 43. Hmm, let's start by thinking about possible combinations.\n\nFirst, 43 is a prime number, so maybe addition or subtraction could be part of the solution. Let's look at the numbers: 30, 24, 10, 35. The largest number is 35, so maybe if I subtract something from 35 to get closer to 43. Wait, 35 is smaller than 43, so that's not helpful. Alternatively, adding 35 and 10 gives 45, which is close to 43. Then maybe subtract 2? But I don't have a 2. Hmm. Alternatively, 35 + (something) =43. So 43-35=8. So I need to make 8 with 30, 24, and 10. But that's three numbers, and I can only use each once. Let's see: 30, 24, 10. How can I combine these to get 8? 30 - 24 =6, then 6 + 10=16. No. 24 - (30/10) =24-3=21. Not 8. 30/10=3, 24-3=21. Still not. Maybe 24/(30/10)=24/3=8. Oh, that's possible! Let me check. 30 divided by 10 is 3, then 24 divided by 3 is 8. So then 35 + 8 =43. So putting it all together: 35 + (24 / (30 /10)) =35 + (24/3)=35+8=43. Let me verify each number is used once: 35, 24, 30, 10. Yes, all are used once. Operations are division inside the parentheses and then addition. That should work. Let me write it out: 35 + 24/(30/10) =43. Let me check the calculation again. 30 divided by 10 is 3, then 24 divided by 3 is 8. 35 plus 8 is 43. Exactly. So that's the equation. Wait, is there another way? Maybe, but this seems to work. Let me make sure there's no error here. All numbers used once, operations allowed. Yep, looks good.\n</think>\n\n<answer>35 + 24 / (30 / 10) = 43</answer>"}]}

If I subtract something from 85, maybe that could help. But 85 - 66 = 19, which doesn't seem helpful. Alternatively, adding 85 and 66 gives 151, which is just 1 more than 150. Close, but not there. Hmm.\n\nWait, 85 + 66 = 151. If I could subtract 1 from that, I'd get 150. But do I have a way to make 1 with the remaining numbers 8 and 9? Let's see. 9 - 8 = 1. So maybe (85 + 66) - (9 - 8) = 151 - 1 = 150. Let me check: 85 +66 is 151, then subtract (9-8)=1, so 151-1=150. That works! Let me verify if I used all numbers: 85, 66, 9, 8. Yes, all used once. So the equation would be 85 + 66 - (9 - 8) = 150. Or written with parentheses as (85 + 66) - (9 - 8) = 150. Let me make sure that's correct. 9-8 is 1, then 151-1=150. Perfect.

I need to use the numbers 7, 98, 12, and 7 to create an equation that equals 86. All numbers must be used exactly once, and I can only use basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice there are two 7s. Since each number can only be used once, maybe I can combine them somehow. Wait, but how? If I add them together, that would be 7 + 7 = 14. Then I have 14, 98, and 12 left. Or maybe subtract them: 7 - 7 = 0, which might not be helpful. Alternatively, multiplying them: 7 * 7 = 49. Let me write down possible combinations.\n\nLet me list out the numbers again: 7, 98, 12, 7. Need to use all four. Let's see, 98 is a large number, so maybe I can subtract something from it to get down to 86. 98 minus 12 is 86, but then I would still have the two 7s left. But I have to use all numbers. So maybe 98 - (something involving 12 and the two 7s) =86. But that seems tricky because if I subtract 12, that's 98-12=86, but then I need to use the two 7s. Wait, perhaps I can combine the two 7s with another number. For example, 12 - (7 +7) =12-14= -2. Then 98 - (-2) =100. Not helpful. Alternatively, 12/(7/7) =12/1=12. Then 98 -12=86. Oh, wait! That uses all numbers. Let me check:\n\n98 - (12 / (7 /7)) = 98 - (12 /1) =98-12=86. But how does that use all numbers? Let's see: 7 divided by 7 is 1, then 12 divided by 1 is 12. Then 98 minus 12 is 86. So the equation would be 98 - (12 / (7 /7)) =86. But does that use all four numbers? Yes: 98, 12, 7, 7. Each used once. That works! Let me verify the operations:\n\nFirst, compute the innermost parentheses: 7 /7 =1. Then 12 /1=12. Then 98 -12=86. Exactly. So the equation is 98 - (12 / (7 /7)) =86.

Each number once, and I can use +, -, *, / as needed. Hmm. Let's start by thinking about what operations might get me close to 125.\n\nFirst, maybe subtract some of the larger numbers. For example, 89 is close to 125. If I subtract something from 89, maybe? 125 - 89 is 36. So I need to get 36 from the remaining numbers: 34, 77, 79. Wait, but 34 is there. 34 plus 2 is 36, but I don't have a 2. Alternatively, 77 minus 79 is -2, but that might not help. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, what if I add 77 and 79? That's 156. Then subtract something. 156 - 34 = 122. Close to 125 but not quite. Hmm. Alternatively, 77 + 89 is 166. Then 166 - 34 is 132. Still not 125. Maybe multiply some numbers? Let's see. 77 divided by 34 is around 2.26, but I'm not sure how that helps. \n\nWait, maybe combine division and addition. For example, 89 + (77/34) is approximately 89 + 2.26 = 91.26. That's not helpful. \n\nWhat if I subtract two numbers? 79 - 34 = 45. Then 45 + 77 = 122. Still missing by 3. Then 122 + 89 is way over. Maybe not the right approach.\n\nAnother idea: Let's see if 125 can be expressed as a combination of two numbers. Like 79 + 46 = 125. But how to get 46 from 34, 77, 89. 89 - 34 = 55. 55 - 9 = 46, but where's the 9? Alternatively, 77 - 34 = 43. 43 + 3 = 46, but again no 3.\n\nWait, maybe using division. If I take 77 divided by something. Let's see, 77 / 34 is about 2.26. If I subtract that from 89? 89 - (77/34) ≈ 89 - 2.26 ≈ 86.74. Not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, maybe multiply 34 by something. 34 * 3 = 102, but I don't have a 3. Maybe 34 * (something) to get a higher number. Hmm.\n\nWait, let's try combining 89 and 34 first. 89 + 34 = 123. Then I need 2 more. How? The remaining numbers are 77 and 79. 79 - 77 = 2. So 123 + (79 -77) = 123 +2=125. That works! Let me check:\n\nSo, 89 +34 + (79 -77) = 123 +2 =125. But wait, are all numbers used? 89, 34,79,77. Yes, each once. So the equation would be (89 +34) + (79 -77) =125. But the way the problem is phrased, you have to use all numbers with operations, maybe grouped appropriately. Let me make sure. Let's write it as:\n\n89 + 34 + 79 -77 =125. Because 89 +34 is 123, then +79 is 202, then -77 is 125. Wait, wait, 89+34=123, 123+79=202, 202-77=125. Yes. So the equation is 89 + 34 +79 -77 =125. But all numbers are used once, and operations are addition and subtraction. That should work. Let me check again:\n\n89 +34 =123. 123 +79=202. 202-77=125. Yes. So that's valid. So the equation is (89 +34 +79) -77 =125, but since addition is associative, maybe written as 89 +34 +79 -77 =125. Alternatively, group the 79 -77 first. Like 89 +34 + (79 -77) =125. Either way, it's correct. So maybe the simplest way is to write it as 89 +34 +79 -77 =125. Let me check if that uses all numbers once. Yes: 89,34,79,77. All used once. So that's the answer.\n</think>\n\n<answer>89 + 34 + 79 - 77 = 125</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using all the numbers 55, 50, 94, and 8 exactly once, with basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) to get 584. Hmm. Let me start by thinking about what combinations could lead to 584.\n\nFirst, 584 is a fairly large number. Let me check if multiplying some of the larger numbers might get close. For example, 55 multiplied by something. Let's see: 55 * 10 is 550, which is close but not enough. If I can get 55 multiplied by 10.6, that would be 583, but that's not an integer. Wait, maybe adding or subtracting other numbers could adjust it.\n\nAlternatively, 50 times 11.68 is 584, but again, not sure. Let's try combining 94 and 8 first. 94 times 8 is 752. That's a big number. Maybe subtract something from that. 752 minus 55 is 697, which is still too big. 752 minus 50 is 702. Hmm. Not helpful.\n\nWhat if I divide 94 by 8? That's about 11.75. Then multiply by 50: 50*11.75 is 587.5. Close to 584, but not exact. Maybe subtract 55? Wait, but 587.5 minus 55 is 532.5. Not quite. Alternatively, maybe 94 divided by something else. Wait, maybe arrange operations differently.\n\nAnother approach: Let's think of 55 and 50. If I subtract them, 55 - 50 = 5. Then multiply by something. 5 * 94 = 470. Add 8: 478. No, not enough. Alternatively, 55 + 50 = 105. Then 105 * 5.6 is 588. Hmm. Not helpful.\n\nWait, 94 is a big number. Let's see. 94 * (55 - 50) would be 94 *5 =470. Then add 8: 478. Still low. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 55 * (something). Let me try 55*10=550. If I can get 10 from the other numbers. 50 divided by (94-8) is 50/86≈0.581, which is not helpful. Wait, 94 - (8/50) is 94 -0.16=93.84. Multiply by 55: 55*93.84=5161.2. Way too big.\n\nWhat if I do 55*50=2750. That's way over. Then subtract 94 and 8: 2750 -94 -8=2648. Not helpful. So that's not the way.\n\nWait, maybe 94*8=752. Then 752 minus (55+50)=752-105=647. Still not 584. Hmm. How about 752 - (55* something). 55*3=165, 752-165=587. Close. 587 is 3 more than 584. Maybe using division. Wait, 55 divided by something. If I have 752 - (55*(something)). Let's see: 752 - 55*3 = 752 - 165=587. Then subtract 3 more. But I need to use 50 and 8. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, 94* (8 + (55/50)). Let's compute 55/50=1.1. 8+1.1=9.1. 94*9.1=855.4. Not helpful.\n\nWait, 50*8=400. Then 400 + 94=494. Then 494 + 55=549. No, too low.\n\nAnother angle: 584 divided by 8 is 73. So maybe if I can get 73 using 55, 50, 94, then multiply by 8. Wait, but 8 is already used. Wait, but we have to use all numbers. So if 8 is part of the equation as a multiplier, maybe.\n\nWait, let's see: 55 + 50 =105. 105 +94=199. 199* something. 199*3=597. Close to 584. But 584 is 597 minus 13. But how to get 13 from remaining numbers. Wait, but we have to use all numbers, so maybe that's not the path.\n\nAlternatively, 55*10=550, 550 + 34=584. How to get 34 from 50,94,8. 94 divided by (something) minus something. Let's see, 94 - (50 +8) = 94-58=36. Close to 34. 36-2=34, but where does the 2 come from?\n\nAlternatively, 50 - (8* something). 50- (8*2)=34. But 8*2 is 16, so 50-16=34. Then 55*10 +34=550+34=584. But here, 10 would come from where? Wait, but the numbers we have left are 94. Wait, maybe 94 divided by 8 is 11.75. Then 50- (94/8)=50-11.75=38.25. Then 55*38.25=2103.75. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe (55 + 50) * (94 /8). Let's compute that. 105 * 11.75= 1233.75. No. Not close.\n\nHmm. Maybe subtraction. Let's think of 55*8=440. Then 440 + something. 584-440=144. So need 144 from 50 and 94. 94+50=144. Yes! So 55*8 + 50 +94=440 +50+94=584. Wait, but that uses all numbers: 55,8 (as 55*8), then 50 and 94 added. Let me check: 55*8=440. 440+50=490. 490+94=584. Yes! But wait, that uses addition three times. So the equation would be 55*8 +50 +94 =584. But does that use each number exactly once? Let me check: 55, 8, 50, 94 are all used once. Yes. So that's possible. So the equation is (55 × 8) + 50 + 94 = 584. Wait, but maybe parentheses are not needed, but using the numbers once each. Let me verify: 55*8=440, 440+50=490, 490+94=584. Yes! That works. All numbers are used once. So the equation is 55×8 +50 +94 =584. But maybe written with parentheses for clarity: (55×8) +50 +94. But the order of operations would handle the multiplication first anyway. So that's a valid equation. Wait, that seems straightforward. Did I miss that earlier? Probably because I was overcomplicating. So the answer is (55 * 8) + 50 + 94 = 584. Let me check again: 55*8 is 440. Then 440+50 is 490. 490+94 is 584. Correct. All numbers used once. Operations are + and *. Yes. That's it.\n</think>\n\n<answer>55 * 8 + 50 + 94 = 584</answer>"}]}

The largest numbers here are 85 and 64. If I add those together, 85 + 64 = 149. That's only halfway. Maybe multiplying them? 85 * 64 is way too big, like 5440. That's not helpful. So maybe adding isn't the way to go. Let's think about other operations.\n\nWhat if I subtract? 85 - 64 = 21. That's too small. Not helpful. Maybe multiply a larger number with one of the smaller ones. Let's see, 85 * 5 is 425. Then maybe subtract 64 and add 10? Wait, 425 - 64 = 361, plus 10 is 371. Not 298. Alternatively, 85 * 10 = 850. That's way over. Maybe divide somewhere.\n\nWait, 85 * 5 is 425. If I take 425 and subtract something. Let's see, 425 - (64 + 10) = 425 -74=351. Still not 298. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, 64 * 5 = 320. Then 320 minus something. If I use 85 and 10, maybe 320 - (85 -10) = 320 -75=245. No. Or 320 -85 +10= 245 again. Not 298.\n\nWait, what if I do 64 * 5 =320. Then 320 - (85 /10). Let's calculate that. 85/10 is 8.5, so 320 -8.5=311.5. Still not 298.\n\nHmm. Maybe combining operations in a different order. Let's think about 85 and 10. 85 * 10 is 850. Then 850 divided by something. If I divide by 5, that's 170. Then 170 +64=234. No. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 85 * (10 -5) =85*5=425. Then 425 -64=361. Still not.\n\nWait, maybe use division in a way that reduces a larger number. For example, 64 / 5 is 12.8. Then 85 *12.8 is... let me calculate. 85*12=1020, 85*0.8=68, so total 1088. Then minus 10 would be 1078. Way too big.\n\nHmm. Maybe I need to combine two operations. Let's think, 85 +64=149. Then 149 *2=298. Wait, 149*2 is exactly 298. But how do I get a 2 from the remaining numbers 10 and 5? Oh! 10 divided by 5 is 2. So maybe (85 +64) * (10 /5) =149*2=298. That uses all numbers: 85,64,10,5 with operations +, *, and /. Let me check. Yes, 10 divided by 5 is 2. Then 149 times 2 is 298. Perfect! So the equation would be (85 + 64) * (10 / 5) =298.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(85 + 64) * (10 / 5) = 298</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using the numbers 112, 83, 474, and 7, each exactly once, and combine them with basic operations to get 227. Hmm. Let's start by thinking about the target number, 227. It's a prime number, so maybe subtraction or division could be involved. But since the numbers given are quite large (like 474 and 112), maybe I can find a way to subtract or divide them to get closer.\n\nFirst, I'll list out all the numbers: 112, 83, 474, 7. All must be used once. Let me think about possible combinations. Maybe start with the largest number, 474. If I subtract something from 474 to get close to 227. 474 - 227 = 247. So I need to get 247 from the other numbers. Wait, but the remaining numbers are 112, 83, and 7. Let's see: 112 + 83 = 195, plus 7 is 202. That's not 247. Alternatively, 112 * 83 is way too big. 83 * 7 is 581. 474 - 581 would be negative, which isn't helpful. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe division. If I divide 474 by something to get near 227. 474 divided by 2 is 237, which is close. But how do I get 2 from the other numbers? 7 - (112/83) ? That's messy. Not sure. Alternatively, 474 divided by (something) equals 227, but 474 / 227 is approximately 2.088, which isn't a number I can make with the remaining numbers. Maybe that's not the way.\n\nWhat if I use multiplication? 83 * 7 is 581. Then 581 - 474 is 107. That's not enough. 112 + 107 is 219, still not 227. Not helpful.\n\nAnother approach: Combine 112 and 7 first. 112 divided by 7 is 16. Then 16 * 83 is 1328. Then 1328 - 474 = 854. Not close. Hmm. Or 112 + 7 = 119. 119 * 2 is 238, but again, how to get 2? Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe 474 - (112 + 83) = 474 - 195 = 279. Then 279 - 7 = 272. Still not 227. Hmm.\n\nHow about 474 - (83 * something). Let's see. 83 * 3 is 249. 474 - 249 = 225. Close to 227. How can I get 3 from 112 and 7? 112 divided by 7 is 16. Not 3. Wait, 7 - (112 / 83) is 7 - 1.349 ≈ 5.65. Not helpful. Alternatively, 83 - (474 / 7) would be 83 - 67.714 ≈ 15.285. Not useful.\n\nAnother thought: 474 divided by 7 is around 67.714. If I subtract that from 83, 83 - 67.714 ≈15.286. Then multiply by 112? 15.286 * 112 ≈ 1712, which is way over. No.\n\nWait, perhaps 112 - 83 = 29. Then 29 * 7 = 203. 203 + 474 = 677. Not helpful. Or 474 - 203 = 271. Still not.\n\nMaybe 474 - 112 = 362. Then 362 - 83 = 279. 279 - 7 = 272. Nope.\n\nAlternatively, 474 / 7 is approximately 67.714. Then 112 + 83 = 195. 195 - 67.714 ≈ 127.286. Not 227.\n\nWait, perhaps combining operations in a different order. Let's try using parentheses differently. For example, 83 * 7 = 581. Then 581 - 474 = 107. Then 112 + 107 = 219. Still 8 short.\n\nOr 474 - 112 = 362. Then 362 - (83 +7) = 362 -90=272. Close but not quite.\n\nHmm. Maybe multiplication and division. Let's see: 112 * 7 = 784. Then 784 - 474 = 310. 310 -83=227. Wait, that's 112*7=784. 784-474=310. 310-83=227. Oh! That uses all numbers: 112*7=784, minus 474, minus 83. Let's check:\n\n112 * 7 = 784\n\n784 - 474 = 310\n\n310 - 83 = 227\n\nYes! But wait, the numbers used would be 112,7,474,83. All four numbers, each once. So the equation would be 112*7 - 474 -83 = 227. Let me compute that again to confirm.\n\n112 *7 is 784. 784 -474 is 310. 310 -83 is 227. Exactly. So the equation is (112 * 7) - 474 -83 = 227. Alternatively, written as 112*7 -474 -83. But does that use all numbers once? Yes: 112,7,474,83. All four numbers. Each used once. So that works.\n</think>\n\n<answer>112 * 7 - 474 - 83 = 227</answer>"}]}

I need to use all the numbers 35, 20, 7, and 58 exactly once each with basic arithmetic operations to get 50. Hmm. Let's start by thinking about possible combinations.\n\nFirst, maybe I can look for numbers that can combine to make a round number. Like 35 and 20. If I subtract them, 35 - 20 is 15. But then I have 7 and 58 left. Not sure how that helps. Alternatively, 35 + 20 is 55. That's closer to 50. Then maybe subtract something? 55 - something equals 50. So that something would be 5. How to get 5 from 7 and 58? Hmm, 58 divided by 7 is roughly 8.28, which doesn't help. 7 minus (58 divided by something else...). Wait, maybe not that way.\n\nWhat if I try combining 58 and 7 first? 58 minus 7 is 51. Then maybe subtract 1 to get 50. But where do I get 1 from? I have 35 and 20 left. 35 minus 20 is 15. Not helpful. Alternatively, 20 divided by (something). 20 divided by 20 is 1, but that's using 20 again. Wait, but we can only use each number once. So maybe that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, 58 divided by something. 58 divided by 7 is about 8.28. Then maybe multiply or add. Let's see. 35 + 20 is 55. If I subtract (58/7), which is approximately 8.28, 55 - 8.28 is about 46.72. Not 50. Not helpful.\n\nWhat if I do 35 multiplied by something? 35 * 20 is 700, way too big. 35 * 7 is 245. Then subtract 58? 245 -58 is 187. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe using division in a clever way. For example, (35 - (58 / (20 -7))). Let's check that. 20 -7 is 13. Then 58 divided by 13 is approximately 4.46. Then 35 -4.46 is around 30.54. Not 50.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (58 - 35) is 23. Then 23 + 20 =43. Then add 7 is 50. Wait, that uses all numbers: 58 -35 =23, 23+20=43, 43+7=50. But that's three operations and uses each number once. Wait, let's write it as (58 -35) + 20 +7. But does that follow the order? Wait, the problem says you can use the operations multiple times but each number once. So if I do (58 -35) which is 23, then add 20 gives 43, then add 7 gives 50. So the equation would be 58 -35 +20 +7 =50. But does that use all numbers once? Yes: 58,35,20,7 each used once. The operations are subtraction and addition. So that's a possible solution.\n\nWait, let me check that. 58-35 is 23, 23+20 is 43, 43+7 is 50. Yes. So the equation is 58 - 35 + 20 + 7 =50. But the problem requires using each number once and all of them. That works. But wait, the way the equation is structured, do I need parentheses? Because addition and subtraction are left associative. So writing it as ((58 -35) +20) +7, but without parentheses it's the same. So maybe 58 -35 +20 +7. Let's compute that step by step:\n\n58 -35 =23\n\n23 +20 =43\n\n43 +7 =50.\n\nYes, that works. So that's a valid equation using all numbers once. But let me check if I can find another way, maybe with multiplication or division to see if there's another possibility.\n\nFor instance, 20 divided by something. 20 / (7 - (58 -35))? Let's see: 58 -35 is 23. Then 7 -23 is -16. Then 20 divided by -16 is -1.25. Not helpful.\n\nOr maybe 35 * something. Let's see, 35 * (20 / (58 -7)). 58-7=51. 20/51 is about 0.39. 35*0.39≈13.7. Not 50.\n\nAlternatively, (35 +7) =42. Then 58 - (42 -20). 42-20=22. 58-22=36. Not 50.\n\nWait, another approach: 58 - (35 - (20 /7)). Let's compute that. 20/7≈2.857. 35 -2.857≈32.143. 58 -32.143≈25.857. Not 50.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, 35 + 20 =55. Then 55 - (58/7). 58/7≈8.285. 55 -8.285≈46.715. Not 50.\n\nWhat if I do 20 *7 =140. Then 58 -35=23. 140 -23=117. Not 50.\n\nWait, maybe 58 - (35 /7) +20. Let's calculate: 35/7=5. 58-5=53. 53+20=73. Not 50.\n\nAlternatively, (58 +20) - (35 +7). 58+20=78. 35+7=42. 78-42=36. Not 50.\n\nWait another idea: 35 + (58 -20)/7. Let's see. 58-20=38. 38/7≈5.428. 35+5.428≈40.428. Not 50.\n\nHmm. Let me check again the initial solution: 58-35+20+7. That gives 50. That uses all numbers once. So that's valid. Is there a way to structure it with parentheses? For example, (58 -35) + (20 +7). Which is 23 +27=50. Yes. So the equation can be written as (58 - 35) + 20 +7 =50. That's the same as the previous one, just grouped differently. Since addition is associative, it's the same result.\n\nTherefore, this seems to work. Let me verify once more to make sure:\n\n58 -35 =23\n\n20 +7=27\n\n23 +27=50\n\nYes. So combining these steps: (58 -35) + (20 +7) =50. So the equation would be (58 -35) + 20 +7 =50. But technically, the parentheses around 58-35 are necessary if we want to group them first, but since addition and subtraction are left-associative, without parentheses it would still evaluate the same way. However, including parentheses might make it clearer. So the answer could be written as (58 - 35) + 20 + 7.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects some multiplication or division, but since the straightforward solution works, that's acceptable.\n\nSo I think this is the correct equation.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(58 - 35) + 20 + 7 = 50</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using the numbers 95, 5, 95, and 23, each exactly once, with basic arithmetic operations, and the result should be 115. Hmm. Let's start by listing out all the numbers and thinking about possible combinations.\n\nFirst, 115 is the target. Let me think about how to get there. Since there are two 95s, maybe using subtraction or division with those could help. Let's see:\n\nIf I subtract two numbers, 95 - 95 would be zero, but that's not helpful. Maybe adding them? 95 + 95 is 190. Then I have 5 and 23 left. How can I get from 190 to 115 using 5 and 23? Maybe subtract something. Let's see: 190 - (something) = 115. So the something would need to be 75. Wait, 5 and 23. How to get 75 from 5 and 23? 23*3 is 69, but that's not helpful. 23*5 is 115, which is more than 75. Hmm. Maybe division? 23/5 is 4.6. Not helpful. Maybe 5* (23 - something). But we don't have other numbers left. So that approach might not work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using one of the 95s and 23. Let's see: 95 + 23 is 118. Then we have 5 and 95 left. 118 plus 5 is 123, which is too high. If we subtract 5 from 118, that's 113. Close to 115, but not quite. Or 95 minus 23 is 72. Then adding 5 gives 77. Still not 115. \n\nWait, maybe we can multiply some numbers. Let's try 23*5=115. Oh, but that's exactly the target number. But we have to use all numbers. So if I do 23*5=115, then what about the two 95s? We need to use them. But since we can only use each number once, maybe we can subtract 95 and add 95 in some way that cancels out? Wait, but that would be 23*5 +95 -95=115 +0=115. But does that work? Let me check. The equation would be (23 * 5) + 95 - 95. But that uses 23,5,95,95. Yes, each number once. Because there are two 95s. So that's allowed. But wait, the problem says each number can be used once, and you have to use all of them. So since there are two 95s in the original list, each of them is used once here. So maybe that's acceptable. Let me check the problem statement again: \"each number can only be used once, and you must use all the numbers.\" So since there are two 95s, each is used once. So the equation would be (23 * 5) + 95 - 95 = 115. Let's compute that: 23*5 is 115. Then adding 95 gives 210, then subtracting 95 gives 115. Yes, that works. But wait, the problem says \"create an equation that equals 115\" using all numbers once. So this would be 23*5 +95 -95 = 115. That uses all four numbers: 23,5, and the two 95s. That seems to fit. Let me verify the arithmetic: 23*5=115. Then 115 +95=210. 210-95=115. Yes. So that works. \n\nIs there another way? Let me see if there's a different approach. Maybe using division. For example, 95 divided by something. 95/5 is 19. Then adding 95 and 23? 19 +95=114, plus 23=137. No. Or 95/5=19, then 19 +23=42, then 42 +95=137. No. Not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, 95 - (something). Let's say 95 - (23 -5) =95 -18=77. Then adding the other 95 gives 172. Not helpful. \n\nAnother idea: 95 + (23 -5) = 95 +18=113. Then the other 95 is left. 113 +95=208. Not close. \n\nWait, maybe subtract and add. Let's think of combining the two 95s. If I do 95 -95=0, then I have 5 and 23 left. 5*23=115. Then 0 +115=115. But how to structure that. The equation would be (95 -95) + (23*5)=0 +115=115. That uses all numbers: 95,95,23,5. Each once. So that's another valid equation. But the problem allows using operations multiple times, so addition and multiplication here. \n\nAlternatively, (23 *5) + (95 -95) =115 +0=115. Either way, the same result. So both equations are valid. \n\nI think this is the most straightforward solution. Let me check if there are other possibilities. For example, using division. Suppose 95 divided by something. 95 /5=19. Then 19 + (95 -23)=19+72=91. Not enough. Or 95/(23-5)=95/18≈5.277. Not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, (95 *5) - (95 +23)=475 -118=357. Too big. \n\nHow about (95 +23) - (5* something)? 95+23=118. 118 - (5*x)=115. So 5x=3. But x would have to be 3/5, which isn't possible with the remaining numbers. \n\nAlternatively, 95 + (23 -5) =113. Then adding the other 95 would be 208. No. \n\nHmm. So the only way I can see is using 23*5=115 and then adding and subtracting the two 95s. So that's the equation: 23*5 +95 -95 =115. Which simplifies to 115 +0=115. That works. \n\nTherefore, the equation should be (23 × 5) + 95 − 95 = 115. But written with the numbers in order, maybe? The problem doesn't specify the order, just that each number is used once. So this works. Let me check if that's allowed. Yes, the problem says you can use the operations multiple times but each number once. So this should be acceptable.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(23 * 5) + 95 - 95 = 115</answer>"}]}

Let's see what factors 172 has. Well, 172 divided by 4 is 43, right? Because 4 times 43 is 172. Wait, that's interesting because 43 is one of the numbers I have. So if I can get 4 from the remaining numbers (47, 94, 8), then maybe 43 multiplied by 4 would work. But how can I make 4 from 47, 94, and 8?\n\nWait, let's check the numbers again. The numbers are 43, 47, 94, 8. So if I use 43, then I need to use the other three to make 4. Let's see. Let's see, 94 divided by something. 94 divided by 47 is 2. Then 8 minus 2 is 6. Hmm, that might not help. Or maybe 47 minus (94 divided by something). Wait, 94 divided by 47 is 2. Then 8 minus 2 is 6. Not 4. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 8 divided by (something). Let's think. If I take 47 and 94, maybe 94 minus 47 is 47. Then 8 divided by (94 -47) would be 8/47, which is less than 1. Not helpful. Alternatively, 47 - (94/8) would be 47 - 11.75 = 35.25, which also doesn't help. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using subtraction. Let's see, 94 - 47 is 47. Then 47 - 8 is 39. Still not 4. Hmm. Maybe multiplication. 47 * 8 is 376, which is way too big. 94 * 8 is 752. That's way too big. Maybe division here. 94 divided by 8 is 11.75. Then 47 minus 11.75 is 35.25. Still not useful.\n\nWait, maybe another approach. Let's think about 94 and 8. 94 divided by something. If I divide 94 by 47, that's 2. Then 8 minus that 2 is 6. Then 43 times 6 would be 258, which is not 172. Not helpful. Alternatively, if I take 94 divided by 8, that's 11.75. Then 47 minus 11.75 is 35.25, and then 43 plus that is 78.25. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe multiply 43 and 47 first. 43*47 is 2021, which is way too big. Not useful. Hmm. Let's think differently. Maybe subtract some numbers. For example, 94 minus 47 is 47. Then 47 plus 43 is 90. Then 90 plus 8 is 98. Not 172. Or 94 minus 8 is 86, then 86 plus 47 is 133, plus 43 is 176. Close but not 172.\n\nWait, 176 is 4 more than 172. So maybe that's not the way. Let's think about multiplication. Let's see, 8 times 43 is 344. Then 344 divided by 2 is 172. But how do I get 2 from the remaining numbers 47 and 94. 94 divided by 47 is 2. So maybe (8 * 43) * (94 /47) = 344 *2=688. Not 172. Alternatively, (8 *43) / (94/47). Let's compute that: 344 divided by (94/47). 94/47 is 2, so 344/2=172. Oh! Wait, that works. Let's check:\n\nSo 94 divided by 47 is 2. Then 8 multiplied by 43 is 344. Then 344 divided by 2 equals 172. But we need to use all the numbers: 43, 47, 94, 8. So that uses all of them. Let me write that as an equation: (8 * 43) / (94 /47) = 172. Let me compute step by step. First, 94 /47 =2. Then 8*43=344. Then 344 divided by 2 is indeed 172. And all numbers are used once. So that works. So the equation would be (8 × 43) ÷ (94 ÷ 47) = 172. Let me check if that's correct.\n\nWait, another way to write that without the division symbol: (8 * 43) / (94 /47) = (344) / (2) = 172. Yes. So that uses all four numbers exactly once, each operation is allowed. So that's the answer. Let me just make sure there's no other way, but this seems to fit.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(8 * 43) / (94 / 47) = 172</answer>"}]}

Let's see. 44 - (74 / 3) is messy. Not sure. Maybe 74 - 44 = 30, then 30 / 3 = 10. But 59 * 10 is 590, which is way over. \n\nWait, perhaps using division to get a higher number. For example, 74 divided by something. Let me think. If I do 74 * 5, that's 370. Oh, wait, that's exactly the target. So maybe 74 multiplied by (something) equals 370. Let me check: 370 divided by 74 is 5. So I need to create 5 using 44, 59, and 3. Hmm. Let's see. How can I get 5 from those? 44, 59, 3. Let's see. Maybe 59 - 44 = 15, then 15 /3 =5. That works! So that would be 74 multiplied by ((59 -44)/3). Let's check: 59-44=15, 15/3=5, 74*5=370. Yes! That works. Let me make sure all numbers are used once: 74, 59,44,3. Yep, all four numbers are used once each. So the equation is 74 * ((59 -44)/3) = 370. Let me write that in the required format.\n</think>\n\n<answer>74 * ((59 - 44) / 3) = 370</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using the numbers 39, 66, 21, and 64 exactly once each, with basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) any number of times, and the result should be 949. Hmm. Alright, let's start by thinking about how to get close to 949.\n\nFirst, I should check what the numbers add up to. Let's see: 39 + 66 + 21 + 64. That's 39 + 66 = 105, plus 21 is 126, plus 64 is 190. Way too low. So addition alone isn't going to work. Maybe multiplication?\n\nLooking at the numbers, the largest numbers here are 66 and 64. If I multiply those two, 66 * 64, that would be 4224. Hmm, but 4224 is way higher than 949. Maybe subtract something from that? Let's see. 4224 minus the remaining numbers, which are 39 and 21. But 4224 - (39 +21) = 4224 -60=4164. Still way too high. That's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe divide some numbers. Let's see. If I take 66 divided by something. But 66 divided by 21 is about 3.14, which might not help. Hmm. Maybe 64 divided by something. 64 /21 is around 3.05. Not sure.\n\nWhat if I try combining multiplication and addition? Let's think. Let's see, 66 * 21 is 1386. Then subtract something. 1386 - 64 = 1322. Then subtract 39? 1322 -39=1283. Still too high. Alternatively, 66*21=1386, then maybe 1386 - (64* something). Wait, 64*6 is 384. 1386 -384=1002. Close to 949. But how do I get 384 from the remaining numbers. Wait, 64*6 would need 6, but we don't have a 6. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps using 39 and 21 together. 39+21=60. Then 60 multiplied by something. 60*16=960, which is close to 949. But how to get 16 from 66 and 64. 66-64=2, which isn't helpful. 64 divided by something? 64/ (66- something). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 64 * (66 - (39/21)). Let's compute that. 39 divided by 21 is approximately 1.857. 66 minus that is about 64.143. Multiply by 64: 64 *64.143≈4105. That's way over. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe 66 * (64 - (39 -21)). Let's compute inside the parentheses: 39-21=18. 64-18=46. Then 66*46=3036. Still way too high.\n\nWhat if I try to make 949 using 64 and 66 with subtraction. 66*14=924. Then adding 25 gets to 949. But where would 14 and 25 come from? The other numbers are 39 and 21. Maybe 39 -21=18, which isn't 25. Hmm.\n\nWait, 39*21=819. 819 + something =949. 949-819=130. So maybe 130 from 66 and 64. 66+64=130. Oh! Wait, that works. So 39*21 +66 +64. Let's check that. 39*21 is 819, plus 66 is 885, plus 64 is 949. But wait, that uses all four numbers: 39,21,66,64. So the equation would be 39*21 +66 +64 =949. Let me verify:\n\n39 multiplied by 21 is 819. Then 819 +66 is 885, then 885 +64 is indeed 949. Perfect! So that's the equation. All numbers used once, and the operations are multiplication and addition. So the equation is (39 * 21) + 66 + 64 = 949. Let me check again:\n\n39 *21: 39*20=780, 39*1=39, total 819. Then 819 +66=885. 885 +64=949. Yes! That's correct. So that's the solution.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(39 * 21) + 66 + 64 = 949</answer>"}]}

I need to use all the numbers 4, 42, 1, and 85 exactly once each, with basic operations to make 131. Hmm. Let me start by looking at the target number and the numbers given. 131 is a bit over 85, so maybe I can use 85 as a base and add or subtract something. Let's try that.\n\nIf I take 85 and add something. What's left? The other numbers are 4, 42, and 1. Let's see, 85 + 42 is 127, which is close to 131. Then I have 4 and 1 left. How can I combine 4 and 1 to get 4 more? Well, 4 + 1 is 5, but that's too much. Wait, 127 + 4 would be 131, but then I still have to use 1. Oh right, all numbers must be used. So that approach might not work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 85 plus 42 is 127, and then subtract (4 -1) which is 3. So 127 -3 is 124. Not enough. Hmm. What if I do 85 + (42 -4) ? That's 85 +38=123. Then add 1? 124. Still not.\n\nWait, maybe multiply somewhere. Let's see. If I can get a larger number by multiplying. For example, 42 * 4 is 168. Then subtract 85 and add 1? Let's calculate: 168 -85 =83, 83 +1=84. No, that's not enough.\n\nWhat if I do 85 * (4 -1) ? That's 85*3=255. Then subtract 42? 255-42=213. Way over.\n\nAlternatively, 42 * (4 +1) =42*5=210. Then 210 -85=125. Still 6 short.\n\nWait another approach: Maybe 85 + (4 * something). Let's see. If I use 4, 42, 1. Let's see 42 -1 is 41. 4*41=164. 85 +164=249. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 85 +4=89. Then 89 +42=131. But then I have 1 left. Oh, but I have to use all numbers. So 85 +4 +42 =131, but that leaves out the 1. So that's not allowed. So maybe need to incorporate the 1 somehow. Maybe 85 + (42 +4) -1. Let's calculate: 42 +4=46, 85+46=131. Then subtract 1 would be 130. Hmm. Close but not quite.\n\nWait, maybe 85 + (42 - (4 -1)). Let's see: 4-1=3. 42-3=39. 85+39=124. No. Not enough.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 42 * 4 =168. Then 168 -85=83. Then 83 +1=84. Still not.\n\nWhat if I do (85 -42) *4 +1. 85-42=43. 43*4=172. 172 +1=173. Nope.\n\nWait, let's think differently. Maybe divide somewhere. For example, 85 + 42 =127. Then maybe 4 divided by 1 is 4, so 127 +4=131. Wait, that uses all numbers: 85 +42 + (4/1) =85+42+4=131. But wait, 4 divided by 1 is 4, so yes. Let's check: 85 +42=127, 4/1=4, so 127+4=131. That works! But did I use all numbers? 85,42,4,1. Yes. Each once. And operations are + and /.\n\nWait, but is that allowed? The problem says to use each number once and all of them. So 85 +42 +4/1. Since division is allowed. So that equation would be (85 +42) + (4/1) =131. So the equation would be 85 +42 +4/1 =131. Let me check that: 4 divided by 1 is 4. 85+42 is 127. 127+4=131. Yes! So that works. But the question is, can I write it like that? Because the numbers are used once each, and the operations are +, +, /. But maybe I need to structure the equation correctly. Alternatively, maybe parentheses are needed. But in this case, order of operations would handle division first. So 4/1 is 4. Then add 85 and 42. So yes, 85+42+4/1=131.\n\nSo that's a possible answer. Let me double-check. Did I use all numbers? 85,42,4,1. Yes. Each once. All operations are allowed. So the equation would be 85 + 42 + 4 / 1 =131. Alternatively, written with parentheses as (4 /1) +85 +42. Either way. So maybe the answer is (85 + 42) + (4 / 1) =131. But perhaps the equation can be written without parentheses because division has higher precedence. So 85 +42 +4/1. That works.\n</think>\n\n<answer>85 + 42 + 4 / 1 = 131</answer>"}]}

Hmm. Let's start by thinking about the operations and how these numbers can combine.\n\nFirst, 282 is a bit over 200, so maybe one of the larger numbers can be divided or multiplied to get close. 956 is the biggest number here. If I divide 956 by something, maybe that could give me a manageable number. Let's try 956 divided by... let's see, 956 divided by 20 is 47.8. Hmm, not sure if that helps. What if I subtract something from 956? 956 minus 74 is 882. Still too big. Maybe 956 minus 17 is 939. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use multiplication. 74 times 20 is 1480. That's way too big. 17 times 20 is 340. Still too high. What if I subtract 17 from 956? 956 - 17 = 939. Then maybe divide by something. 939 divided by 3.3 is about 282, but I don't have a 3.3. Wait, but maybe 939 divided by (20 - 74/17). Wait, that's getting complicated. Let me check 74 divided by 17. That's approximately 4.3529. Then 20 minus that is around 15.647. 939 divided by 15.647 is roughly 60. That's not 282. Hmm.\n\nLet me try a different approach. 282 is 3 times 94, or 6 times 47. Maybe 20 times 14.1, but again, not sure. Let's look for combinations where numbers can be subtracted or added to reach somewhere close. Maybe 956 divided by something. Let's see, 956 divided by 3.4 is about 281.18, which is close to 282. How could I get 3.4? Maybe 20 minus 17 is 3, then plus 0.4 from 74? Wait, not sure. Alternatively, 17 plus 20 is 37. 956 divided by 37 is approximately 25.83, which isn't helpful.\n\nWait, maybe combining 74 and 17 first. 74 minus 17 is 57. Then 57 times 5 is 285, which is close. But how to get 5 from 20 and 956? 956 divided by 20 is 47.8. That's not 5. Alternatively, 20 divided by something. 20 divided by 4 is 5. How to get 4? Maybe 74 minus 70, but 70 isn't here. Alternatively, 17 minus 13, but again, not helpful.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe 956 minus some value. Let's see, 956 - (something) = 282. So 956 - 282 = 674. So I need to make 674 using 74, 17, 20. That seems tricky. 74 times 9 is 666, plus 8 is 674. But how to get 9 and 8 from 17 and 20? 20 minus 11, but 11 isn't here. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 956 divided by something equals 282. Let's see: 956 divided by x = 282. Then x ≈ 3.39. So can I make 3.39 with the remaining numbers 74, 17, 20? Let's see. Maybe 20 divided by (17 - (74/ something)). Not sure. 74 divided by 17 is about 4.352. Then 20 - 4.352 is around 15.648. 20 divided by 15.648 is about 1.28. Not 3.39. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps using multiplication and subtraction. Let's think about 74 * 17. That's 1258. Then subtract something. 1258 - 956 = 302. Close to 282. Difference is 20. Oh, wait, but 302 - 20 = 282. But then I have used 74,17,956,20. Wait, let's check that: 74*17 = 1258. 1258 - 956 = 302. Then 302 - 20 = 282. But that uses all four numbers: 74*17 - 956 -20. Wait, but that's 74*17 = 1258, 1258 -956 = 302, 302 -20=282. So equation would be (74 * 17) - 956 - 20 = 282. Let me check the math: 74*17 is 1258. 1258 -956 is 302. 302 -20 is 282. Yes! That works. But wait, does that use all numbers once? 74,17,956,20. Yes. Each number is used once, and all are used. And operations are multiplication, subtraction, subtraction. So the equation is (74 * 17) - 956 - 20 = 282. Let me write that as (74 * 17) - 956 - 20. Alternatively, maybe parentheses can be adjusted, but according to order of operations, multiplication comes first, so 74*17 is 1258, then subtract 956 and 20. So yes, that gives 282. So that's the equation.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(74 * 17) - 956 - 20 = 282</answer>"}]}

If I multiply 56 by 7, that's 392. Then add 52? 392 +52=444. Then 385 is left. But 444 +385 would be way over. That's 829. Not helpful. Maybe subtract 385? 444-385=59.

Let me start by thinking about the target number. 143 is between 140 and 145, so maybe I can get close by combining some of the larger numbers first.\n\nLooking at the numbers, 80 and 30 are the bigger ones. If I subtract them, 80 - 30 is 50. Not close. If I add them, 80 + 30 is 110. Still need 33 more. Hmm, but I have 27 and 6 left. 27 + 6 is 33. So 110 + 33 = 143. Wait, that would be 80 + 30 + 27 + 6, but that uses all numbers with addition, but the total would be 80+30=110, 110+27=137, 137+6=143. Oh wait, that actually works. But wait, does that use each number once and all of them? Let's check: 80 + 27 + 30 + 6 = 143. Yes, adding all four. But is that allowed? The problem says you can use the operations one or multiple times but each number once. So addition is allowed multiple times. So that equation would be 80 + 27 + 30 + 6 = 143. But let me check: 80+27 is 107, plus 30 is 137, plus 6 is 143. Yes. But wait, the problem says \"create an equation that equals 143\" using all numbers with each used once. So that seems possible. But maybe the user expects using operations more creatively because that's straightforward. But maybe that's the answer. Wait, but let me confirm if that's acceptable. The problem says \"you can use basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) one or multiple times but each number can only be used once, and you must use all the numbers.\" So adding them all together is allowed. So 80 + 27 + 30 + 6 = 143. That seems correct. Let me verify the sum again: 80 + 27 is 107, 107 +30 is 137, 137 +6 is 143. Yes. That works. So maybe the answer is simply adding all the numbers together. But wait, maybe there's a trick here. Let me check if I made a mistake. Wait, 80 +27 is 107? No, 80 + 20 is 100, plus 7 is 107. Yes. Then 107 +30 is 137, plus 6 is 143. Correct. Hmm. So that's a valid equation. So maybe the answer is (80 + 27) + (30 +6) = 143, but the parentheses aren't necessary. Alternatively, just 80 + 27 + 30 + 6 = 143. But the example given in the problem uses parentheses, like (1+2)/3. So perhaps the answer should have some operations grouped with parentheses even if not necessary, but maybe not. Wait, the problem says to return the equation, so as long as it's correct. So perhaps the simplest answer is 80 + 27 + 30 + 6 = 143. But maybe the problem expects using multiplication or division. Let me check again. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the addition. Let me add again: 80 +27: 80+20=100, +7=107. 107 +30: 100+30=130, +7=137. 137 +6=143. Correct. So that's valid. So why would the problem be considered challenging then? Because maybe it's intended to require some operations other than just addition. Let me see if there's another way. Let's think differently. For example, 143 is 11 × 13. But how to get 11 and 13 from the numbers. Alternatively, 143 is 140 +3, or 150 -7, etc. Let's see. Let's try with multiplication. Let's see: 80 × something. If I do 80 × 1.7875 would give 143, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe 27 × 5. That's 135, then add 8 (from 80-72). Not sure. Let's see. Alternatively, 30 × 4 is 120, plus 23 (from 27 -4). But how to get 4. Maybe 80 divided by something. 80 divided by 6 is about 13.3, but not helpful. Alternatively, 27 - 6 =21. Then 21 + 80=101. 101 +30=131. Not enough. Hmm. Another approach: 80 - something. Let's see 80 - (something) = part of the equation. Then the remaining numbers must add up to 80 -143 = negative, which is not possible. Alternatively, maybe multiply two numbers. For example, 30 × 6 = 180. Then 180 -27=153. 153 -80=73. Not helpful. How about 80 + (27 × something). 27 × 5=135. 135 +8=143. But where to get 5 and 8. Let me see. The remaining numbers are 30 and 6. 30/6=5. So 27 × (30/6) = 27×5=135. Then 135 +80=215. That's too much. Not helpful. Alternatively, 80 + (27 - (30/6)). Let's see: 30/6=5. 27-5=22. 80+22=102. Still not 143. Hmm. What if I do 80 × (something). Let's see, 80 × 1.7875 =143, but how to get 1.7875 from 27,30,6. Maybe 27 +30=57, 57 /6=9.5. 9.5 +1=10.5. Not helpful. Alternatively, 30 /6=5. 27 -5=22. 80 +22=102. Still not. How about 27 ×6=162. Then 162 - (80 -30)=162 -50=112. No. Alternatively, 27 ×5=135. 135 + (80 - (30+6))=135+44=179. No. Wait, perhaps (80 + 27) =107, then 30 ×6=180. 180 -107=73. Not helpful. Alternatively, 80 × (30 /6) =80×5=400. Then 400 -27=373. Nope. Hmm. Let's try division. Maybe 80 / something. 80 / (6/30) which is 80 × (30/6) =80×5=400. Not helpful. Alternatively, (27 ×6) +80 +30. 27×6=162. 162+80=242, +30=272. No. What if I do 80 +30=110. Then 27 ×6=162. 162 -110=52. Not close. Hmm. Another angle: 143 is 140 +3. Let's see if I can get 140 and 3. 80 + 30=110. 27 -6=21. 110 +21=131. Not. Alternatively, 80 + (30 × something) - 27. Let's see, 30 ×6=180. 180 +80=260. 260 -27=233. No. Alternatively, 30 × (6 + something). Not sure. Maybe (80 - (30/6)) × something. 30/6=5. 80-5=75. 75 ×27=2025. Way too big. Hmm. Wait, maybe combining subtraction and addition. Let's think: 143 = 80 + 27 + 30 +6. As before. That's straightforward. Maybe that's the answer. Let me check again. 80+27=107, 107+30=137, 137+6=143. Yes, that's correct. So maybe the answer is just adding all four numbers together. The problem didn't state that we need to use operations other than addition, just that we can use any of them. So that's allowed. Therefore, the equation is 80 + 27 + 30 + 6 = 143. Let me confirm once more: 80+27 is 107, plus 30 is 137, plus 6 is indeed 143. Yep. So maybe that's the solution. But I'm a bit surprised because it's straightforward addition. Maybe the problem expects a more complex equation. Let me check if there's another way. Suppose we need to use multiplication or division. Let's try again. Let's see, 27 ×5=135. Then 135 +8=143. How to get 5 and 8 from 80,30,6. 30/6=5. Then 80 / something=8. 80 /10=8. How to get 10 from remaining numbers. But we have used 30 and 6 already. Wait, if we do 30/6=5, then 27×5=135. Then we need 8 more. The remaining numbers are 80. 80 divided by 10=8. But where to get 10. Wait, we have already used 30 and 6. So that approach uses 30,6,27. Then 80 remains. So 135 +8=143. But 8 is from 80 divided by 10, but 10 isn't available. So this might not work. Alternatively, 80 - (something)=8. But how? 80-72=8. 72 could be 6×12, but where to get 12. Not possible with the remaining numbers. Hmm. Alternatively, 80 divided by (30 - (27 -6))=80/(30-21)=80/9≈8.888, not helpful. Another approach: 80 × (something) plus another number. Let's see. 80×1=80. 80×2=160, which is over. 160-17=143. So 17 from 27,30,6. 27-10=17. How to get 10. 30-20=10. Wait, but 27 and 30 can't be both used. Hmm. Alternatively, 27 - (30/6)=27-5=22. 80 +22=102. Still not. Wait, 80 + (27 × (6 - (30/ something))). Not sure. Let's try 30 divided by 5=6. But 5 is from where. Maybe 80/16=5. But 16 isn't available. This seems getting too convoluted. Let me check again the initial solution. 80+27+30+6=143. Yes, that's correct. So perhaps that's the intended answer. Maybe the problem is designed to test if people overcomplicate it, but the simple addition works. Therefore, the equation is simply adding all four numbers together.\n</think>\n\n<answer>80 + 27 + 30 + 6 = 143</answer>"}]}

The result should be 144. Hmm. First, I'll jot down the numbers again to make sure I have them right: 398, 960, 343, 871. All four must be used once with basic operations. \n\nLet me start by thinking about possible combinations. Since 960 is a large number, maybe subtracting something from it could help. If I subtract 398 from 960, that would give 960 - 398 = 562. That's still way larger than 144. Maybe I can divide that result by something. But then I have 343 and 871 left. If I take 562 and divide by, say, 343, that's about 1.64, not helpful. Alternatively, maybe multiply? 562 * 343 would be way too big. Hmm, perhaps that's not the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use division to reduce the numbers. Let's see 960 divided by something. 960 / 398 is about 2.41. Then maybe subtract or add other numbers. But that seems tricky. What about 871 minus something? 871 - 343 = 528. If I subtract that from 960, 960 - 528 = 432. Still not 144. Maybe divide by 3. But where's the 3? 398 divided by something? Wait, 343 is 7 cubed (7^3 = 343), maybe that can be useful. 7*7*7. Hmm. 871 is close to 870, which is 29*30. Not sure. \n\nLet me try a different approach. Since 144 is 12 squared, maybe I can find a way to get 12^2. Alternatively, 144 is 16*9, or 24*6, etc. Let's see. If I can combine two numbers to get 12 and then square it, but how? Alternatively, maybe multiply some numbers and divide by others. Let's try combining 343 and 960. 343 is 7^3, so maybe that's useful. 960 divided by 343 is approximately 2.8. Not helpful. \n\nWait, 960 divided by something else. Let's see, 960 divided by 398 is roughly 2.41. Not helpful. Maybe 871 divided by 343? 871/343 is approximately 2.54. If I subtract that from, say, 960, it's 957.46. Not helpful. \n\nWait, maybe combining subtraction and division. Let's think: (960 - 871) = 89. Then, 89 divided by something. But 89 divided by 343 is about 0.26. Then 398 * 0.26 is about 103.48, not 144. Hmm. \n\nWhat if I take 398 and 343. 398 - 343 = 55. Then 55 * something. But 960 and 871. 960 - 871 = 89. 55 + 89 = 144. Wait, that's interesting! Let me check that again. 398 - 343 = 55. Then 960 - 871 = 89. Then 55 + 89 = 144. Oh! So if I can combine those two differences. But how do I use all four numbers in a single equation? Because right now, it's (398 - 343) + (960 - 871) = 55 +89=144. But each number is used once, and all four are used. So the equation would be (398 - 343) + (960 - 871) = 144. But does that fit the requirements? Let me check: each number is used once, all are used, and only basic operations. Yes. But I need to make sure that the parentheses are correct and the operations are applied correctly. So the equation is (398 - 343) + (960 - 871) = 144. Let me compute each part again. 398 -343=55, 960-871=89. 55+89=144. Exactly. So that works! But I need to present it as an equation using all numbers once with operations. So that's perfect. The equation is (398 - 343) + (960 - 871) = 144. All numbers used once, operations are subtraction and addition. That should be the answer.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(398 - 343) + (960 - 871) = 144</answer>"}]}

Each number must be used exactly once, and the result should be 450. The operations allowed are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Hmm, how do I approach this?\n\nFirst, maybe I should think about the target number, 450, and see how I can break it down using the given numbers. 450 is a fairly large number, so maybe multiplication will be involved. Let's check the numbers we have. The largest number here is 342. If I can somehow subtract or add another number to 342 to get closer to 450, that might work. Let's try adding. 342 + 48 = 390. Still way short. 342 + 68 = 410. Closer, but still not 450. 342 + 8 = 350. No, that's even less. So maybe multiplication?\n\nWait, 342 is already a big number. If I multiply it by something. But the other numbers are 48, 68, and 8. If I could do 342 plus (something multiplied by something else). Let's see. Let's check if 342 + (48 * 8) would work. 48*8 is 384. 342 + 384 is 726, which is way over. That's too much.\n\nAlternatively, maybe subtract something from 342 and then multiply. Like (342 - 48) * something. 342 -48 is 294. 294 * 1.5 is 441, but 1.5 isn't an integer. Hmm. Not sure. Alternatively, if I use 68 and 8. 68 * 8 is 544. Then 544 - 342 is 202. That's not helpful. Maybe 342 multiplied by something else. Let's see, 342 * (68 / 48) ? Let's calculate 68/48 is approximately 1.4167. 342 * 1.4167 is roughly 342 * 1.4 = 478.8 plus a bit more, so maybe around 485. Close to 450, but not exactly. But we need exact numbers here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 48 multiplied by something. 48 * 9.375 is 450. But where would 9.375 come from? Let's see, 342 divided by 68 is approximately 5.029. 342/68 is 5.029. If I add 8, 5.029 +8=13.029. Not helpful. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe combine 68 and 8 first. 68 - 8 = 60. Then 48 * 60 = 2880. 342 + 2880 is way over. No. Alternatively, 68/8 = 8.5. Then 48 * 8.5 = 408. 342 + 408 = 750. Still too big. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe subtract 342 from something else. But 48, 68, 8 are all smaller. Wait, 68 * 8 is 544. Then 544 - 48 = 496. 496 - 342 = 154. Not helpful. Maybe 544 + 48 = 592. 592 - 342 = 250. Nope.\n\nWait, maybe use division in a smart way. For example, 342 divided by something. 342 / (something) = 450. But that would require the denominator to be 342/450 = 0.76. But how to get 0.76 from 48, 68, 8. Not sure. Alternatively, 342 plus something equals 450. Then the something needs to be 108. Can I make 108 from 48, 68, 8? Let's see. 68 + 48 = 116, subtract 8 gives 108. Oh! So 342 + (68 +48 -8) = 342 + 108 = 450. Wait, but the problem requires that each number is used exactly once, and all operations are allowed but each number can only be used once. But in this case, I used 342, 68, 48, and 8, each once. But the equation would be 342 + 68 + 48 - 8 = 450. Let's check: 342 +68 is 410, 410 +48 is 458, 458 -8 is 450. Yes! That works. Wait, but does that use all four numbers once each? Yes: 342, 68, 48, and 8. Each used once. The operations are addition and subtraction. So the equation would be 342 + 68 + 48 - 8 = 450. Is that correct? Let me calculate again step by step. 342 +68 = 410. 410 +48 = 458. 458 -8 = 450. Exactly. So that's the equation. But let me see if there's another way, but this seems straightforward. But wait, the question says to return the equation in <answer> tags. So maybe write it as (342 + 68) + (48 - 8) or just 342 + 68 + 48 -8. Either way, but perhaps the simplest form. Alternatively, maybe grouping is needed for clarity. Let me check the arithmetic again. 342 +68 is 410, 48-8 is 40, then 410+40 is 450. So perhaps (342 +68) + (48 -8) = 450. That's another way to write it. But either way, all numbers are used once. So this seems to satisfy the conditions. Let me double-check if that's allowed. The operations used are + and -, which are allowed, and all numbers used once. Yes. So the answer should be (342 + 68) + (48 - 8) = 450. Alternatively, written without parentheses as 342 + 68 + 48 -8. But the problem says to return the equation. Since parentheses can be added for clarity but aren't necessary here, but maybe the system expects a particular format. Let me see if there are other possible equations. For example, maybe using multiplication or division. Let's explore that.\n\nSuppose I do 342 + (68 -8) * (48 / something). Wait, but I have to use all numbers once. For example, perhaps 342 + (68 - 8) * (48 / something). Wait, 48 would have to be divided by another number, but the remaining numbers are 342,68,8. But 342 is already used. Wait, maybe (48 * (68 - 8)) + 342. Wait, 68-8 is 60. 48*60 is 2880. 2880 +342 is 3222. Way too big. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 342 * (something). Suppose I do 342 * (48 / (68 -8)). Let's see: 68 -8 is 60. 48/60 is 0.8. 342 *0.8 is 273.6. Not 450.\n\nAlternatively, 342 + (48 * (68 /8)). Let's compute 68 /8 is 8.5. 48 *8.5 is 408. 342 +408 = 750. No.\n\nWhat if I do 342 + (68 * (48 /8)). 48/8 is 6. 68*6 is 408. 342 +408 = 750 again. Same result.\n\nAlternatively, 48 * 8 + (342 -68). 48*8=384. 342-68=274. 384+274=658. No.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, 68 * 8 - (342 -48). 68*8=544. 342-48=294. 544-294=250. No.\n\nWhat if I do (342 - 48) * (68 /8). 342-48=294. 68/8=8.5. 294*8.5=2499. Way too big.\n\nAlternatively, 342 - 68 + 48*8. 342-68=274. 48*8=384. 274+384=658. No.\n\nAlternatively, 342 / (68/48) +8. Let's see, 68/48=1.416..., 342/1.416≈241.5. 241.5+8≈249.5. Not 450.\n\nHmm. Not working. Let's check if the earlier solution is the only possible. The equation 342 +68 +48 -8 =450 seems correct. So that uses all numbers once with addition and subtraction. So maybe that's the answer. Let me check again. 342 +68 is 410, 410 +48 is 458, 458 -8 is 450. Yes. So the equation is 342 + 68 + 48 - 8 =450. Since each number is used exactly once, and all four numbers are used, and allowed operations are applied. So that should be the correct answer.\n</think>\n\n<answer>342 + 68 + 48 - 8 = 450</answer>"}]}

For example, 90 divided by something. If I take 90 divided by 18, that's 5. But how can I get 18 from the remaining numbers 20, 60, and 6? Let me check. 20 minus 6 is 14, 60 divided by 20 is 3. Hmm, not helpful. Alternatively, maybe 20 minus (60 divided by 6). Let's calculate that: 60 divided by 6 is 10, so 20 -10 =10. Then 90 divided by 10 is 9. Not 5. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe if I subtract numbers first. Let's see: 60 - 20 =40. Then 90 divided by (40 something with 6). If I do 40 divided by 6, that's around 6.666. Then 90 divided by that would be 13.5. Not helpful. Maybe multiply 40 by 6? 40*6=240. 90/240=0.375. Not 5.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use 90 and 60 together. 90 -60=30. Then how to use 20 and 6 to get from 30 to 5. Let's see, 30 divided by 6 is 5. Oh! Wait, if I have 90 -60 =30, then 30 divided by 6 is 5. But then I still have 20 left to use. Oh, right, I have to use all numbers. So that approach only uses 90,60,6. Leaves out 20. So that's not allowed.\n\nHmm, so maybe rearrange. What if I do (90 - (60 / 6)) /20. Let's calculate that. 60 divided by 6 is 10. Then 90-10=80. 80 divided by 20 is 4. Close to 5, but not quite. Alternatively, maybe (90 - (20 * something)) divided by something. Let's try using 20 multiplied by 6: 20*6=120. Then 90 -120= -30. Then -30 divided by 60 is -0.5. Not helpful.\n\nWait another angle: Maybe combine 20 and 6 first. 20 divided by 6 is approximately 3.333. Then 90 minus that would be 86.666, then divided by 60 gives about 1.444. Not helpful. Alternatively, 20 +6=26. 90-26=64. 64 divided by 60 is about 1.066. Still not 5.\n\nWait, perhaps using multiplication and division. Let's think: 6 multiplied by something equals a number that can be used with others. Let's see. If I do 90 divided by 6, that's 15. Then maybe 15 minus (60 divided by 20). Let's calculate 60 divided by 20 is 3. So 15-3=12. Still not 5.\n\nAlternatively, 60 divided by (20 - (90 /6)). Let's compute 90/6=15. 20-15=5. Then 60 divided by 5=12. No, but that gives 12. Wait, but that uses 90,6,20,60. Wait, let's check: 90/6=15, 20-15=5, then 60 divided by that 5 is 12. So that uses all numbers, but the result is 12. Not 5. Close idea though.\n\nWait, maybe rearrange: 60 divided by ( (90 divided by something) -20). Let me try. Suppose I have 90 divided by something. Let's say 90 divided by 6 is 15. Then 15 -20= -5. Then 60 divided by -5 is -12. Not helpful. How about 90 divided by (20 + something). If I do 20 +6=26, then 90/26≈3.46. Then 60 -3.46≈56.54. Not 5.\n\nHmm. Let's try a different approach. Maybe grouping numbers. For example, (90 -60) / (20 -6). Let's see: 30 divided by 14≈2.14. Not 5. How about (90 +60) divided by (20 +6)=150/26≈5.769. Closer. But not exactly 5. But the problem doesn't specify if decimal points or fractions are allowed. Wait, the problem says to create an equation that equals 5. So maybe using exact values. Let me check: 150 divided by 30 is 5. But that's not using 20 and 6. Wait, 90 +60=150. 20 -6=14. 150/14 is not 5.\n\nAlternatively, 90 - (60 +20) =10. Then 10 divided by 6≈1.666. Not 5. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe use multiplication and division. Like (90 * 6) divided by (60 * something). Let's compute 90*6=540. Then 60*20=1200. 540/1200=0.45. Not 5. Not helpful. Alternatively, (90 *20)/(60 *6). Let's compute 1800/360=5. Oh! Wait, that works! Because 90 multiplied by 20 is 1800, and 60 multiplied by 6 is 360. 1800 divided by 360 equals 5.

Let's start by thinking about possible combinations.\n\nFirst, maybe look for numbers that are close to 35. 30 is 5 less than 35. 42 is 7 more. 53 is way bigger, 16 is smaller. So perhaps using 30 as a base and adding or subtracting something. But how to get the rest to adjust to 5 or 7?\n\nAlternatively, maybe combine two numbers to get a value and then subtract or add another pair. Let's see. Let me list out possible pairs and their results.\n\n42 and 53: Adding them gives 95, which is too big. Subtracting: 53-42=11. 42-53 is negative. Maybe that's useful? 53-42=11, then 30 and 16. How can 11, 30, 16 combine? 30-16=14. 11+14=25. Not 35. 30+16=46. 46-11=35. Oh, wait! Wait, that's 53-42=11. Then 30+16=46. Then 46-11=35. But we need to use all four numbers. So that would be (30 + 16) - (53 - 42) = 46 - 11 = 35. Let me check if that uses all numbers: 30, 16, 53, 42. Yes! So that works. Let me write that out:\n\n(30 + 16) - (53 - 42) = 35. Let's compute:\n\n30+16=46\n\n53-42=11\n\n46-11=35. Yes, that's correct. So the equation would be (30 + 16) - (53 - 42) = 35. Let me just make sure all numbers are used once. 30,16,53,42. Yes, all four. So that's the answer. Alternatively, maybe another combination exists, but this seems to work. Let me check if there's another way, just in case.\n\nAnother approach: Let's say using division or multiplication. For example, 42 divided by something. 42/ (something) plus or minus others. For example, 42 - (53-30)/16. Let's see: 53-30=23. 23/16 is about 1.4375. 42 - 1.4375=40.5625. Not 35. Hmm. Or 53 - (42 + 30)/16. 42+30=72. 72/16=4.5. 53 -4.5=48.5. Not helpful.\n\nWhat if we use multiplication? 16 * something. 16*2=32. 32+3=35. But how to get 2 and 3 from 42,53,30. Maybe 30- (53-42) =30-11=19. Not helpful. Alternatively, 53 - 42=11, then 30 - 16=14. 11+14=25. Not 35.\n\nWait, but the first solution I had works. So maybe that's the correct one. Let me check again. 30 +16 is 46. 53-42 is 11. 46-11 is 35. Yep. So the equation is (30 + 16) - (53 - 42) =35. All numbers used once. So that's the answer.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(30 + 16) - (53 - 42) = 35</answer>"}]}

Let's see how I can approach this.\n\nFirst, I should note the target is 320. Let me think about the numbers I have. 80 is a big number, maybe that can be multiplied by something. 49 is close to 50, which is half of 100, but not sure. 37 is a prime number, and 3 is small.\n\nLet me try to break down 320. 320 divided by 80 is 4.

Then 12 divided by 3 is 4. Oh! That could work. So (49 - 37)/3 = 4. Then multiply that by 80. So the equation would be ((49 - 37)/3) * 80. Let's calculate that: 49-37=12, 12/3=4, 4*80=320. Perfect! That uses all the numbers once each. Let me double-check: 49 is used, 37 is used, 3 is used, 80 is used. All operations are basic. That should be the answer.\n</think>\n\n<answer>((49 - 37) / 3) * 80</answer>"}]}

Let's start by thinking about how these numbers can combine.\n\nFirst, 809 is the target. Let's look at the numbers given. The largest number here is 982. Maybe I can subtract something from 982 to get close to 809. Let's calculate 982 minus 809. That gives 173. So if I can somehow make 173 using the remaining numbers (63, 310, 74), then 982 - 173 = 809. Let's check if that's possible.\n\nThe remaining numbers are 63, 310, 74. Need to combine them to make 173. Let's see. 310 is a big number. Maybe subtract something from it. 310 - 63 = 247. That's too big. 310 - 74 = 236, still too big. Maybe 310 - (63 + 74) = 310 - 137 = 173. Oh! That works. So 63 + 74 = 137, then 310 - 137 = 173. Then 982 - 173 = 809. Putting it all together, using each number once. Let me check if all numbers are used: 982, 310, 63, 74. Yes, all four. So the equation would be 982 - (310 - (63 + 74)) = 809. Let me compute that step by step. 63 +74 is 137. Then 310 - 137 is 173. 982 - 173 equals 809. Perfect! So the equation is 982 - (310 - (63 + 74)) = 809. Let me just make sure I didn't use any numbers more than once. 63, 74, 310, 982. All used once.

Let's start by thinking about the target number, 474. It's a bit large, so probably multiplication will be involved. Let me try to see how these numbers can combine.\n\nFirst, 79 is the largest number here. If I can multiply 79 by something close to 6, since 79*6 is 474. Wait, 79*6 is exactly 474! Oh, that's interesting. So maybe if I can get 6 from the other numbers (4, 24, 36), then 79*6 would work. But how to get 6 from 4, 24, and 36? Let me check.\n\nLet's see the remaining numbers: 4, 24, 36. I need to use all three. Maybe subtract or divide. For example, 24 divided by 4 is 6. Then, 36 is left. But wait, I need to use all numbers. So if I use 24/4 to get 6, but then I still have 36 left. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe combine 36 and 24 first. 36 - 24 is 12. Then 12 divided by 4 is 3. But that's 3, not 6. Not helpful. Or 36 divided by (24/4). Let's calculate: 24/4 is 6, then 36 divided by 6 is 6. Wait, that's 6. So 36/(24/4) = 36/6 = 6. So that gives me 6. But then that uses all three numbers: 24, 4, and 36. So the expression would be 79 multiplied by (36 divided by (24 divided by 4)). Let's check that.\n\nBreaking it down: 24 divided by 4 is 6. Then 36 divided by 6 is 6. Then 79 multiplied by 6 is 474. Yes! That works. Let me write that equation: 79 * (36 / (24 / 4)) = 474.

I need to create an equation using all the numbers 96, 69, 82, 83 exactly once, with basic operations, to equal 1. Hmm. Let's start by thinking about possible combinations.\n\nFirst, maybe I can pair some numbers to get closer to 1. Let's see. 96 and 69 are both divisible by 3. 96 divided by 3 is 32, 69 divided by 3 is 23. Not sure if that helps yet. The other numbers are 82 and 83. Those are consecutive numbers, so their difference is 1. Wait, 83 minus 82 is 1. That's useful. So maybe if I can use 83 - 82 to get 1, then somehow combine the other two numbers to get 1 as well, and maybe multiply or add them? But I need to use all four numbers.\n\nAlternatively, use the 83 -82 as part of a larger equation. Let's see. Let's take 83 -82 =1. Then we have 96 and 69 left. How can I combine 96 and 69 with operations to get 1? Maybe 96 divided by 69? 96/69 is approximately 1.391. Not 1. Hmm. What if we subtract them? 96-69=27. Not helpful. Multiply? 96*69 is 6624, way too big. Maybe subtract first and then divide? Like (96 -69) =27, then 27 divided by something. But I already used 96 and 69. Wait, the other numbers are 82 and 83. Wait, maybe 27 divided by (83-82) is 27/1=27. Still not 1. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe arrange it so that (something) divided by (something else) equals 1. So numerator and denominator must be equal. Let's see. Let's try to make two expressions that are equal. For example, using 96 and 69 in one part, 82 and 83 in another. Like 96 - 69 = 27, and 83 -82=1. Then maybe 27 / (something) =1. But how to get 27? Wait, but 27 is already 96-69. So if I can have (96-69)/(something) =1, then that something must be 27. But the remaining numbers are 82 and 83. 83-82=1, so 27/(1)=27. Not helpful. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe use division with the larger numbers. Let's see. 96 divided by something. If I do 96/(83 - something). Let's see. If I use 83 -82 =1, then 96/1=96. Then subtract 69? 96 -69=27. Not helpful. Alternatively, 96/(69) = 1.391... Hmm. Maybe combine 82 and 83 in a way that gives a certain value. Like 82 +83=165. Then maybe 165 -96=69. So that's 82+83 -96=69. Then 69 divided by 69=1. But we already used 69 once. Wait, but each number can only be used once. So that's not allowed. Because 69 is used in both the subtraction and the division. So that approach won't work.\n\nAlternatively, think of combining 83 and 82 as 83 -82 =1. Then use 96 and 69 to make 1. Let's see. 96 - 69 =27. 27 divided by 27 is 1. But we don't have an extra 27. Wait, but if we use 83-82=1, and then 96/(something) -69=1. Let's try that. 96/x -69=1 → 96/x=70 → x=96/70≈1.371. Not helpful. Hmm.\n\nMaybe use multiplication and division. For example, (96 - 69) / (83 -82) = 27 /1=27. Then maybe subtract 26 to get 1? But we don't have 26. Alternatively, combine operations. Maybe (96 / (83 -82)) -69 = 96/1 -69=27. Still 27. Not helpful.\n\nWait, another approach: maybe use fractions. Like (something)/(something else) =1. So if I can make two expressions equal. For example, 96 -69 =27 and 83 -82=1. Then 27/1=27. Not 1. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe use division in a clever way. Let's see. Let's take 96 divided by (something) equals 1. That would require the denominator to be 96. But how to make 96 from the other numbers: 69,82,83. Let's see. 83 -82=1, then 69 +1=70. Not 96. Alternatively, 69 + (83-82)=69+1=70. Not 96. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, multiply two numbers and divide by the product of the other two. For example, (96 *69) / (82*83). Let's compute that. 96*69=6624. 82*83=6806. Then 6624/6806≈0.973. Close to 1 but not exactly. Maybe not. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, try to use subtraction and division. For example, (96 - (83 -82)) /69. Let's compute that: 83-82=1, so 96-1=95. 95/69≈1.376. Not 1.\n\nWhat if we do (83 -82) * (96 -69) =1*27=27. Then maybe subtract 26. But again, no 26.\n\nWait, maybe combine all operations. Let's think: (96 -69) / (83 -82) - (82 - something). Wait, but we already used 82. Wait, each number can only be used once.\n\nWait, maybe use a combination like 96 / (69 + 82 -83). Let's compute denominator: 69 +82=151, 151-83=68. So 96/68=1.411... Not 1.\n\nAlternatively, (83 -82) + (69 -96). That's 1 + (-27)= -26. Not helpful.\n\nHmm. Let's try a different approach. Let's list possible combinations of two numbers first, then see how they can interact.\n\n83-82=1. That's useful. So maybe 1 is part of the equation.\n\nNow, how to use 96 and 69 to get something that when combined with 1 gives 1. Like 1 multiplied by something. So if the other part is 1, then 1*1=1. So how to get 1 from 96 and 69? Let's see: 69/69=1, but we need to use both 96 and 69. Alternatively, 96/96=1, but same problem. Wait, maybe (96 -69) / (96 -69) =27/27=1. But that uses 96 and 69 twice. Not allowed.\n\nAlternatively, 96 - (69 + something) =1. But the something would have to be 96 -69 -1=26. But we don't have 26. Unless we can make 26 from the other numbers, but they are already used in 83-82=1. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to structure the equation as (a - b) / (c - d) =1, where a, b, c, d are the four numbers. Let's try assigning:\n\nPossible pairs for a-b and c-d. Let's see:\n\nIf (96 -69) / (83 -82) =27/1=27. Not 1.\n\nIf (83 -82) / (96 -69) =1/27≈0.037. Not 1.\n\nIf (96 -83) / (82 -69) =13/13=1. Wait, 96-83=13, 82-69=13. So 13/13=1. Oh! That works. Let's check:\n\n96 -83 =13\n\n82 -69=13\n\nSo (96 -83)/(82 -69)=13/13=1.\n\nYes! So the equation is (96 -83)/(82 -69) =1. Let's verify:\n\nNumbers used: 96,83,82,69. All four, each once. Operations used: subtraction and division. That fits the requirements.\n\nSo the equation is (96 - 83) divided by (82 - 69) equals 1.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(96 - 83) / (82 - 69)</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using the numbers 95, 9, 97, and 89, each exactly once, and the result should be 272. The operations allowed are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Hmm, let's start by thinking about what combinations might get close to 272. \n\nFirst, maybe I can try adding some of the larger numbers together. Let's see, 95 + 97 is 192. Then adding 89 would get me 192 + 89 = 281. But that's using three numbers already. Then I have 9 left. To get from 281 to 272, I need to subtract 9. So maybe 95 + 97 + 89 - 9. Let's check that: 95+97 is 192, plus 89 is 281, minus 9 is 272. Wait, that actually works! But wait, let me check again. 95 + 97 is 192, plus 89 is 281. Then subtract 9 gives 272. Yeah, that seems right. But did I use all the numbers once? The numbers used are 95, 97, 89, and 9. Yes, all four numbers are used once each. So the equation would be (95 + 97 + 89) - 9. Wait, but parentheses aren't necessary here because addition and subtraction are left to right. So it's 95 + 97 + 89 - 9. Let me compute again to confirm:\n\n95 + 97 = 192\n192 + 89 = 281\n281 - 9 = 272.\n\nYes! That works. But wait, maybe there's another way, but this seems straightforward. Let me see if there's another possible combination just to be sure. For example, maybe using multiplication or division. Let's try some other options. Suppose I take 97 and 9. 97 - 9 is 88. Then 88 multiplied by something. If I do 88 * 3, that's 264, which is close. But how to get 3 from the remaining numbers 95 and 89. Hmm, 95 minus 89 is 6, which divided by 2 is 3, but I don't have a 2 here. Wait, but 95 minus 89 is 6. So maybe 88 * (6) would be 528, which is way over. Alternatively, maybe 97 * 9 = 873. Then subtract 95 and 89. Let's see: 873 - 95 -89. 873 -95 is 778, minus 89 is 689. Not close to 272. Hmm. Alternatively, 95 * 9 is 855. Then subtract 97 and 89: 855 -97=758-89=669. Nope. 89*9=801. Minus 95 and 97: 801-95=706-97=609. Still no. \n\nWhat about division? Let's say, maybe 97 divided by something. If I do 97 / 9, that's roughly 10.777. Not helpful. 95 / 9 is about 10.555. Maybe combining those. Not sure. Alternatively, 89 - 9 = 80. Then 80 * 3.4 = 272. But 3.4 would need to come from other numbers. 95 and 97. Let's see 95 +97 is 192. 192 divided by 80 is 2.4. So 80 * (192/80) = 192. No, that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe (95 - (9 * something)) * something else. Let's try. Suppose I do 9 * 97 = 873. Then 873 - 89 = 784. Then 784 - 95 = 689. Still too high. \n\nWait, maybe subtract two large numbers. 97 - 95 = 2. Then 89 - 9 = 80. Then 2 * 80 = 160. Not 272. Hmm. Alternatively, 97 + 95 = 192. 89 -9 =80. 192 +80=272. Wait, that's the same as the first solution. Wait, 97 +95 + (89 -9) = 97+95=192, 89-9=80. 192+80=272. So that's another way to write it, grouping the 89-9 first. So either way. So the equation could be 95 + 97 + (89 - 9) = 272. Or 95 +97 +89 -9. Both are valid. But since the problem says to return the equation using all numbers once, and order might not matter, but the way the numbers are arranged. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal numbers: 95,9,97,89. Using all of them once. So in the first approach: 95 +97 +89 -9. All four numbers are used. So that works. \n\nAlternatively, if I do (89 -9) +95 +97 = 80 +95 +97 = 272. Same thing. Either way, the numbers are all used once. So either equation is acceptable. But the question allows any order as long as each number is used once. So I can present it as 95 +97 +89 -9. Let me confirm once more. 95 +97 is 192, 192 +89 is 281, 281 -9 is 272. Exactly correct. So this equation works.\n</think>\n\n<answer>95 + 97 + 89 - 9 = 272</answer>"}]}

Hmm, 907 is a pretty big number, so I probably need to use multiplication to get there. Let me think about the numbers I have.\n\nFirst, looking at the largest number here is 351.

If I do 90 minus 14, that's 76. Then multiply by something? 76 times 2 is 152. Adding that to 351 gives 503. Still too low. Alternatively, maybe 90 multiplied by something. 90 times 14 is 1260. Then subtract 351? 1260 - 351 = 909. Oh, that's close! But 909 is just 2 more than 907. Wait, but I have a 2 left. So if I subtract 2 from 909, that would give me 907. But wait, let me check if I can use all the numbers here. Let's see:\n\nIf I do 90 * 14 = 1260. Then subtract 351, which is 909. Then subtract 2, which would be 907. But have I used all numbers? Yes: 90, 14, 351, and 2. Each used once. So the equation would be (90 * 14) - 351 - 2 = 907. Let me check the calculation again to make sure.\n\n90 times 14 is indeed 1260. 1260 minus 351 is 909. Then 909 minus 2 is 907. That works! And all numbers are used once. So that should be the answer. Let me just write that out properly with parentheses where needed. Since multiplication comes first, the equation would be (90 * 14) - 351 - 2 = 907. But wait, according to order of operations, the multiplication is done first even without parentheses, but adding them might make it clearer. So yeah, that should do it.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(90 * 14) - 351 - 2 = 907</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using the numbers 33, 42, 54, and 42, each exactly once, and the result should be 882. Hmm. Let's start by thinking about what operations can get me to 882. Since 882 is a pretty large number, maybe multiplication is involved here. Let me check what 42 times something would give. Well, 42 times 21 is 882. But how can I get 21 from the remaining numbers? Wait, I have two 42s. Oh, but I have to use all numbers once. Wait, the input numbers are 33, 42, 54, 42. So there are two 42s here. So I can use both 42s, each once. So maybe 42 multiplied by another 42 is 1764. That's too big. But maybe subtract something. Let me see: 42*42 is 1764. Then 1764 minus something. Let's see, 1764 - 882 = 882. But how to get that. Alternatively, maybe 54 times something. 54*16.333... is 882. Hmm, but 54*16 is 864, so not quite. Maybe divide 42 by something. Let me think. Alternatively, combine numbers with addition or subtraction first. Let's see, 54 + 42 = 96. Then 96 * 9.1667 is 880, which is close. Not helpful. Maybe 33 and 42. 33*42 is 1386. That's over 882. Then maybe subtract another number. 1386 - 54 = 1332, which is too much. Alternatively, 54*42 is 2268. Then divide by 33. 2268 / 33 ≈ 68.7, not helpful. Wait, maybe 33 and 54. 54-33=21. Then 21*42=882. Oh, wait! That's 21 times 42. But then where does the other 42 come in? Because we have two 42s. Wait, the problem says to use all numbers once. So the numbers are 33, 42, 54, 42. So if I do (54 - 33) * 42, that would be 21 * 42 = 882, but then I have an extra 42 left. Oh, right, so that's a problem. Because I need to use all four numbers. So perhaps that approach isn't valid. Let me think again. Maybe I need to combine all four numbers. Let's see. Maybe (54 + 42) * (42 - 33). Let's calculate that: 54+42=96, 42-33=9. 96*9=864. Close but not 882. How about 54*(42 - 33) + 42. That's 54*9 +42=486 +42=528. Not helpful. Alternatively, 54*42=2268. Then subtract 33*42=1386. 2268-1386=882. Wait, that's 54*42 - 33*42 = (54-33)*42 =21*42=882. Oh! But here I have used both 42s (since each term has a 42), and the numbers 54 and 33. So that's all four numbers: 54, 33, 42, 42. Yes! So the equation would be (54 × 42) − (33 × 42) = 882. Let me check that. 54 times 42 is 2268, 33 times 42 is 1386. Subtract them: 2268 minus 1386 equals 882. Yes! And all numbers are used exactly once. Perfect.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(54 * 42) - (33 * 42) = 882</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using the numbers 43, 15, 51, and 43, each exactly once, with basic operations to get 765. Hmm. First, 765 is a pretty big number, so probably multiplication will be involved. Let me check what 765 divided by some of these numbers gives.\n\nLet's see, 765 divided by 43. Let me calculate that. 43 times 17 is 731, because 40*17=680 and 3*17=51, so 680+51=731. Then 43*18 is 731+43=774. So 774 is 43*18. But 774 is 9 more than 765. So maybe that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe 43 times something else. Wait, maybe combining the numbers.\n\nWait, 43 and 43 are the same number. So maybe using both 43s together. Like 43 + 43 = 86, but then 86*15 is 1290, which is way over. 86*51 is way too big. Hmm. Alternatively, 43*43= 1849. That's way too big. Maybe subtract something. 1849 - 51 -15= 1849-66=1783, still way over.\n\nAlternatively, 51 is a larger number. Let's think about 51*15. That's 765. Wait, 51*15 equals 765? Let me check: 50*15=750, plus 1*15=15, so 750+15=765. Yes! So 51 multiplied by 15 is exactly 765. But wait, the problem says I have to use all the numbers: 43, 15, 51, 43. So if I do 51*15=765, but then I still have two 43s left. How can I include them?\n\nHmm. Maybe there's a way to have 51*15 plus or minus something involving the two 43s, but that would exceed the target. Alternatively, maybe subtract the two 43s in a way that cancels them out. Wait, if I do 51*15 + (43 -43), that would be 765 +0=765. But does that count? Let's check the rules. The user said each number can only be used once, and all must be used. So using both 43s as (43 -43) is allowed, since each is used once. Then the equation would be 51*15 + (43 -43) = 765. Let me verify:\n\n51*15 = 765. Then 43-43=0. So 765+0=765. Yes. That works. All numbers are used once, and the operations are allowed. So that's a possible equation.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's another way. Let me check. For example, 43*15 is 645. Then 51*43 is 2193. That's way over. Hmm. Alternatively, 43*(15 +51) = 43*66 = 2838. Then subtract the other 43? 2838 -43=2795. No, not helpful.\n\nAnother approach: 51 and 43. 51 +43=94. 94*15=1410. Then subtract 43: 1410-43=1367. No. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 43* (51 -15) = 43*36=1548. Then subtract the other 43: 1548-43=1505. Still not 765.\n\nWait, the first idea where I have 51*15 + (43 -43) seems valid. Let me check the rules again. Each number is used exactly once. So 51, 15, 43, and 43 are all used once. Yes. The operations are allowed. So that equation is (51 * 15) + (43 - 43) = 765. That should work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem requires that all numbers are used in the operations, but maybe not in a way that cancels them. But according to the problem statement, as long as each number is used once and all are used, it's acceptable. So that's a valid solution.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way without using subtraction to zero. Let me think. For example, 43*15=645. Then 645 +51 +43=645+94=739. Not enough. 43*15=645, then 51*43=2193. 2193 -645=1548. Not helpful. 43*(15 +51 +43) = way too big.\n\nAlternatively, 43 * (51 - (43 -15)). Let's compute inside the parentheses first: 43-15=28. Then 51 -28=23. Then 43*23= 989. Not 765. Hmm.\n\nWait, 51*15 is 765. So if I can somehow make 51*15 using all four numbers. But I already used 51 and 15. The two 43s are left. So combining them as 43-43=0. So the equation would be (51 * 15) + (43 - 43) = 765. That's the solution I thought of earlier.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (51 + 43) * (43 -15). Let's see. 51+43=94. 43-15=28. 94*28=2632. That's way over.\n\nAnother approach: 43*43= 1849. Then subtract 51*15=765. 1849-765=1084. No. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe (51 + 43) * 15 -43. Let's compute: 51+43=94. 94*15=1410. 1410-43=1367. Still not 765.\n\nHmm. Let me check 51*15=765. So the main problem is how to use the two 43s. Since they are the same number, subtracting them gives zero. So adding that zero doesn't change the result. So that's the most straightforward way. Therefore, the equation is 51*15 +43 -43 =765, which is the same as (51*15)+(43-43)=765. Either way, the numbers are all used once. I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(51 * 15) + (43 - 43) = 765</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using all the numbers 87, 522, 48, and 41 exactly once, and the result should be 428. Hmm. Let me start by thinking about how these numbers can combine with basic operations.\n\nFirst, I should consider the target number, 428. Let's see if there's a way to get close to that. Maybe start with the largest number, 522, and see how I can adjust it down. 522 minus something could work. Let's see, 522 - 94 would be 428. Do I have numbers that can make 94? The remaining numbers are 87, 48, and 41. Let's check: 87 + 48 is 135, which is too much. 48 + 41 is 89. Close to 94 but not quite. Maybe subtract: 87 - 41 is 46. Then 46 + 48 is 94. Wait, that's 94! So 522 - (87 - 41 + 48) = 522 - (46 + 48) = 522 - 94 = 428. Oh, that works! But wait, let me check if I used all numbers correctly. 87 is used in (87 - 41), then 48 is added. Then 522 is subtracted by that result. And 41 is used. So all numbers are used once: 522, 87, 48, 41. Yes. Let me write that equation: 522 - (87 - 41 + 48) = 522 - 94 = 428. But wait, the order of operations here. Parentheses first. So (87 - 41) is 46, then adding 48 gives 94. Subtracting that from 522 gives 428. Yes, that's correct. So the equation would be 522 - (87 - 41 + 48) = 428. Let me verify again:\n\n87 - 41 = 46\n\n46 + 48 = 94\n\n522 - 94 = 428. Perfect. All numbers used once. So the equation is 522 - (87 - 41 + 48) = 428. But maybe I can write it without the inner parentheses since addition and subtraction are left associative, but to be safe, parentheses are good here. Alternatively, 522 - 87 + 41 - 48, but that would be 522 -87=435, 435 +41=476, 476-48=428. Wait, that's a different approach. Let me check that: 522 -87 is 435, plus 41 is 476, minus 48 is 428. Oh, that's even simpler! So that would be 522 - 87 + 41 - 48 = 428. Let me verify:\n\n522 -87 = 435\n\n435 +41 = 476\n\n476 -48 = 428. Yes, that works. And all numbers are used once. So this equation uses all four numbers with subtraction and addition. So maybe that's a better way because it's more straightforward. So the equation is 522 - 87 + 41 - 48 = 428. Let me check if the order of operations is correct. Since there's only subtraction and addition, it's evaluated left to right. So yes, that works. Therefore, the equation would be (522 - 87) + (41 - 48) but no, actually, the way it's written without parentheses is correct. Let me just confirm:\n\n522 -87 is 435, plus 41 is 476, minus 48 is 428. Correct. So the equation is 522 -87 +41 -48 =428. That uses all numbers once, and the operations are + and -. So this seems to fit. Alternatively, maybe there's another way, but this works. Let me check if there's any other combination. For example, using multiplication or division. Let's think. Suppose I take 48 and 41. 48 * 41 is 1968. That's way too big. 522 divided by something. 522 / 87 is 6. Then 6 * 48 is 288. 288 +41 is 329. Not close. 87 * 48 = 4176, which is way too big. 522 - 48 = 474, then 474 -87 = 387, plus 41 is 428. Wait, 522 -48=474, 474 -87=387, 387 +41=428. That's another way. So equation: 522 -48 -87 +41 =428. Which is same as the previous one, just order of operations. Because subtraction is left associative. So 522 -48 is 474, then minus87 is 387, plus41 is 428. So yes, same result. So the equation can be written as 522 - 48 -87 +41. But in any case, the equation uses all numbers once with subtraction and addition. So either way, the answer would be 522 -87 +41 -48. Let me check the numbers again: 522, 87,41,48. All used once. Yes. So that's a valid equation. So the answer is 522 -87 +41 -48 =428.\n</think>\n\n<answer>522 - 87 + 41 - 48 = 428</answer>"}]}

I need to use all the numbers 36, 48, 93, and 18 exactly once each, with basic arithmetic operations to make 189. Hmm. Let's start by thinking about what operations could get me close. 189 is a bit less than 200, so maybe combining some of the larger numbers. Let's list the numbers again: 36, 48, 93, 18.\n\nFirst, 93 is the biggest number here. Maybe if I subtract something from 93 to get a smaller number, but not sure. Let's see. 93 plus something... 93 + 48 is 141, which is still under 189. 93 + 36 is 129. Then adding 18 would get 147. Still not enough. Maybe multiplication? Let's see.\n\nIf I multiply 36 and 48, that's 1728, which is way too big. How about 93 multiplied by something? 93 times 2 is 186, which is close to 189. Wait, but how to get 2 from the remaining numbers. Let's see. If I use 48, 18, and 36. Maybe 48 divided by something? 48 divided by 24 is 2, but I don't have 24. Wait, maybe 36 divided by 18 is 2. So if I take 93 multiplied by (36 / 18), that's 93*2=186. Then add 48? But I already used 48. Wait, no, I need to use all numbers. So 93*(36/18) + 48. Let's check: 36 divided by 18 is 2, 93*2 is 186, plus 48 is 234. That's too big. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 93 + 48 = 141. Then subtract something. If I subtract 36, that's 105. Not helpful. What if I multiply 93 and 18? 93*18 is 1674. That's way too big. Maybe divide instead. 93 divided by 18 is about 5.166... Not helpful. Maybe 48 divided by 18 is 2.666... Hmm.\n\nLet me try another approach. Let's see the target is 189. If I can split the numbers into parts that add up or multiply to 189. Let's think of 189 as 180 + 9. How to get 180 and 9 from the numbers. 36*5=180. But where's the 5? Maybe 48 - 93/18. Wait, 93 divided by 18 is 5.166..., so 48 minus that is around 42.833... Not helpful. Alternatively, 18*10 is 180. How to get 10? Maybe 36 - 48/ something. Wait, 48 divided by something... 48 divided by 16 is 3, but 16 isn't here. Alternatively, 93 - 48 = 45. Then 45*4=180, but we don't have a 4. Hmm.\n\nWait, 93 minus 36 is 57. 57 * 3 = 171. Then add 18 to get 189. But how to get 3 from 48 and 18? 48 divided by 16 is 3, but I don't have 16. Wait, 18 divided by 6 is 3. How to get 6? 36 divided by 6 is 6. But 36 is already being used. Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me try again.\n\nAnother idea: maybe 93 + 36 = 129. Then I need 60 more. 48 + 18 is 66. So 129 + 66 = 195. Close, but not 189. So 195 minus 6 is 189. But where to get the 6? Maybe using subtraction somewhere. Like 93 + 36 + (48 - 18) = 93 + 36 + 30 = 159. Not enough. Hmm.\n\nWait, what if I do 93 * (18 / (48 - 36))? Let's see. 48 - 36 is 12. 18 divided by 12 is 1.5. 93 * 1.5 is 139.5. Not helpful. Alternatively, (93 - 18) * (48 / 36). Let's compute: 93-18=75, 48/36=1.333..., 75*1.333...=100. Not 189. Hmm.\n\nMaybe multiplication and addition together. Like (36 + 48) * something. 36+48=84. 84*2=168. Then add 21 to get 189. But how to get 21 from 93 and 18. 93-72=21, but 72 is 18*4. So 93 - (18*4). But 18*4 is 72, which would require using 18 and 4, but we don't have a 4. Wait, maybe 93 - (18 * (36/ something)). Wait, 36 divided by 9 is 4. But we don't have a 9. Alternatively, 48/12=4. But 12 is 36-24. Not helpful. This is getting complicated.\n\nWait another angle: 189 divided by 3 is 63. So if I can get 63 three times, but I need to use all numbers. Maybe 93 - 48 = 45. Then 45 + 18 = 63. Then 63 * 3, but where's the 3? 36 divided by 12 is 3, but again, 12 is not here. Alternatively, 36 divided by 18 is 2. So 63 * (36/18) = 63*2=126. Not helpful.\n\nHmm. Let's try using division with larger numbers. For example, 93 * (48 / (something)). Let's see. If I divide 48 by a fraction made from 18 and 36. Maybe 48 divided by (36/18) is 48/2=24. Then 93*24=2232. Way too big. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe 93 + 48 + 36 + 18 = 195. That's over by 6. So maybe subtract 6 somewhere. But how? If instead of adding all, I subtract one. For example, 93 + 48 + 36 - 18 = 159. No. Not enough. Or 93 + 48 - 36 + 18 = 123. No. Not close.\n\nWait, 189 is 3*63. Maybe 93 - 30 = 63. Then 30 could be 48 - 18. So (93 - (48 - 18)) * 3. But 48 -18=30, 93-30=63, 63*3=189. But where do I get the 3? From 36 divided by 12, but 12 is not available. Wait, 36 divided by 12 is 3. But 12 is 36 - 24, but we don't have 24. Alternatively, 36 divided by 18 is 2. So 2 and then how to get 3? Not sure. Wait, maybe 36 / (something). If I use 36 divided by 12 to get 3, but we don't have 12. Hmm.\n\nWait, but I have to use all numbers. So if I do 93 - (48 -18) = 93 -30=63. Then multiply by (36 / 12). But I don't have 12. Wait, 36 divided by (48 - 36)= 36/12=3. Wait, 48 -36=12. So 36 / (48-36) =3. So then (93 - (48 -18)) * (36 / (48-36)) = 63 *3=189. But wait, here I'm using 48 twice: once in 48-18 and once in 48-36. But we can only use each number once. So that's a problem. Because 48 is used in two different operations. So that's invalid.\n\nSo that approach doesn't work because 48 is used more than once. Hmm. So I need to use each number exactly once. So maybe need to structure the equation without repeating numbers.\n\nLet me think again. Let's see, 93 + 48 =141. 141 + 36=177. 177 +18=195. That's over. Alternatively, 93 * 2=186, then +3=189. How to get 2 and 3 from 48, 36, 18. Maybe 36/18=2. Then 48-45=3, but 45 isn't available. Wait, 48 divided by 16=3, but no 16. Alternatively, 48 - (something)=3. Not sure.\n\nWait, 93 + (36 * (48 / 18)). Let's compute that. 48 divided by 18 is approximately 2.666..., then 36 * 2.666...=96. So 93 +96=189. Wait, that works! Let's check:\n\n48 divided by 18 is (48/18) = 16/6 = 8/3 ≈2.666...\n\n36 multiplied by (8/3) is 36*(8)/3 = 12*8 =96.\n\n93 +96=189. Yes! So the equation would be 93 + (36 * (48 / 18)) =189. Let's verify:\n\nFirst, 48 /18 = 2.666...\n\n36 * 2.666... =96.\n\n93 +96=189. Perfect. And all numbers are used exactly once: 93, 36, 48, 18. So the equation is 93 + 36 * (48 / 18) =189. But we need to make sure the order of operations is correct. Since multiplication and division are done before addition, the parentheses around 48/18 are sufficient. So that should be correct.\n</think>\n\n<answer>93 + 36 * (48 / 18) = 189</answer>"}]}

Let's start by thinking about possible combinations. \n\nFirst, maybe I can look for numbers that are close to each other or might subtract to get something near 165. Let's check the differences. For example, 229 is a large number. If I subtract something from it, maybe that could work. Let's see: 229 minus 58 is 171. Wait, but 171 is already one of the numbers. That might not help directly. Or maybe 229 minus 49 is 180. That's higher than 165. Then 180 minus 15 would be 165, but I don't have 15. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe multiply some numbers. Let's see. 58 times 3 is 174, which is close to 171. Wait, but 58*3 isn't one of the numbers here. Maybe not. Alternatively, 171 divided by something. 171 divided by, say, 1.03 (approx) would be 165, but getting that exact divisor from the other numbers is tricky.\n\nWhat if I use addition and subtraction? Let's see: 229 + 58 = 287. Then subtract 171: 287 - 171 = 116. Then add 49: 116 + 49 = 165. Wait, that would be 229 + 58 - 171 + 49. Let me check that. 229 +58 is 287. 287 -171 is 116. 116 +49 is 165. Yes! But wait, that uses all four numbers: 229, 58, 171, and 49. Each exactly once, and all operations are + and -. So the equation would be (229 + 58) - 171 + 49. Let me verify the order of operations. Since addition and subtraction are left associative, it would be ((229 + 58) - 171) +49. Let's compute step by step:\n\n229 +58 = 287\n\n287 -171 = 116\n\n116 +49 = 165. Perfect!\n\nSo that works. Wait, but does that use all numbers? Yes: 229, 58, 171, 49. All used once. Operations: +, -, +. So that's allowed. Let me check if there's any other way, but this seems straightforward. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me add them again: 229+58=287. Then 287-171=116. Then 116+49=165. Yep, that's correct. So the equation is (229 + 58) - 171 + 49. Alternatively, since order is left to right, maybe parentheses aren't necessary, but adding them for clarity. So maybe (229 + 58 - 171) +49. But either way, the numbers are all used once, and the result is 165.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(229 + 58) - 171 + 49 = 165</answer>"}]}

But the problem says each number can only be used once, so does that mean each instance of 26 is considered separate?

Hmm, where to start?\n\nFirst, maybe I should consider the target number, 336, and see if I can factor it to find possible multiplications. Let's factorize 336. 336 divided by 2 is 168, again by 2 is 84, by 2 again is 42, then 42 is 6*7. So prime factors are 2^4 * 3 * 7. Hmm, not sure if that helps directly, but maybe.\n\nLooking at the numbers given: 4, 50, 62, 42. Let's see possible multiplications. 50 and 62 are both large numbers. If I multiply 50 and 62, that's 3100, which is way bigger than 336. But maybe if I subtract something. Wait, 62 - 50 is 12, but 12 isn't directly helpful. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, 42 is close to 336 divided by 8, but 8 isn't one of the numbers. Wait, 4 is there. 4 * 84 = 336. Do I have 84? Well, 42 * 2 is 84, but I don't have 2. Alternatively, maybe 50 - 42 = 8, then 8 * 42 would be 336. But wait, 50 - 42 is 8, then 8 * 42 is 336. But that uses 50, 42, and 42, but we can only use each number once. So that won't work. Also, 42 is already part of the numbers we have to use, so maybe that's a path.\n\nWait, 4 is a small number. If I can get 84 multiplied by 4, that would be 336. But 84 can be made from 42 * 2, but again, 2 isn't available. Alternatively, 62 minus something equals 84? 62 is less than 84. Maybe 50 plus 42 is 92. 92 - 62 = 30. Not helpful.

But how to get 16.8 from 4 and 50? 50 divided by 4 is 12.5. 12.5 + 4.3 = 16.8. No, that's not possible. Alternatively, 50 - 4 = 46. 46 * 7.3 is 336. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let's try combining 50 and 4 first. 50 * 4 = 200. Then 336 - 200 = 136. Do I have 62 and 42 left. 62 + 42 = 104. Not 136. 62 * 42 is 2604, way too big. Hmm. 62 - 42 = 20. 200 + 20 = 220, still not 336.\n\nAlternatively, 50 + 62 = 112. Then 112 * 3 = 336. But where do I get 3? 42 divided by 14 is 3, but 14 isn't there. Or 42 - 4 = 38. Not helpful. Alternatively, 4 is there. 112 * (42 / 14) = 112*3=336. But 14 isn't present. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe 42 divided by something. 42 / 4 = 10.5. Then 10.5 * 32 = 336. 32 can be made from 50 - 18, but no.

How? 50 - 42 = 8, but 42 is already used. Wait, but 4, 50, 62. Maybe 62 - 50 = 12. 12 - 4 = 8. Then 8 * 42 = 336. Let's check: 62 - 50 = 12; 12 - 4 = 8; 8 * 42 = 336.

I need to create an equation using 39, 6, 73, and 53 exactly once each, with basic operations, to equal 819. Hmm. Let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, 819 is a pretty big number. Let me check what 73 multiplied by something might get close. 73 times 11 is 803, which is close. But I need 819. 73 times 11.2 or something, but fractions might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe combining multiplication and addition or subtraction.\n\nWait, 73 times 53. Let me calculate that. 70*53 is 3710, and 3*53 is 159, so total 3710+159=3869. That's way too big. So maybe not that.\n\nWhat about 39 times something. 39*21 is 819. Oh! 39 multiplied by 21 equals 819. So can I make 21 from 6, 73, and 53? Wait, but I have to use all four numbers. So the 39 is part of the multiplication to get to 819, and then I need to use 6, 73, 53 to make 21. Let me see.\n\nSo 39 * (something) = 819. The something has to be 21. So the remaining numbers: 6, 73, 53 need to combine to 21. Let's see. Let's try 73 - 53 = 20. Then 20 + 6 = 26. No. Not 21. Hmm. 73 minus 53 minus 6? 73-53=20, 20-6=14. Not helpful. Alternatively, 53 - 6 =47, then 73 -47=26. Still not 21.\n\nAlternatively, maybe division. Let's see. If I do 73 - (53 +6) = 14. Not 21. Hmm. What if 53 - (73/ something). Wait, 73 divided by something. Let's see, 73 divided by 6 is about 12.16. Then 53 minus that is around 40.84. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe 6 multiplied by something. For example, 6 * (something) to get part of the equation. Let's see. If I do 53 - (73 / 6). But 73 divided by 6 is not an integer. Let me check 73 divided by 6 is approximately 12.1667. Then 53 minus that is about 40.8333. Multiply by 6 gives 245, which is not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 73 - 53 = 20. Then 20 +6=26. 26 is still not 21. Hmm. What if I subtract 5? Wait, but I can't use numbers not given. Maybe using division. 73 - 53 =20. Then 20 + (6 divided by something). But I have to use all numbers. Wait, all numbers must be used once. So 39, 6,73,53. So if I use 39 in the multiplication part, the rest must form 21. So let's think again.\n\nIf I have to use 6,73,53 to form 21. Let's see. 53 minus 73 is negative 20. Then adding 6 gives -14. Not helpful. Alternatively, 73 - 53 is 20, then 20 plus (6 divided by something), but I can't use division unless another number is involved. Wait, but all numbers must be used once. So perhaps 73 - (53 -6) = 73 -47=26. Still not 21.\n\nWait, maybe (73 - 6) divided by something. 73-6=67. 67 divided by 53 is about 1.26. Not helpful. Or 53 divided by (73 -6)=53/67≈0.79. Then 6 times that is about 4.76. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 6 * (73 -53). That's 6*20=120. Then how to get from 120 to 21? No. Wait, but if the equation is 39 * (6 + (73 -53)/something). Wait, but that's getting complicated. Let me see. Let's try to get 21 from 6,73,53. Let's think of possible combinations.\n\nWait, 53 - (73 -6) =53 -67= -14. No. Hmm. What if (73 + 53) divided by 6? 73+53=126. 126 divided by 6 is 21. Oh! That's it! 126 divided by 6 is 21. So then 39 multiplied by that would be 39*21=819. So the equation would be 39 * ((73 +53)/6). Let me check:\n\n73 +53 = 126. 126 /6=21. 21 *39=819. Yes! That works. All numbers are used once: 39, 73,53,6. The operations are addition, division, and multiplication. So the equation is 39 × ((73 + 53) ÷ 6) =819. Let me verify the arithmetic again:\n\n73+53 =126. 126 divided by6 is 21. 21 multiplied by39: 20*39=780, 1*39=39, total 819. Perfect. So that's the equation.\n</think>\n\n<answer>39 * ((73 + 53) / 6) = 819</answer>"}]}

Let's see.\n\nFirst, I should check what 588 is. Let me factor it. 588 divided by 12 is 49, so 12*49. Or 28*21, since 28*20 is 560, plus 28 is 588. Wait, 28 times 21 is 588. Hmm. So if I can get 21 from the other numbers: 6, 92, 64. Let me see. How can I combine 6, 92, and 64 to make 21? That might be tricky. Alternatively, maybe another approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 6 multiplied by something. Let's see. 6*98 is 588. So if I can get 98 from 28, 92, 64. But wait, I need to use all numbers. So 6* (some combination of 28,92,64) = 588. Let's check 6*98 =588. So how can I get 98 from 28,92,64 using the remaining numbers.\n\nWait, 28 is already in the list. So maybe 92 - 64 is 28, but that would use 92 and 64. Then 28 + (92 -64) would be 56, but that's not helpful. Wait, maybe 92 + something. Let's see. 92 + 6 =98. But 6 is already used. Hmm.\n\nWait, the numbers I have left after using 6 would be 28,92,64. If I need to make 98 from those. Let's see: 92 + (64 -28) = 92 + 36 =128. No. 64 +28=92. So 64 +28=92. Then 92 + something else? But that uses up 64 and 28. Then maybe (64 +28) + something. But I already used 6, 28, 64, 92. Wait, but if I do 6 * (92 + (something)), but I need to use 28 and 64.\n\nAlternatively, 6 * 92 is 552. Then 552 + 36=588. 36 can be 64 -28. So 6*92 + (64-28) = 552 +36=588. Let's check that. 6*92=552, 64-28=36, 552+36=588. That uses all numbers: 6,92,64,28. Yes. So that would be (6 * 92) + (64 -28) = 588.\n\nLet me verify:\n\n6 * 92 = 552\n\n64 -28 =36\n\n552 +36=588. Yep, that works. So the equation is 6*92 +64 -28. But since subtraction is involved, maybe parentheses are needed to ensure the order. Wait, according to order of operations, multiplication comes first, so 6*92 is 552, then adding 64 gives 616, then subtracting 28 would be 588? Wait, wait, no. If the equation is written as 6*92 +64 -28, then according to the order, it's (6*92) +64 -28. So 552 +64=616, 616-28=588. Oh, right! That's another way. So using all four numbers: 6,92,64,28. So 6*92 +64 -28=588.\n\nWait, that's even simpler. Let me check again:\n\n6*92=552\n\n552 +64=616\n\n616-28=588. Yes. So that's correct. But does that use all numbers once? 6,92,64,28. Yes. So that's a valid equation. So the equation is (6 * 92) + 64 -28 =588. But since parentheses aren't needed for multiplication first, but maybe to clarify. Alternatively, 6*92 + (64 -28) would be the same as 6*92 +64 -28. But either way, both expressions evaluate to 588. So perhaps the simplest way is to write 6*92 +64 -28. But let me check if there's another way.\n\nAlternatively, 28*21=588. So can I get 21 from 6,92,64. 92 -64=28, then 28 -6=22. Not 21. Hmm. 64/ something. 64 divided by something. 64/ (92/21) is not helpful. Maybe (92 - (64 +6)) = 92 -70=22. Not 21. Hmm. Not helpful.\n\nAnother approach: 64*9=576, 576 +12=588. But how to get 9 and 12 from 28,6,92. Maybe 28 - (92/ something). 92 divided by 6 is about 15. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 92*6=552. Then 64 -28=36. 552+36=588. Wait, that's the same as the first approach. So that works. So 92*6 + (64-28)=588.\n\nSo the equation can be written as 92*6 +64 -28 =588. Alternatively, (6*92) + (64 -28) =588. Both are valid. So either way.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 6*92 +64 -28, which uses all the numbers once and equals 588.\n</think>\n\n<answer>6 * 92 + 64 - 28</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using the numbers 400, 40, 44, and 22, each exactly once, with basic operations to get 20. Hmm. Let me start by listing the numbers and thinking about possible combinations.\n\nFirst, 400 is a big number. Maybe I can divide it by something. If I divide 400 by 40, that gives me 10. Then I have 44 and 22 left. Wait, 44 divided by 22 is 2. So 10 plus 2 is 12. That's not 20. Not quite. Alternatively, 400 divided by 20 is 20, but I don't have 20; I have 22. Hmm. Wait, maybe subtract something. Let's try different operations.\n\nWhat if I take 44 and subtract 22 to get 22. Then 40 divided by that 22 would be... like 1.818, which doesn't help. Maybe 44 minus 40 is 4. Then 400 divided by 4 is 100. Then 100 divided by 22 is around 4.5. Not helpful. Maybe another approach.\n\nLet me see: 22 and 44. 44 divided by 22 is 2. So that's 2. Then I have 400 and 40. If I subtract 40 from 400, that's 360. 360 divided by 2 is 180. No. Not 20. Alternatively, 40 divided by (44 - 22) would be 40/22 ≈ 1.818. Then 400 divided by that is about 219. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe combine 40 and 22 first. 40 minus 22 is 18. Then 44 divided by something. Let me see: 400 divided by (44 - (40 - 22))? Let's calculate that. 40-22 is 18, then 44-18 is 26. 400/26 is about 15.38. Not 20. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 400 divided by (40 + (44/22)). Let's compute 44/22=2. Then 40+2=42. 400/42≈9.523. No. Not 20.\n\nWait, what if I use multiplication? 22 times something. 22*2=44, but maybe that's not helpful. Let's think: 22*40=880. Then subtract 400? 880-400=480. Then 480 divided by 44 is about 10.9. Not 20.\n\nAlternatively, 400 - (44 - 22) * 40. Let's see: 44-22=22, 22*40=880. 400-880= -480. Nope.\n\nWait, maybe 40 divided by 22 gives a fraction. 40/22 is 20/11. Then 400 divided by that would be 400*(11/20) = 220. Then 220 plus 44 is 264. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, (400 - 44) divided by (40 - 22). Let's compute 400-44=356. 40-22=18. 356/18≈19.777... Close to 20 but not exactly. Hmm. Maybe that's a possible path. Maybe I can adjust.\n\nWait, 400 - 44 is 356, and 40 - 22 is 18. 356 divided by 18 is 19.777..., which is approximately 20 but not exact. So maybe that's not the right approach.\n\nAnother angle: 44 divided by 22 is 2. Then 400 divided by 40 is 10. Then 10 multiplied by 2 is 20. Wait! That could work. Let me check:\n\n44 / 22 = 2\n\n400 / 40 = 10\n\nThen 10 * 2 = 20. But the problem says I have to use all four numbers in the equation. So, combining these operations, how can I structure that using all four numbers?\n\nSo maybe (400 / 40) * (44 / 22). Let's compute that: 400/40=10, 44/22=2, then 10*2=20. Yes! That uses all four numbers: 400,40,44,22. Each used once. And the operations are division and multiplication. So the equation is (400 / 40) * (44 / 22) = 20. Let me check the math again. 400 divided by 40 is 10. 44 divided by 22 is 2. 10 times 2 is indeed 20. Perfect!\n</think>\n\n<answer>(400 / 40) * (44 / 22)</answer>"}]}

Let me start by thinking about how these numbers can combine. \n\nFirst, 432 is a large number, so maybe I can subtract something from it to get closer to 238. But 432 minus what? Let's see. If I subtract 51, that gives 381, which is still too big. If I subtract 63, that's 432 - 63 = 369. Still way over. Maybe 432 - (32*6), but 32 is one of the numbers. Wait, maybe if I use division or multiplication to reduce 432.\n\nAlternatively, maybe combine 432 with another number first. For example, 432 divided by something. 432 divided by 32 is 13.5. Hmm, not sure if that's helpful. 432 divided by 51 is approximately 8.47. Not helpful. 432 divided by 63 is around 6.857. Still not helpful. Maybe multiply 432 by a small number? But we have to use all numbers once. \n\nWait, perhaps using 432 and 63 together. 432 - 63 = 369. Then subtract something else. 369 - 51 = 318. Still too high. Then subtract 32 gives 286. Not 238. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe add 432 and 63: 495. Then subtract 51 and 32: 495 - 51 -32 = 412. Still not.\n\nWhat if I use multiplication? Let's see. 51 multiplied by something. 51*4 is 204. If I can get 51*4 + something, but 204 +34=238, but I don't have 34. Alternatively, 51*5=255, which is over. \n\nHow about 63*4=252. 252 -14=238. But 14 is not available. Alternatively, 63*3=189. 189 +49=238. Still no 49. \n\nLet me think about 32. Maybe 32*7=224. 224 +14=238. Again, 14 is missing. Or 32*8=256. 256 -18=238. No 18. \n\nWait, maybe combining 51 and 32. 51 +32=83. 432 -83=349. Then subtract 63: 349-63=286. Not 238.\n\nAlternatively, 51 -32=19. Then 432 -19=413. 413 -63=350. Nope.\n\nHow about (432 divided by something) to get a smaller number. 432 / 32 is 13.5. Then 13.5 * 51 = 688.5. Too big. 432 /51 is approx 8.47. 8.47*63=533. Not helpful.\n\nMaybe 432 divided by (something minus something). Let's try 63 -32=31. Then 432 /31≈13.935. Not helpful. 51 -32=19. 432/19≈22.73. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, 432 - (51 +63) =432-114=318. Then 318 -32=286. Still no.\n\nWait, maybe using multiplication and subtraction. Let's try 432 - (51* something). 51*4=204. 432-204=228. Then 228 +10=238. But 10 isn't available. However, I have 63 and 32 left. Wait, 63-32=31. But 228 +31=259. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 51*5=255. 255 -17=238. But 17 isn't there. 63-32=31. 255 -31=224. No.\n\nHmm. Maybe 63*32=2016. That's way too big. But divided by something. 2016 /432=4.666. Not helpful. 2016 /51≈39.53. Not helpful.\n\nWhat if I do 63 +51=114. 114*2=228. Then 228 +10=238. Still need 10. Alternatively, 63 -51=12. 12* something. Maybe 432/12=36. 36* something? Not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps 432 divided by 32 is 13.5. Then 13.5 * 63 = 850.5. Then subtract 51: 850.5 -51=799.5. No.\n\nAlternatively, (63 +51) * something. 63+51=114. 114*2=228. 228 +10=238. Again, 10 missing. But 32 is left. Wait, 32 - (something)=10. 32-22=10. But no 22.\n\nAlternatively, 32/ something. 32/ (51- something). Wait, maybe this is getting too convoluted.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Let's see if I can get 238 by combining operations. For example, 238= 240 -2. Maybe 240 is 32*7.5. But 7.5 isn't an integer. Alternatively, 51*4=204. 204 +34=238. 34 can be 63 -29, but 29 is not available. 63 -32=31. 204 +31=235. Close. Then +3=238. But where to get 3?\n\nAlternatively, 51*4=204. Then 204 +32=236. Then 236 +2=238. But 2 is not available. Wait, 63 divided by 32 is approximately 1.968. If I use 63/32, that's about 1.968. Then 204 + (63/32) +32? Not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps using 63*32=2016. Then 2016 divided by something. 2016 /432=4.666. 4.666*51≈238. Let me check: 2016 divided by 432 is 4.666... multiplied by 51. 4.666*51=238. Exactly! Wait, let me calculate that again.\n\n2016 divided by 432 is indeed 4.666... (which is 14/3). Then 14/3 *51= (14*51)/3= 714/3=238. Yes! That works. So the equation would be (63*32)/432 *51=238. Let me check the numbers: 63*32=2016, 2016/432=4.666..., 4.666...*51=238. \n\nBut wait, the problem states that each number can be used once and all must be used. In this equation, 63,32,432,51 are all used once. The operations are multiplication, division, and multiplication again. So the equation would be ((63 * 32) / 432) * 51 = 238. Let me verify:\n\n63 *32 = 2016\n\n2016 /432 = 4.666...\n\n4.666... *51 = 238.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the equation is ((63 * 32) / 432) * 51. But wait, parentheses are important here. Let me structure it properly. It should be (63 × 32 ÷ 432) × 51. Since all operations are left to right, but division comes after multiplication. Alternatively, (63 * 32) / (432 / 51). Let me check that:\n\n432 /51 ≈8.470...\n\n63*32=2016\n\n2016 /8.470≈238. So that works too. But how to write it. The original equation would be (63 *32)/(432 /51) = 2016/(432/51) =2016*(51/432)= (2016/432)*51=4.666...*51=238. So that's another way. Which uses all numbers once. So the equation is (63 * 32) / (432 / 51) =238.\n\nYes, this uses all numbers once and results in 238. Let me confirm:\n\nFirst, 432 divided by 51 is approximately 8.470588.\n\nThen 63 multiplied by 32 is 2016.\n\n2016 divided by (432/51) is 2016 * (51/432) = (2016/432)*51 = 4.666...*51 = 238. Exactly.\n\nSo the equation is (63 × 32) ÷ (432 ÷ 51) = 238. That works. All numbers used once, operations are division and multiplication.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(63 * 32) / (432 / 51) = 238</answer>"}]}

But how?\n\nWait, 91 is another big number. If I subtract something from 91 to get 84, then 91 - 7 = 84. But where do I get 7 from? 56 and 49... 56 - 49 = 7. Oh, maybe that's a way.

Hmm.\n\nFirst, let me think about the target number, 598. Maybe I can get close to that by combining some of the larger numbers first. The biggest number here is 587. If I subtract something from 587, maybe? Let's see: 587 - something. If I subtract 587 - (52 + 42 + 1), that's 587 - 95, which is 492. That's way too low. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, adding 587 and 42 gives 629. Then maybe subtract something. 629 - 52 = 577. Still not 598. How about 629 - (52 - 1) = 629 - 51 = 578. Not enough. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe multiplication. 52 times something. Let's see. 52 * 11 is 572. Close to 598, but not there. 52 * 12 is 624. Hmm. 52 * 11.5 would be around 598, but we can't use fractions. Maybe combining operations.\n\nAlternatively, 52 multiplied by 42. That's 2184. Way too big. Maybe subtract that from 587? 587 - 2184 is negative. Not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps divide. Let's see. 587 divided by something. 587 / 1 is 587. Then add 52 and 42. 587 + 52 = 639, plus 42 is 681. No. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 587 - (42 / 1) = 587 -42=545. Then add 52: 545+52=597. Oh, that's very close to 598. Only one off. But how? If I can adjust that. Wait, 587 - (42 / 1) +52 =597. So maybe if I can get an extra 1 somewhere. But the 1 is already used in 42/1. Wait, but maybe change the order. Let's see: 587 + (52 - (42 /1))? That would be 587 + (52-42) =587+10=597. Still one short. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe multiply 42 and 1. 42*1=42. Then 587 +52 -42=587+10=597. Still same problem.\n\nWait, maybe we can use subtraction and division differently. Let me try another approach. Let's think of 587 + something equals 598. 587 +11=598. So how can I get 11 using the remaining numbers 52, 1, 42. Wait, 52 -42=10, plus 1=11. So 587 + (52 -42 +1)=587+11=598. Yes! Let me check. The numbers used would be 587, 52, 42, 1. Each used once. The operations: 52-42=10, 10+1=11, then 587+11=598. But wait, parentheses? Let me write it as 587 + (52 - 42 + 1) =598. So the equation is 587 + 52 - 42 + 1 =598. Wait, but order of operations would just go left to right, but adding and subtracting. So 587 +52=639, minus42=597, plus1=598. Yes! So that works. Let me verify: 587 +52 =639, 639 -42=597, 597 +1=598. Correct. All numbers used once, operations are addition and subtraction. So the equation is 587 +52 -42 +1=598. So in the required format, maybe parentheses aren't needed, but to group them as (587 +52) -42 +1. Or perhaps write it without parentheses since addition and subtraction are left associative. So the answer would be 587 + 52 - 42 + 1. Let me check again: all numbers used once, yes. 587,52,42,1. All operations are + and -, which is allowed. Yep, that works.\n</think>\n\n<answer>587 + 52 - 42 + 1 = 598</answer>"}]}

Let's see... I can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, division. Hmm.\n\nFirst, maybe I should try to get close to 241 by combining the larger numbers. Let's see, 73 and 72 are the two biggest. If I subtract them, 73 - 72 = 1. That's too small. If I add them, 73 + 72 = 145. Still not close. Multiply them? 73*72 is 5256, way too big. So maybe that's not the way to go.\n\nWhat about 70 and 26? Let's see. 70 + 26 = 96. 70 - 26 = 44. 70*26 = 1820, way too big. 70/26 ≈ 2.69. Not helpful. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe combine some of these operations. Let's think: 241 is a prime number, right? So maybe it's a matter of combining the numbers in a way that when multiplied or divided, they get close. Let's see. Let's try to use multiplication and then add or subtract.\n\nFor example, 73*3 is 219, but how to get 3 from the remaining numbers? Maybe 72 - 70 + 26. Wait, but that uses all numbers except 73. Wait, no, I need to use all numbers. So each number must be used once.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe 70 * 3 = 210. Then 210 + 31 = 241. But where do I get 31 from? Maybe 73 - (72 - 26). Let's check: 72 -26 =46, then 73 -46=27. 70*3 is 210, 210+27=237. Not quite. Close, but not 241.\n\nWait, let's see. What if I do 73*3 + something. But how to get 3? Maybe 72/24. But 24 isn't directly available. Wait, 26 is there. Maybe 72/(26- something). Hmm. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 72*3=216. Then 216 +25=241. How to get 25? 73 -70=3, then 3 +22=25. But 22 would need to come from 26, maybe 26 -4. But 4 from where? Not sure. This seems messy.\n\nWait, let's try 73 * (something) plus or minus another. For instance, 73*3 + 70 - 26. Wait, but how to get 3? 72 divided by 24. But 24 is not here. Alternatively, 72 - 70 = 2. Then 26 - 2 =24. Maybe that's not helpful.\n\nWait another angle: Let's use 70 and 26 together. 70 -26=44. Then 73 +72=145. 145 +44=189. Not enough. Hmm. How about multiplying 70 and 26? 70*26=1820. Then 1820 divided by something. If I divide by 73, that's like 24.9... Not helpful. Divided by 72? 1820/72≈25.27. Still not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 73 * 3 =219. Then 219 + 22=241. 22 could be 72 - 50. But 50 would come from 70 -20, but 20 is not there. Alternatively, 26 + (70 -72). Hmm, 70-72=-2. So 26-2=24. Then 219+24=243. Close but not 241.\n\nWait, 73*3 + (72 -70) =219 +2=221. Still not. Then 221 +20=241. But where to get 20? 26-6=20. But 6 from where? Maybe 72/12, but no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 72 * 3 =216. Then 216 +25=241. How to get 25? 73 -70=3, then 26 -3=23. Not 25. Hmm.\n\nWait, let's try division. For example, 72 divided by something. 72/ (26 - something). Let's see. If I do 72/(70 - something). Wait, but 70 and 26 are separate. Maybe 72/(70/26). Let's compute that: 70/26 ≈2.692. Then 72 divided by that is about 26.73. Then 73 - 26.73≈46.27. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 73 +72=145. Then 70 +26=96. 145 +96=241. Wait, that's 145+96=241? Wait 145 +96 is 241. Yes! Let's check: 73+72=145, 70+26=96. 145+96=241. Wait, but that uses all numbers once. Wait, 73,72 added, and 70,26 added. Then sum both. So the equation would be (73 +72) + (70 +26) =241. But can we write that with just the operations? Since all numbers are used once. Let me check: 73 +72 +70 +26. Wait, that's 73+72=145, 145+70=215, 215+26=241. Oh! So actually, if you just add all four numbers together: 73 +72 +70 +26. Let me compute that: 73+72 is 145, 145+70 is 215, 215+26 is 241. Wait, that works? But why didn't I think of that earlier? Because the problem says \"create an equation that equals 241\" using all numbers once with basic operations. So adding all four numbers gives 241. Let me verify the sum again. 73+72=145, 145+70=215, 215+26=241. Yes! So the equation is 73 +72 +70 +26 =241. But wait, that uses only addition, which is allowed. So the answer is simply the sum of all four numbers. But why is that possible? Let me check the numbers again: 73,72,70,26. Their sum is 73+72=145; 145+70=215; 215+26=241. Yes. So this works. But maybe I didn't realize because the numbers sum up directly. So perhaps the answer is just adding them all. But the problem didn't specify that you can't just add all, right? Let me check the original problem: \"You can use basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) one or multiple times but each number can only be used once, and you must use all the numbers.\" So addition is allowed multiple times. So 73 +72 +70 +26 is a valid equation. Therefore, that's the answer. But maybe I need to check if that's correct. Let me re-sum: 73 +72 is 145. 145 +70 is 215. 215 +26 is 241. Yes. So the equation is correct. So that's the solution. I thought it would be more complicated, but it's just adding all numbers. Maybe the problem was designed that way. But why the numbers sum up to exactly 241? Let me check again: 73 +72 =145. 70+26=96. 145+96=241. Yes. So that's correct.\n</think>\n\n<answer>73 + 72 + 70 + 26 = 241</answer>"}]}

Let me start by thinking about the possible operations and how these numbers can interact.\n\nFirst, let me list out the numbers: 12, 44, 5, 22. I need to use each once. Hmm, 120 isn't a huge number, so maybe subtraction or division could help reduce larger numbers. But 44 is the biggest here. Let's see.\n\nPerhaps multiplying some numbers and then adding or subtracting others. Let's try combinations. For example, 44 and 5: 44*5 is 220. Then maybe subtract something. If I subtract 22, that's 220-22=198. Still too big. Then there's 12 left. Maybe 198 -12=186, not 120. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, 44 divided by something. 44 divided by 22 is 2. Then 12*5 is 60. 60*2 would be 120. Wait, that could work. Let me check:\n\n44 / 22 = 2. Then 12 * 5 = 60. Then 60 * 2 = 120. But I have to use all numbers and each once. So putting it together: (12 * 5) * (44 / 22). That uses all four numbers. Let's compute:\n\n12*5=60, 44/22=2, then 60*2=120. Yes! That works. Let me verify:\n\nNumbers used: 12, 5, 44, 22. All used once. Operations: *, /, and another *. So the equation would be (12 * 5) * (44 / 22) = 120.\n\nAlternatively, written as 12 * 5 * (44 / 22). Either way. Let me check if there's another possible combination. Maybe another way? For example, 22 -12=10, 44 -5=39. 10*39=390. Not helpful. Or 44 - (22 +12)=10, then 10*5=50. No. Maybe 44 +22=66, 12*5=60. 66+60=126. Close but not 120. \n\nAnother approach: 44 - 22 =22, 22 *5=110, 110 +12=122. Still off by 2. Alternatively, 44 +22=66, 66 -5=61, 61*12=732. Not helpful. \n\nWhat if I use division with 5? Like 44 divided by something. 44 divided by 5 is 8.8, which might complicate things. But maybe 44 divided by (22 -12)=10, so 44/10=4.4. Then 4.4 *5=22. Not helpful. Hmm.\n\nWait, the first idea seems to work. Let me confirm again: 12*5 is 60, 44 divided by 22 is 2, then 60*2=120. All numbers used once, operations are multiplication and division. That should be the answer.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(12 * 5) * (44 / 22) = 120</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using 61, 53, 9, and 13, each exactly once, with basic arithmetic operations, to get 589. Hmm. Let's start by thinking about what operations might lead to 589. \n\nFirst, 589 is a bit over 500. Let me check the numbers. 61 and 53 are both in the 50-60 range, and 13 and 9 are smaller. Maybe multiplying some of the larger numbers and then adding or subtracting the others? Let's try some combinations.\n\nIf I multiply 61 by 9, that's 549. Then maybe add 53 minus 13? Wait, 549 + 53 is 602, and 602 -13 is 589. Wait, but that uses 61,9,53,13. Let me check: 61*9 +53-13. Let's calculate step by step. 61*9 is 549. 549 +53 is 602. 602-13 is 589. Oh, that works! So the equation would be 61*9 +53 -13. But wait, do I need to use all numbers once? Yes. Let's check each number: 61, 9, 53, 13. All used once. The operations are multiplication, addition, subtraction. So that should work. Let me verify again: 61*9 is 549. Then 549 +53 is 602, minus 13 is 589. Perfect.\n\nWait, but does the order of operations matter here? Let's see. If written as 61*9 +53 -13, multiplication comes first, then addition and subtraction left to right. So yes, that's correct. Alternatively, parentheses might be added for clarity, but since multiplication has higher precedence, it's okay. So the equation is (61 × 9) + 53 - 13 = 589. But maybe the user doesn't require parentheses. Let me check again. 61*9 is 549. 549 +53 is 602. 602-13 is 589. Exactly. So the equation is 61*9 +53 -13. Let me just make sure I can't find another way, but this seems to work. Let me check if I can use division or other operations, but this seems straightforward. Alternatively, maybe 53*11. But 11 isn't part of the numbers. Wait, 53* (13 - 9) +61? Let's see: 13-9=4. 53*4=212. 212+61=273. No, that's too low. Alternatively, 53* (61 / something). Let's see. 61 divided by, say, 13? 61/13 is about 4.69. 53*4.69 is around 248.5. Then adding 9? That's 257.5. Not helpful. Alternatively, 61*(13 - something). Let's see, 13-9=4. 61*4=244. 244 +53=297. No. Hmm. Another approach: 53*11. But again, 11 isn't available. Wait, maybe 53*11. Well, 53*11 is 583. Then adding 6: 583+6=589. But 6 isn't here. Wait, but maybe using 9 and 13 to make 6? 9- (13/ something). Not sure. Alternatively, 53*11 + 6. But I don't have those numbers. Alternatively, 53* (something) + something else. Let me think. The first solution I had seems correct. Let me just confirm once again: 61×9=549. 549+53=602. 602-13=589. Yes. All numbers used once. So the equation is 61×9 +53 -13 =589.

I need to make an equation using 9, 45, 2, and 42, each exactly once, with basic operations, and the result should be 420. Hmm.\n\nFirst, 420 is a pretty big number. Let me think about the factors. 420 divided by 42 is 10. Wait, 42 is one of the numbers. If I can get 10 using the remaining numbers (9, 45, 2), then multiplying by 42 might work. Let's check.\n\nSo remaining numbers are 9, 45, 2. How to make 10? Let's see. 45 divided by something. 45 divided by 9 is 5. Then 5 plus 2 is 7. Not 10. Or 45 minus 9 is 36, which doesn't help. 9 minus 2 is 7. Not helpful. Maybe 9 * 2 = 18, then 45 - 18 = 27. Still not 10. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe subtract. 45 - (9 + 2) = 45 -11=34. Not 10. What if I do 9 + (45 / something). 45 divided by 5 is 9, but I don't have a 5. Wait, 45 divided by 9 is 5. Then 5 + 2 is 7. So that's 7. Not 10. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 45 / (9 - 2). 9-2=7. 45/7 is about 6.428... Not helpful.\n\nHmm. Maybe this approach isn't working. Let's think differently. What if I use multiplication? 45 * 9 is 405. Then 405 + 42 is 447, but we still need to use 2. Maybe 447 - 2=445. Not 420. Alternatively, 45 * 9 = 405. Then 42 - 2 = 40. 405 + 40=445. Still not. \n\nWait, 420 is 42*10, but maybe another way. 420 is 14*30, 20*21, etc. Let's see if other combinations can reach 420. For example, 45 and 9: 45*9=405. Then 405 + 15=420. But how to get 15 from 42 and 2? 42-2=40. No. 42/2=21. 21. 405+21=426. Not quite. \n\nAlternatively, 45 * 10=450. Then 450 - 30=420. How to get 10 and 30 from remaining numbers. Wait, original numbers are 9,45,2,42. If I use 45*10, but 10 would need to be made from 9 and 2, like 9+2=11, not 10. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe 45 * (9 + 2) =45*11=495. Then subtract 42? 495 -42=453. No. Not 420.\n\nAlternatively, 42* (something). 42*10 is 420. Let's see if I can get 10 from 9,45,2. 45 divided by 9 is 5. 5 + 2 is 7. Not 10. 45 - (9*2)=45-18=27. 42*27=1134, way too big. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe combine 9 and 2 first. 9*2=18. Then 45 +18=63. 63*42=2646. No. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe using division. 420 can be made by 45*9 + something. 45*9=405. 420-405=15. So need 15 from 42 and 2. 42/2=21. 405+21=426. Close, but not 420. 42-2=40. 405+40=445. No.\n\nAlternatively, 45*(42/ something). Let's see. 42 divided by 2 is 21. 45*21=945. Then subtract 9? 945-9=936. No. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe (45 - 9) * (42 - 2). Let's calculate that. 36 *40=1440. That's way over.\n\nAnother approach: 420 is 42*10. How to get 10 from 9,45,2. Let's see. 45 divided by 9 is 5. 5*2=10. Oh! Wait, that's possible. So 45 divided by 9 is 5, then multiply by 2 to get 10. Then multiply by 42. So 42 * ( (45 /9 ) * 2 ). Let's check: 45/9=5, 5*2=10, 10*42=420. Yes! But wait, are all numbers used exactly once? 42,45,9,2. Yes. So the equation would be 42 * ( (45 / 9 ) * 2 ). Which simplifies to 42 * (5 * 2) = 42*10=420. \n\nSo the equation is 42 * (45 / 9 * 2) = 420. Let me check the order of operations. Division and multiplication left to right. So 45 divided by 9 is 5, multiplied by 2 is 10, then multiplied by 42 is 420. Perfect. That uses all numbers once with basic operations. So the equation is (45 / 9 * 2) * 42 = 420. Alternatively, could write it as 42 * (45 / 9) * 2. But order might not matter. Let me verify:\n\nCalculating step by step:\n\n45 / 9 =5\n\n5 *2=10\n\n10 *42=420. Yes.\n\nSo the equation would be (45 / 9 * 2) * 42 = 420. Or maybe without the parentheses if order is correct. But to ensure the operations are grouped correctly, adding parentheses might be better. So ((45 / 9) * 2) *42. Or 45 /9 *2 *42. Since multiplication and division are left associative, 45 /9 is 5, multiplied by 2 is 10, multiplied by 42 is 420. So maybe it's okay without parentheses. But to make it clear, perhaps including them. Alternatively, 42 * 2 * (45 /9). Wait, that's 42*2=84, 84*(5)=420. That works too. So 42*2*(45/9). Let's check: 45/9=5, 42*2=84, 84*5=420. Yes. So that's another way. But which one uses the numbers in order? Either way, all numbers are used once. So possible equations could be (45 / 9) * 2 *42 or 42 * 2 * (45 /9). Both are valid. So either would work. The parentheses might be necessary for clarity. Let me pick one. Let's go with (45 / 9 * 2) * 42 =420. So the equation is (45/9*2)*42. But since * and / are same precedence, left to right. So parentheses might not be necessary around 45/9*2, but adding them for clarity. Alternatively, 45/9=5, 5*2=10, 10*42=420. So the equation is (45 / 9) * 2 *42. But written in LaTeX, maybe with parentheses. So (45 ÷ 9 × 2) × 42. But in the required format, using * and /.\n\nSo the answer would be (45 / 9 * 2) * 42. Or 42 * (45 / 9) * 2. Either way. Let's just check the operations again. Either way, the result is correct. Let me write it as (45 / 9 * 2) * 42. So that's the equation.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(45 / 9 * 2) * 42</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using all the numbers 350, 74, 12, and 18 exactly once, with basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) to get 640. Hmm. Let me start by thinking about the target number, 640. What's 640 in relation to the numbers given? Let me check if there's a way to combine these numbers through multiplication or addition first, since those might lead to larger numbers.\n\nFirst, 350 is a big number. Maybe subtract or add something to it. Let's see, 350 multiplied by something. If I do 350 * 2, that's 700. But 700 is more than 640. Alternatively, 350 * 1.8 would be 630. Wait, but how do I get 1.8 from the other numbers? 18 divided by 10, but I don't have a 10. Alternatively, 12 and 18. 18 / 12 is 1.5. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I should look at 74. If I subtract 74 from 350, that's 350 -74 = 276. That's not helpful. If I add 74 to 350, that's 424. Still not 640. Maybe multiply 74 by something. 74 * 9 is 666, which is close. But where would I get 9? 18 / 2 is 9. But 12 divided by something? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of 640 as 64*10. But 64 isn't directly there. Or 640 is 600 + 40. Maybe 350 + 74 = 424, which isn't enough. Wait, 350 + 74* something. Let's see 350 + (74*4) = 350 + 296 = 646. Close. How to get 4? 12 - 18? No. 12 / 3? But 3 isn't available. Wait, maybe 18 -12=6. Then 74*6=444. 350 + 444=794. Not helpful.\n\nAnother angle: 350 * 2 =700. 700 -60=640. How to get 60? 74 - (12 +18)=74-30=44. Not 60. Alternatively, 12*5=60. Where's 5 from? 74 - (18 + something). Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe 74 * 12 = 888. Then 888 - something. 888 - 248=640. How to get 248? 350 -18=332. Not 248. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, 350 + (something) =640. So 640 -350=290. Need to make 290 from 74,12,18. Let's see. 74*4=296. Close. 296 -6=290. 6 can come from 18-12=6. So 74*4 - (18-12)=296-6=290. Then 350 + (74*4 - (18-12))=350 +290=640. But wait, how to get 4? Because the remaining numbers are 74,12,18. Wait, we already used 74, 12, 18. Wait, the original numbers are 350,74,12,18. So in this case, if I do 74*(something using 12 and 18) but need to use all numbers. So perhaps 74*(12 - (18/ something)). Wait, but 18 divided by something. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, 12 and 18 can be combined. Let's see, 18 -12=6. Then 74*6=444. Then 350 +444=794. Not helpful. Or 12 +18=30. 74*30=2220. That's way too big.\n\nWait, maybe (350 -74) * something. 350-74=276. 276 * (12 /18)=276*(2/3)=184. Not 640.\n\nAlternatively, 350 +74=424. Then 424 * (18/12). 18/12=1.5. 424*1.5=636. Close to 640. But 636 is 4 less. Hmm. Maybe 424 * (18/12) + something. But we've already used all numbers except maybe how? Wait, 424*1.5 is using 350,74,12,18. Wait, 12 and 18 are used in the 18/12 part. So that would use all numbers. But 424*(18/12) =636. Then 636 is 4 less than 640. So maybe that's not possible. Alternatively, if there's a way to adjust.\n\nWait, maybe another approach. Let's think of 640 divided by 350 is roughly 1.828. So maybe 350*(something) =640. So 640/350 ≈1.828. How to make 1.828 with the remaining numbers 74,12,18. Not sure. Maybe 74/(12+18)=74/40=1.85. Close. Then 350*(74/(12+18))=350*(74/40)=350*1.85=647.5. That's 647.5, which is 7.5 over. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, 350*(18/(74-12))=350*(18/62)=350*(9/31)≈350*0.2903≈101.6. Not helpful.\n\nWhat if I subtract something from 350* something. For example, 350*2 - (74 + something). Wait, 350*2=700. 700 - (74 + ...). Let's see. 700 -74=626. Then 626 - (12+18)=626-30=596. Not 640. Alternatively, 700 - (74 - something). 74 - (12+18)=74-30=44. 700 -44=656. Not 640.\n\nHmm. Maybe division. 350 / something. 350 divided by (something) to get part of the equation. For example, 350/(12/18)=350/(2/3)=525. Then 525 +74=599. No. Or 350/(18-12)=350/6≈58.333. 58.333 +74=132.333. Not useful.\n\nWait, maybe multiplication and subtraction. Let's think of 74*12=888. Then 888 - something. 888 - 350=538. Then 538 +18=556. Not 640. Alternatively, 888 - (350 -18)=888-332=556. Same. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, 74*18=1332. Then 1332 -350=982. 982 -12=970. Not helpful.\n\nWhat if we combine 12 and 18 first. Let's see. 12*18=216. Then 216 +74=290. 350 +290=640. Oh! Wait, that works. Let me check: 12*18=216. 216 +74=290. Then 350 +290=640. So the equation would be 350 + (12*18 +74) = 640. Let's verify: 12*18=216. 216+74=290. 350+290=640. Yes! But wait, do all the numbers get used exactly once? 350, 12, 18, 74. Yes. So the equation is 350 + 74 + 12*18. But wait, 12*18 is 216, then 350 +74 is 424, and 424 +216=640. Wait, but that's using addition of 350 and 74, and multiplication of 12 and 18. So the equation would be 350 +74 + (12*18). Let's check the operations: 12*18 is first, then adding 350 and 74. But since addition is associative, it can be written as (350 +74) + (12*18) =424 +216=640. Alternatively, 350 + (74 + (12*18)) which is also the same. But the problem is to use all numbers once, and each number once. Yes, because 350,74,12,18 are all used once. So the equation is 350 +74 +12*18=640. So the equation would be (350 + 74) + (12 * 18) = 640, but since order of operations allows that multiplication is done first, maybe parentheses aren't needed. But perhaps to make it explicit, the equation is 350 +74 +12*18=640. Let me confirm: 12*18=216, 350+74=424, 424+216=640. Yes. That works. So the answer is 350 +74 +12*18. But let's check if there are other possibilities. For example, maybe using subtraction or division. But this seems straightforward. Let me make sure there's no other combination. What if, for example, 350 + (74 - (18/12))? Let's calculate: 18/12=1.5. 74-1.5=72.5. 350+72.5=422.5. Not 640. Another way: 350*(74 - (18-12))=350*(74-6)=350*68=23800. Way too big. Alternatively, 350* (74/(18-12))=350*(74/6)=350*12.333…≈4316.666. Not helpful.\n\nSo the solution seems to be 350 +74 +12*18. Let me check again: 12*18=216, 350+74=424, 424+216=640. Perfect. All numbers used once, only basic operations. So that's the equation.\n</think>\n\n<answer>350 + 74 + 12 * 18</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using the numbers 15, 49, 8, and 45, each exactly once, with basic operations, and the result should be 539. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I'll think about the target number, 539. Let me check what 539 divided by some of these numbers gives. For example, 539 divided by 15 is about 35.93, which isn't an integer. 539 divided by 49 is 11. That's interesting because 49 times 11 is 539. Wait, but 11 isn't one of the numbers I have. So maybe I can use the other numbers to make 11. Let's see: 15, 8, 45. How can I get 11 from those? 15 minus 8 is 7, 45 divided by something... Maybe 45 divided by something else. 45 divided by (15 - 8) would be 45/7 ≈6.428, which isn't helpful. Hmm. Alternatively, 15 - (45/8) is 15 - 5.625 = 9.375, not 11. That doesn't work. Maybe 45 - (15 +8) = 22. Still not 11. So maybe that approach isn't the best.\n\nAnother idea: 539 is close to 540, which is 45*12. So 45*12 -1 =539. But how to get 12 and 1 from the remaining numbers? 49,15,8. Let's see. 15 - (8/ something). Wait, 15 - (8/ something). If I use 49, maybe 49 divided by something. 49/8 is about 6.125. Then 15 - (49/8) is 15 -6.125=8.875. Not helpful. Alternatively, maybe 15 +8=23, 49-23=26. Not sure. Hmm.\n\nWait, let's try another angle. Let's see if combining two numbers first could get closer. For example, 45*15=675. Then 675 - 49=626. That's too high. 626 -8=618. Still too high. Not helpful. How about 49*15=735. Then 735 -45=690. 690-8=682. Still way off.\n\nAlternatively, 49*11=539, so maybe use 49 as a multiplier. So 49*(something) where the something is 11. Then how to make 11 with 15,8,45. Let's try again: 15 - (45/ something). If I do 45 divided by 8, that's 5.625. Then 15 -5.625=9.375. Not 11. What if I do (15 +45)/8=60/8=7.5. Still not 11. Hmm. Maybe 45 - (15 +8)=22. 22 divided by 2 is 11, but I don't have a 2. Alternatively, 45/ (15 -8) =45/7≈6.428. Then 6.428 + something. Wait, but I can't use fractions unless they multiply back to integers. Maybe not the right path.\n\nWait, let's try division. 539 divided by 45 is approximately 11.977. Not helpful. 539 divided by 8 is 67.375. 539 divided by 15 is around 35.93. Maybe not helpful.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe using subtraction and multiplication. For example, 45*8=360. Then 360 +49=409. 409 +15=424. Too low. Not helpful. How about 49*8=392. 392+45=437. 437+15=452. Still low. Alternatively, 49*15=735. Then 735 -45=690. 690 -8=682. Still not 539.\n\nWait, perhaps using parentheses to change the order. Let's think: 15 * 45 is 675. 675 - (49 +8)=675 -57=618. Still not 539. 675 -49* something. If I do 675 -49*8=675-392=283. Not helpful. 49*8=392. Then 392 +45=437, plus15=452. Nope.\n\nHmm. Maybe combining 45 and 8 first. 45-8=37. Then 37*15=555. 555 -49=506. Still off. 555 - (49*something). Not helpful.\n\nWait, what if I do 45*15=675. Then 675 - (49*8)=675-392=283. Still not 539. Hmm. Alternatively, 49*15=735. Then 735 - (45*8)=735-360=375. No. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 45* (15 -8)=45*7=315. Then 315 +49=364. Still too low.\n\nWait, maybe divide some numbers. Let's see: 49 divided by something. 49/8=6.125. Then 45*6.125=275.625. 275.625 +15=290.625. No. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 15/8=1.875. Then 45*1.875=84.375. 84.375 +49=133.375. Nope.\n\nWait, what if I use multiplication and addition. Let's see: 45*8=360. Then 360 +49=409. 409*15=6135. Way too big. No. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 49* (45 +8) =49*53=2597. Then 2597 -15=2582. Still way off.\n\nHmm. Maybe I need to think of exponents, but the problem says only basic operations. So no exponents. So stuck with +, -, *, /.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's list all possible ways to combine three numbers first, then apply the fourth. But that might take time. Let's see. Let's try to think of possible combinations:\n\nFirst, 15 and 45: 15*45=675. Then using 49 and 8. 675 - (49*8)=675-392=283. Not 539. 675 -49 -8=618. No. 675 +49 +8=732. No. 675/ (49-8)=675/41≈16.46.

Not helpful.\n\nWhat if I do 49* (15 + 45) =49*60=2940. Then 2940/8=367.5. No.\n\nAlternatively, 45* (15 +8)=45*23=1035. Then 1035 -49=986. No.\n\nHmm. Maybe 45* (49 -15)=45*34=1530. 1530/8=191.25. No. 1530 -8=1522. No.\n\nWait, 49*8=392. Then 392 +45=437. 437 +15=452. No. 392* (45/15)=392*3=1176. No. 392 + (45*15)=392+675=1067. No.\n\nWait, perhaps 15* (49 +45)=15*94=1410. 1410 -8=1402. No. 1410/8=176.25. Not helpful.\n\nHmm. Maybe subtraction and division. Let's see: 45*(49 - (15/8)). Let's compute 15/8=1.875. Then 49-1.875=47.125. 45*47.125=2120.625. No. Too high.\n\nAlternatively, 49*( (45/15) +8 ). 45/15=3. 3+8=11. 49*11=539! Oh! Wait, that's it! Because 45 divided by 15 is 3, then 3 plus 8 is 11, and 49 times 11 is 539. Let me check:\n\n49 * ( (45 / 15) + 8 ) = 49 * (3 + 8) = 49 * 11 = 539.\n\nYes! That works. So the equation is 49 * (45 / 15 + 8). Let me verify all numbers are used once: 49, 45, 15, 8. All used. Yes. So that's the correct equation.\n</think>\n\n<answer>49 * (45 / 15 + 8)</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using the numbers 19, 34, 217, 6, each exactly once, with basic operations to get 225. Hmm. Let me start by considering the target number 225. Breaking it down, 225 is 15 squared, which might not help directly, but maybe factors could. 225 is 25*9, but again, not sure. Let's think about the numbers given.\n\nFirst, look at the larger numbers like 217. If I subtract something from 217, maybe? Let's see: 217 - something. If I subtract, say, 34, that would be 183. Not helpful. If I subtract 19, that's 198. Still not 225. Wait, maybe addition. 217 + 34 = 251, which is over. 217 + 19 = 236. Also over. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, multiplication. Let's see. 34 * 6 is 204. Then adding 19 gives 223, which is close but not 225. If I take 34*6=204, then maybe 217 - (something). Wait, 217 - (34*6) would be 217 - 204=13. Not helpful. \n\nWhat if I use 217 and 6 first. 217 divided by 6 is about 36.16. Not an integer. Maybe 217 - 6 =211. Then 211 +34=245, then minus 19=226. Close. But no. Alternatively, 34*6=204. Then 204 +19=223. Still 2 off. How to get those two more? Maybe not that way.\n\nWait, perhaps 217 - (34 - 19) +6. Let's calculate that: 34-19=15. 217-15=202. 202 +6=208. Not enough. Hmm.\n\nAnother approach: 34 * (6 + something). Let's see. 6 + 19=25. 34*25=850. That's way over. But 34*6=204. Then 204 + something. 204 +217=421. No. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe 217 - (34 / something). Let's see: 34 divided by 6 is about 5.666. 217 -5.666≈211.333. Then adding 19 would be 230.333. Not 225. Maybe not.\n\nWhat if I use division in another way. 217 divided by something. For example, 217 / (34 - 19) = 217 /15 ≈14.466. Then multiply by 6: 14.466*6≈86.8. Not 225. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe 217 - (6*(34/19)). Let's compute 34/19≈1.789. 6*1.789≈10.736. Then 217 -10.736≈206.264. Then adding 19 would be 225.264. Oh, that's very close. But we have to use all numbers exactly once. Wait, in this case, if we do 217 - (6*(34/19)) +19? But 19 is already used as part of the denominator. Wait, no. If we use 34/19, that's using 34 and 19. Then 6*(34/19) uses 6. Then 217 - that result uses 217. Then adding 19 would be using 19 again, which is not allowed. Each number must be used once.\n\nSo that approach doesn't work. Let's think again.\n\nAnother idea: Combine 19 and 34 to make a bigger number. Like 19 +34=53. Then 53* something. 53*4=212. Adding 13 would get to 225. But 217 and 6 left. Maybe 217 -6=211. Then 211 + something. Not helpful.\n\nWait, 217 +6=223. Then 223 +2=225. Where to get the 2? Maybe 34 - (19*2). But we can't use 2. Alternatively, 34 divided by something. 34/17=2, but 17 isn't available. Wait, 34/(19- something). If 34/(19 -6)=34/13≈2.615. 223 +2.615≈225.615. Not exact. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, multiply 34 and 6 to get 204. Then 204 + 21=225. Where to get 21? 217 - (something). 217 -196=21. But how to get 196? 19*10. Not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps 217 - (19 + 6). That's 217 -25=192. Then 192 +34=226. Close. Still 1 over.\n\nHmm. Maybe 217 - (34 - 6) = 217 -28=189. Then 189 +19=208. No.\n\nWait, what if we do (34 - 19) * something. 15 * something. 15*15=225. How to get 15 from other numbers. Wait, 217 and 6. 217 -6=211. Not helpful. 217 /6≈36.16. No. Alternatively, 6* something. Maybe 6*(34-19)=6*15=90. Then 217 -90=127. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 217 - (34 + 19) = 217 -53=164. Then 164 +6=170. No.\n\nHmm, maybe a different approach. Let's list possible combinations.\n\nWe have to use all four numbers: 19, 34, 217, 6. So the equation must have all of them. Let's think of possible operations. Maybe a combination of multiplication and addition.\n\nWait, 217 + 34 = 251. Then subtract something. 251 - (19 +6)=251 -25=226. Still 1 over. Close.\n\nWait, 251 - (19*6). 19*6=114. 251-114=137. No. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 34*6=204. Then 204 +217=421. Minus 19=402. No.\n\nWait, 217 + (34 - 19) +6. Let's compute: 34-19=15. 217+15=232. 232+6=238. No.\n\nAnother angle: 217 divided by something. Let's say 217/(6) ≈36.16. Then multiply by 34: 36.16*34=1229.44. Then subtract 19? Way too high. Not helpful.\n\nHow about 19*6=114. Then 34*6=204. Wait, but we can't reuse 6. So if I use 19*6=114. Then 34* something. 34*(217 -114)=34*103=3502. No. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe (217 - 19) * (34 /6). Let's compute: 217-19=198. 34/6≈5.666. 198*5.666≈1121. Not 225.\n\nAlternatively, (34 - 6) * (217 -19). 28 * 198=5544. Way too big.\n\nHmm. Maybe using subtraction and addition. Let's think: 217 +34=251. Then subtract 26. 251-26=225. Where to get 26 from? 19 +6=25. Hmm, close but not 26. Wait, 19 + (34/ something). 34 divided by 2 is 17, but 2 is not available. 34/6≈5.666. 19 +5.666≈24.666. So 251 -24.666≈226.333. Not exact.\n\nAlternatively, 217 + (6* something). 6*34=204. 217+204=421. Then subtract 19=402. No.\n\nWait, maybe 34*(19 -6). 19-6=13. 34*13=442. Then subtract 217=442-217=225. Wait, that works! Let's check:\n\n34*(19 -6) -217 = 34*13 -217 = 442 -217=225. Yes! But let's verify if all numbers are used exactly once: 34 is used, 19 and 6 are used in (19-6), and 217 is subtracted. So all four numbers are used once. So the equation would be 34*(19 -6) -217 =225.\n\nLet me check the arithmetic again: 19-6=13. 34*13=442. 442-217=225. Exactly. Yes! That works.\n</think>\n\n<answer>34 * (19 - 6) - 217 = 225</answer>"}]}

All numbers must be used once, and I can only use basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division. Hmm. Let's start by thinking about how these numbers can combine.\n\nFirst, maybe look for larger numbers. 83 and 47 are both in the 40s and 80s. If I add them together, 83 + 47 is 130. Then what's left is 7 and 40. Maybe 130 plus something with 7 and 40. Let me try: 130 + (40 - 7) = 130 + 33 = 163. That's not enough. If I multiply 40 and 7, that's 280. Then 130 + 280 is 410, which is way over. Alternatively, maybe subtract. 83 + 47 - 40 -7 = 83 +47 is 130, minus 47 (wait, 40 and 7) 130 - 40=90, -7=83. No, that's not helpful.\n\nWhat if I multiply some numbers. Let's see. 83 * 3 = 249, which is close to 244, but how to get 3 from the remaining numbers. But I have 7,40,47. Wait, but maybe not. Alternatively, 47 * 5 is 235, and then add 9. But not sure. Let's try different combinations.\n\nAnother approach: target 244. Let's think about possible operations. 244 divided by something. But maybe working backwards. Suppose the equation is a combination like (something) * (something else) = 244. Let's see. 244 factors: 244 divided by 2 is 122, divided by 4 is 61. So factors are 4 and 61, or 2 and 122. Maybe 83 - 47 = 36. Then 36 * 7=252. 252 - 40=212. Not 244. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, 47 -7 =40. Then 40 is already in the list. Wait, but we can't reuse numbers. So maybe 47 -7=40, but 40 is already present, so that would be using 47,7,40, which are all needed, but we can't create 40 from others if we have to use all numbers. So that's not allowed.\n\nWait, another idea: 83 * 3 =249, then subtract 5. But how to get 3 and 5. Alternatively, 83 * (40 / (7 + something)). Let me think. 40 divided by something. If 40 divided by (47 -7) is 40/40=1, then 83*1=83. Not helpful. Hmm.\n\nWait, what if we subtract 47 from 83. 83-47=36. Then 36 *7=252. Then 252 - (40) =212. No, not enough. Alternatively, 36 +7=43, 43*40=1720, that's way too big.\n\nAlternatively, 83 +47=130. Then 7*40=280. 280 -130=150. Not 244. Not enough. Wait, 130 + 280 is 410, as before.\n\nWhat if I multiply 83 and 40? 83*40=3320. That's way too big. Maybe divide. 83* (40 - (47-7)). Let's see: 47-7=40. Then 40-40=0. So 83*0=0. No.\n\nAlternatively, (83 + 47) * something. 83+47=130. 130 * 2 =260. How to get 2 from 7 and 40. 40/ (7 + something). Wait, 40 divided by 20 is 2. But how to get 20. 7 +13=20. But 13 is not a number here. Hmm. Alternatively, 40 - (7* something). 7*5=35, 40-35=5. Not 2. Not helpful.\n\nAnother angle: 7 is a small number, maybe use division. Let's see. 47 + 7=54. 83 -54=29. Then 29 *40=1160. No. Not helpful.\n\nWhat if I do 83 * 7=581. Then 581 -47=534. 534 -40=494. No. Not 244.\n\nWait, 40*7=280. 280 -47=233. 233 +83=316. No. 316- something? Wait, all numbers must be used once. So I can't reuse 83 here. Hmm.\n\nAnother approach: Let's see 244 is close to 240, which is 40*6. So 40*(6.1) =244. But how to get 6.1 using 83,47,7. Let's see. Maybe 47 - (83/7). 83 divided by 7 is approx 11.857. 47 -11.857≈35.143. Multiply by 40: 1405.7. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, (83 - (47 +7)) * something. 83-54=29. 29 *40=1160. No.\n\nWait, perhaps combining multiplication and addition. Let's see: 47*7=329. 329 -83=246. Close to 244. 246 -40=206. Not enough. Alternatively, 329 - (83 +40)=329 -123=206. Still not. Hmm.\n\nWait, 7*40=280. Then 280 -47=233. Then 233 +83=316. Not 244. Alternatively, 280 +83=363. 363 -47=316. Still no.\n\nHmm. Maybe using division. Let's try 83 divided by something. 83 / (7 - (47-40)). Let's compute the denominator: 47-40=7. Then 7-7=0. Division by zero. Not allowed.\n\nAlternatively, (83 + 47) / (40 -7). 130 /33≈3.939. Then multiply by something. But no other numbers left. We have to use all numbers, so each number must be used once. So each of 83,47,7,40 must be in the equation once.\n\nMaybe use parentheses to combine operations. Let's try 83 * (40 - (47 -7)). Let's compute inside: 47-7=40. Then 40-40=0. So 83*0=0. Not helpful.\n\nWait, another way: 47 -7=40. But then we already have 40. So maybe replace 40 with (47-7). But since we must use all numbers, we can't replace 40. So that's not allowed. Because we have to use 40 as is.\n\nWait, perhaps combine 83 and 7. 83-7=76. Then 76 * (47-40)=76*7=532. 532. Not 244. Alternatively, 83 +7=90. 90 * (47-40)=90*7=630. No.\n\nHmm. What if I do 47 * (7 + 40). Let's see: 7+40=47. So 47*47=2209. Then subtract 83? 2209-83=2126. Way too big. No.\n\nAlternatively, 47*7=329. 329 +83=412. 412 -40=372. Still no.\n\nWait, let's think about 244. 244 is 4*61. Or 2*122. Maybe 61*4. How to get 61 and 4 from the numbers. 83 - 47=36. 36 + (40/ (something)). Wait, 40 divided by 10 is 4. How to get 10. 7 +3=10. But 3 is not here. Alternatively, 47-40=7. Then 40/7 is approximately 5.7. Not 4. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, 40 divided by (7 - (47- something)). Wait, maybe a different approach. Let me list possible combinations with each operation.\n\nPossible pairs:\n\n83 and 47: can add, subtract, multiply, divide.\n\n83 +47=130\n\n83-47=36\n\n83*47=3901 (too big)\n\n83/47≈1.765\n\nSimilarly, 83 and 7:\n\n83+7=90\n\n83-7=76\n\n83*7=581\n\n83/7≈11.857\n\n83 and40:\n\n83+40=123\n\n83-40=43\n\n83*40=3320\n\n83/40=2.075\n\n47 and7:\n\n47+7=54\n\n47-7=40 (but 40 is already a number, can't replace)\n\n47*7=329\n\n47/7≈6.714\n\n47 and40:\n\n47+40=87\n\n47-40=7 (again, 7 is already present)\n\n47*40=1880\n\n47/40=1.175\n\n7 and40:\n\n7+40=47 (again, 47 is present)\n\n7*40=280\n\n7/40=0.175\n\nSo, perhaps using subtraction where 47-7=40 is not allowed because it would duplicate 40, which is already present. So we have to avoid that.\n\nSo maybe look for combinations that use each number once. Let's see:\n\nIf we take 83 * (7 +40) =83*47=3901, but that's way over. Alternatively, 83*(40 -7)=83*33=2739. No.\n\nAlternatively, 47* (83 -40)=47*43=2021. Not helpful.\n\nHmm. What if we do 83 + 47 +40 +7= 177. Not 244. Not enough.\n\nWait, maybe using division to reduce numbers. For example, 83 divided by something. Let's see: 83 / (47 -40) =83/7≈11.857. Then 11.857 * (7 +40). Wait, but we already used 47,40,7. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, (83 * 7) - (47 * (40 / something)). Wait, this is getting complicated. Let's think step by step.\n\nWait, 244 is 40*6.1. How to get 6.1. 47 - (83/ (7 + something)). Hmm. Maybe 40 is involved in division. Let me try.\n\nWait, (47 +7) * (40 - (83 / something)). Not sure. Let me plug in numbers. 47+7=54. 40 - (83/x). Let x be one of the remaining numbers. Wait, but all numbers must be used. So if I use 83,47,7,40 in the equation, perhaps as:\n\nLet me try 83 * 3 + 40. 3*83=249, 249-5=244. How to get 5? 47 - (7*6)=47-42=5. But then where to get 6. Not possible. Alternatively, 47-7=40. Then 40- (something). But again, can't reuse 40.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 83 + 47 + (7 * 40). Let's calculate that: 83+47=130, 7*40=280, total 410. Too big.\n\nWait, 7*40=280. 280 -83=197. 197+47=244. Oh! Wait, that uses all numbers: 7*40=280, then 280 -83=197, then 197+47=244. Let's check: 7 *40 =280; 280 -83=197; 197 +47=244. Yes! All numbers used once: 7,40,83,47. Operations used: *, -, +. So the equation is 7*40 -83 +47=244. Let's verify:\n\n7*40=280\n\n280-83=197\n\n197+47=244. Yes!\n\nSo the equation is ((7 * 40) -83) +47 =244. Alternatively, written as 7*40 -83 +47=244. Since multiplication comes first, the parentheses might not be necessary, but to make it clear, maybe (7 *40) -83 +47.\n</think>\n\n<answer>7 * 40 - 83 + 47 = 244</answer>"}]}

Let's start by thinking about possible combinations.\n\nFirst, 154 is a bit more than 132, so maybe 132 plus something? Let's see. If I use 132, then the remaining numbers are 65, 84, and 41. What can I do with those? Let's add 65 and 84: 65 + 84 = 149. Then 149 plus 41 is 190, which is too much. If I subtract instead, maybe 84 - 65 = 19, then 19 + 41 = 60. Then 132 + 60 = 192. Still not 154. Alternatively, maybe multiply. Let's see, 84 divided by 41 is about 2.048... Hmm, not sure. What if I do 84 - 41 = 43, then 65 + 43 = 108. 132 + 108 is 240, which is way over. Maybe subtract from 132. Like 132 - (something). Let's try. If I take 132 - (84 - (65 + 41)), but that seems complicated. Let me calculate that: 65 + 41 is 106, then 84 - 106 is -22, so 132 - (-22) = 154. Wait, that might work. Let me check again:\n\n65 + 41 = 106. Then 84 - 106 = -22. Then 132 - (-22) equals 132 + 22 = 154. But I used all numbers: 65, 41, 84, 132. So the equation would be 132 - (84 - (65 + 41)) = 154. Let me write that out with proper parentheses: 132 - (84 - 65 - 41). Wait, no. Wait, 84 minus (65 + 41) is 84 - 106 = -22. So 132 - (-22) = 154. So the equation would be 132 - (84 - (65 + 41)) = 154.

It's a bit less than 700, which is part of the numbers here. 702 is one of the numbers, so maybe I can subtract something from 702 to get 677. Let's check: 702 minus 25 is 677. But do I have 25? Well, I have 35 and 22 and 12. Maybe I can combine them to make 25. Let's see. 35 minus 12 is 23, which is close. 35 minus 22 is 13. 22 minus 12 is 10. Not 25. Alternatively, 12 + 22 = 34. 35 - 34 = 1. Not helpful. Wait, maybe I can add 35 and 22 to get 57. Then 702 minus 57 is 645. That's not 677. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe multiply some numbers. Let's see. 35 times 22 is 770. If I subtract 12 from that, 770 -12 =758, then subtract 702? 758 -702=56. No. Not helpful. What about 35 times 12 is 420. Then 420 + 22=442. 702 -442=260. No. \n\nWait, 702 divided by something. 702 divided by 12 is 58.5. If I subtract 35 and 22, but I can only use each once. Let's see. Maybe 702 / 12 = 58.5. Then 58.5 plus 35 is 93.5. Not helpful. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, 35 times 22 is 770. Then 770 - 702 =68. Then 68 -12=56. Still not.\n\nWait, maybe combining addition and subtraction. Let's see. 702 - 35 = 667. Then 667 + 12 = 679.

Then minus 12 (used) gives 677. So that's 702 -35 +22 -12 =677. But let's make sure the order of operations is correct. Since subtraction and addition are left to right, yes.

All of them must be used exactly once, and the result should be 1. Let's see. Hmm. Basic operations are allowed: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division. \n\nFirst, maybe I should think about how combining these numbers can get close to 1. Since 1 is a small number, perhaps division or subtraction could be useful here. Let me list out the numbers again: 523, 702, 88, 92.\n\nOne approach is to pair them into two groups, where one group divided by the other gives 1. That would mean the numerator and denominator are equal. But since all numbers must be used, maybe combining them through operations to make two equal expressions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using subtraction where two larger numbers are subtracted, and then divided by another pair. Let's try some combinations.\n\nLooking at 702 and 523. 702 minus 523 is 179. Then 88 and 92. Let's add them: 88 + 92 = 180. So 179 is almost 180. Hmm. So 702 - 523 = 179. Then 88 + 92 = 180. If I subtract 1 from 180, maybe? Wait, but how. Maybe (702 - 523) / (88 + 92 -1). But I can't use numbers more than once. So that idea might not work.\n\nWait, perhaps (702 - 523) / (88 + 92) = 179 / 180 ≈ 0.994... Close to 1, but not exactly. Maybe there's a way to get exactly 1.\n\nAnother idea: use multiplication and division. For example, if I can have (a * b) / (c * d) = 1, then a*b must equal c*d. Let's check possible products.\n\nLooking at 702 * 88 = 61776. Then 523 * 92 = 48116. Not equal. Hmm. 702 * 92 = 64584. 523 * 88 = 46024. Still not equal. 702 * 523 is a huge number, and 88*92 is 8096. Not helpful.\n\nMaybe subtraction and division. Let's try (702 - 523) - (92 - 88). That would be 179 - 4 = 175. Not 1. How about (702 / 523) - (92 / 88)? Let's calculate 702 divided by 523 is approximately 1.342. 92 divided by 88 is approximately 1.045. Subtracting gives about 0.297. Not 1.\n\nWait, maybe (702 / 523) - (92 - 88). That's 1.342 - 4 = -2.658. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 702 / (523 + 88 + 92). Let's see: 523 + 88 = 611, plus 92 is 703. So 702 / 703 ≈ 0.998. Close, but not 1.\n\nHmm. What if I use subtraction and division. For example, (702 - (523 + 88 + 92)). Let's compute 523 +88 is 611, +92 is 703. So 702 -703 = -1. But that's -1. Not 1. But if I take absolute value, but I can't add operations beyond +, -, *, /. So maybe if I reverse the subtraction: (523 +88 +92) -702 = 703 -702 =1. But wait, that uses all numbers except one. Wait, 523 +88 +92 +702? No, that's using all numbers but adding. But if I do 523 +88 +92 -702 = 703 -702 =1. But then I'm using all four numbers: 523, 88, 92, 702. Wait, let me check: 523 +88 is 611, +92 is 703. Then 703 -702 =1. But that's using 523, 88, 92, and 702. All four numbers. So the equation would be (523 + 88 + 92) - 702 =1. But wait, is that correct? Let's verify:\n\n523 + 88 = 611\n\n611 +92 = 703\n\n703 -702 =1. Yes! So that's using all four numbers once each with operations + and -. So the equation is (523 +88 +92) -702 =1. But wait, the numbers are used once each, and all operations are allowed. So this works. But does the order matter? Let me check. The parentheses group 523 +88 +92 first, then subtract 702. Yes. So that's (523 + 88 + 92) - 702 =1. So maybe that's the equation. Let me confirm. Each number is used once, and all four numbers are used. The operations are addition and subtraction. So that's valid. \n\nWait, but the original problem says \"create an equation that equals 1\". So this seems to fit. Let me check again:\n\n523 +88 = 611\n\n611 +92 = 703\n\n703 -702 =1. Yes, exactly 1. \n\nSo the equation is (523 + 88 + 92) - 702 =1. So perhaps that's the answer. But let me make sure there's no other way. \n\nAlternatively, using multiplication or division. For example, (702 - 523) / (92 -88) =179 /4 =44.75. Not 1. \n\nOr, (88 - (702 - 523)) * (92). That's 88 -179 = -91, multiplied by 92 is -8372. No. \n\nAnother approach: 702 divided by something. 702 / 523 = ~1.342. If we can get 702 divided by 523 multiplied by something else. But that seems complicated. \n\nAlternatively, 92 -88 =4. Then 523 -4 =519. 702 -519=183. Not 1. \n\nAlternatively, (92 / (702 - 523)) + (88 / 523). Let's see: 702-523=179. 92/179≈0.514. 88/523≈0.168. Sum is ~0.682. Not 1. \n\nAlternatively, (523 - (702 - 92)) /88. Let's compute 702-92=610. 523-610=-87. -87/88≈-0.988. Close to -1 but not 1. \n\nAlternatively, (92 - (702 / 523)) *88. 702/523≈1.342. 92-1.342≈90.658. Multiply by 88≈7978. Not 1. \n\nSo the first approach seems to be the only way. Let me check again. \n\n523 +88 +92 =703. 703 -702=1. So yes, that uses all four numbers once each. The equation would be (523 + 88 + 92) - 702 =1. Which is correct. \n\nBut wait, when combining the three numbers (523,88,92) with addition, is that allowed? The problem states that each number can be used once, and all must be used. So yes, because we are using all four numbers: 523,88,92 in the sum, and 702 subtracted. \n\nTherefore, the equation is valid. So the answer is (523 + 88 + 92) - 702 =1.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(523 + 88 + 92) - 702 = 1</answer>"}]}

Let's see. 18 divided by something? 18 divided by (8 - something). Wait, 18 divided by (18/8) is 8, but that might not help. Alternatively, maybe 18 - 8 = 10, but that's not 7. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use multiplication. 8 times something plus or minus. Let's see, 18 divided by 18 is 1. Then 36 - 8 + 1 = 29. Wait, that might work. Let me check. If I do 36 - 8 + (18/18), that would be 36 - 8 is 28, plus 1 is 29. But does that use all the numbers? Let's see: 36, 8, 18, 18. Yes, because one 18 is used in the division (18/18), and the other 18 is... Wait, no. Wait, 18 divided by 18 uses one 18 each. So that would use both 18s. Then 36 -8 uses 36 and 8. So all four numbers are used. Wait, yes! 36 -8 + (18/18). Let me calculate that: 36 -8 is 28, then 18/18 is 1, so 28 +1 is 29. That works! So the equation would be 36 - 8 + (18 / 18) = 29.

Hmm, 952 is a pretty big number, so probably multiplication is going to be involved here. Let me start by thinking about how these numbers can combine through multiplication to reach a high value.\n\nFirst, let's look at the largest numbers: 34 and 35. Multiplying them together gives 34*35 = 1190. That's already over 952, so maybe if I subtract something from that product. But 1190 minus what's left? The remaining numbers are 15 and 12. 1190 - 15 - 12 = 1163, which is still too high. That's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe 1190 divided by something? 1190 divided by 15 is around 79.3, which multiplied by 12 would be 952? Let's check: 1190/15 = 79.333..., then 79.333... *12 = 952. Oh, wait, that actually works out. Let me verify that calculation properly.\n\nWait, 34 * 35 = 1190. Then 1190 divided by 15 is 79.333..., and 79.333... multiplied by 12 is indeed 952. But how do I arrange the equation here? Because I need to use all four numbers, each once. So maybe (34 * 35 / 15) * 12. Let's check that step by step. 34 multiplied by 35 is 1190. Divided by 15 gives 1190/15 = 79.333... (which is 79 and 1/3). Multiply by 12: 79.333... * 12 = 952. Yes, that works. So the equation would be (34 * 35 / 15) * 12. Let me confirm the order of operations here. Multiplication and division have the same precedence, so left to right. So first 34*35=1190, then divided by 15 gives approximately 79.333, then multiplied by 12 gives exactly 952. Let me check with a calculator: 34*35=1190. 1190 divided by 15 is 79.3333333... Multiply that by 12: 79.3333333... *12 = 952. Exactly. So that works. And all numbers are used once: 34,35,15,12. So the equation is (34 × 35 ÷ 15) ×12 = 952. So I need to write that in the answer tags. Wait, but parentheses might need to be adjusted. Let me make sure the order is correct. If I write it as (34 * 35 / 15) * 12, that's correct. Alternatively, maybe without the parentheses between 34*35/15, but since multiplication and division are left to right, but to make sure the division by 15 happens after the multiplication, the parentheses clarify that. So yes, that should be the equation.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(34 * 35 / 15) * 12 = 952</answer>"}]}

I need to use all of them with +, -, *, /, each operation possibly used multiple times. But each number can be used only once. So I have to find a way to combine these four numbers into 880.\n\nLet me start by considering the largest number, which is 849.

Then I have 78 and 92 left. Hmm. How can I make 14 with 78 and 92? Wait, 92 minus 78 is 14. So putting that together: 849 + 17 + (92 - 78). Let me check that: 849 +17 is 866. Then 92 -78 is 14. 866 +14 is 880. Oh! That works! Let me verify each step:\n\n849 +17 = 866. Then 92 -78 =14. Then 866 +14=880. Yes! All numbers are used once: 17,78,92,849. Operations used are +, -, +. So the equation would be 849 +17 +92 -78 =880. Let me check the order. If I group them as (849 +17) + (92 -78) that equals 866 +14 =880. So yes. So the equation is (849 + 17) + (92 - 78) =880. But since addition and subtraction are left-associative, I can write it as 849 +17 +92 -78 =880. Either way, as long as the operations are correct. Let me check if parentheses are needed. Without parentheses, it's 849+17=866, then 866+92=958, then 958-78=880. Wait, that's correct. So actually, the equation could be written as 849 +17 +92 -78 =880. Because adding 17, 92, and subtracting 78.

Wait, but I can't reuse numbers. Alternatively, maybe 58 - 11 = 47. Then 47 minus something... But I need to use all numbers. Alternatively, maybe multiply or divide.\n\nWait, let's try another approach. Let's look for combinations where one operation can get close. For example, 58 and 5. 58 divided by 5 is 11.6, which is close to 11. But not exactly. Alternatively, 58 minus 5 is 53. Then 53 minus 23 is 30. Then 30 minus 11 is 19.

Let's see: 58 - (something) = 29. So the something would need to be 29. How to make 29 from the remaining numbers 23, 5, 11. Hmm. Let's see. 23 + 5 + 11 = 39. That's too much. 23 + (5 * something). 5 * 11 = 55, plus 23 is 78. No. Alternatively, 23 - 5 + 11 = 29. Wait, 23 -5 is 18, plus 11 is 29. Oh! So if I have 58 - (23 -5 +11) = 58 -29 =29? Wait, but that uses all numbers except how? Let me check: 23,5,11 are used in the (23 -5 +11) part, which is 29. Then subtract that from 58. So 58 - (23 -5 +11) =58 -29=29. Yes!

Let me start by listing out the numbers I have: two 69s, a 2, and a 36. All of them need to be used.\n\nFirst thought: 72 is a number close to 69. Maybe I can adjust 69 by adding or subtracting something. For example, 69 + 3 is 72. But where would I get the 3? Wait, there's a 2 and a 36. If I can get 3 from 36 and 2 somehow. Let's see: 36 divided by 12 is 3. But how do I get 12 from the remaining numbers? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe 36 divided by 2 is 18. So 69 + 18 would be 87, which is too big. That's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe subtract something from 69. 69 - (something) = 72. Wait, that would require a negative number, which might not be straightforward.

Let's think: 36 divided by (something) equals a number that when combined with others gives 72. Like 36 divided by 2 is 18. Then 69 - 18 is 51. But how to use the other 69? 51 plus 69 is 120. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 69 minus 36 is 33. Then 33 times 2 is 66. Plus the other 69 is 135. Nope.\n\nHmm. Maybe using parentheses in a different way. Let me think of 72 as 36 times 2. But we already have 36 and 2. If I could use them together, but then how do the 69s come into play? 36*2=72, but I have to use both 69s. That's a problem because if I do 36*2=72, then the 69s are left unused. So that approach doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (69 - 69) + 36 * 2. But 69-69 is zero, plus 72 equals 72. Wait, but that uses 69, 69, 36, 2. All numbers. Let's check: (69 - 69) + (36 * 2) = 0 + 72 = 72. Yes! That works. But wait, the problem states that each number can be used only once. But there are two 69s. Wait, the original problem says \"using the numbers 69, 2, 69, 36\". So there are two 69s provided, and each can be used once. So in this case, using both 69s once each is allowed. So (69 - 69) + 36 * 2. That uses all numbers: two 69s, 36, 2. Each once. And operations are subtraction, addition, and multiplication. So this equation equals 72. Let me verify: 69-69=0, 36*2=72, 0+72=72. Correct. So that's a possible solution.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"create an equation that equals 72\" using each number once. The two 69s are allowed since they are given. So this works. Let me see if there are other possibilities. Another way: (69 + 69) - (36 / 2). Let's calculate that. 69+69=138, 36/2=18, 138-18=120. No. Not 72. Alternatively, (69 * 2) - (69 - 36). Let's check: 138 - 33 = 105. Not 72. How about (69 - (36 / 2)) + 69. 36/2=18, 69-18=51, 51+69=120. No. Not helpful.\n\nAnother idea: 36 + 36 =72. But we don't have two 36s. But maybe 69 - something =72. Wait, that's not possible unless the something is negative. Alternatively, maybe (69 / something) * something else. Let's try 69 divided by (something) times another number. For example, 69 divided by 2 is 34.5, times 36 is 1242. Way too big. Not useful.\n\nAlternatively, 69 divided by (36 / 2) = 69 / 18 ≈3.833. Not helpful. Maybe adding that to the other 69: 69 + 3.833≈72.833. Close but not exact. And we need exact 72.\n\nAlternatively, 36 * 2 =72, and then 69 - 69 =0. So combining them as 36*2 + (69 -69) =72. Which is the same as the first solution I thought of. So that's valid.\n\nSo the equation is (69 - 69) + 36 * 2 =72. Alternatively written as 36*2 + (69 -69) =72.\n\nI think this is the correct equation. Let me check once more:\n\n- 36 multiplied by 2 is 72.\n\n- 69 minus 69 is 0.\n\n- Adding them together: 72 + 0 =72.\n\nSo yes, that works. All numbers are used once each (including both 69s), and the operations are multiplication, subtraction, and addition. So this should be the answer.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(36 * 2) + (69 - 69) = 72</answer>"}]}

Hmm. Let me start by thinking about factors of 144. 144 is 12 squared, so maybe I can find combinations that multiply to 12 and then square them? Wait, but the numbers I have don't include 12. Alternatively, 144 is 24 multiplied by 6. Let's check that: 24 * 6 is 144. Oh, that's interesting. So if I can use 24 and 6, that gives me 144. But then I still have 78 and 7 left. Wait, the problem says I have to use all numbers. So maybe I need to somehow involve 78 and 7 in the equation to get to 144.\n\nAlternatively, maybe combining the other numbers in such a way that when multiplied or divided by 24 and 6, it results in 144. Let me think. Let's see, 78 divided by something... 78 divided by (7 - 6) would be 78 / 1 = 78. Then 78 multiplied by something else? If I do 78 divided by (7 - 6) * 24, that's 78 * 24 = 1872, which is way too big. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe 78 minus 24 is 54, but that's not helpful. 78 minus 7 is 71, and 71 times 6 is 426. Not close. Hmm. Let me try other combinations. 7 and 6 can be combined as 7*6=42, but then 78-42=36. Then 36*24=864. Still not 144. Alternatively, 78 divided by 7 is approximately 11.14, which when multiplied by 24 gives around 267. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe using subtraction or addition. Let's see, 24 is a good number here. If I can get 144 by multiplying 24 by 6, but then I have 78 and 7 left. How can I use them? Since I need to use all numbers, perhaps there's a way to combine them with division or subtraction. For example, maybe (78 - 7) * something. 78-7 is 71. 71 multiplied by 2 is 142, not 144. But 71 multiplied by (24/6) would be 71 *4 = 284. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 78 divided by 6 is 13. Then 13 plus 7 is 20. Then 20 multiplied by 24 is 480. Still not. Wait, 78 divided by 6 is 13. Then 24 divided by (13 -7)? Wait, 13-7=6. So 24/6=4. Then 4*78=312. No. Hmm.\n\nWhat if I use parentheses to group operations. Let's try combinations. Let's see, 78 and 7. 78 minus 7 is 71. Then 71 multiplied by something. But 71*2=142. Close to 144 but not quite. But where would the 2 come from? Maybe 24 divided by 12? Wait, but we don't have 12. Alternatively, 6 divided by 3, but we don't have 3. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to use division in a way that cancels out some parts. For example, (78 * 24) divided by something. Let's calculate 78*24=1872. Then 1872 divided by (7*6) is 1872/42=44.571... Not 144. Alternatively, 78*24 divided by (7+6) is 1872/13=144. Oh! Wait, that's 144. Let me check that. 78 multiplied by 24 is 1872. 7 plus 6 is 13. Then 1872 divided by 13 equals 144. Yes! Because 13*144=1872. So the equation would be (78 * 24) / (7 + 6) = 144. Let's verify all numbers: 78, 24, 7, 6. Each is used once. The operations are *, +, and the division. That works! So the equation is (78 * 24) divided by (7 + 6). Let me write that as (78 * 24)/(7 + 6) = 144.

I need to create an equation using the numbers 11, 29, 4, and 77 exactly once each, with basic arithmetic operations, to get 57. Hmm. Let me start by thinking about possible combinations.\n\nFirst, 57 is the target. Let me look at the numbers given. 77 is the largest, so maybe subtracting something from 77 could get close. 77 minus what? If I take 77 - 29, that's 48. Then maybe add or subtract the other numbers. 48 + 11 would be 59, which is too high. 48 + 4 is 52. Not quite. Alternatively, 77 - 11 is 66. Then subtract 29 and 4? Wait, but I can only use each number once. So maybe 77 - (29 + 4) = 77 - 33 = 44. Then add 11? 44 +11=55. Close, but not 57. Hmm.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe multiplication or division. Let's see. 29 and 4 could be combined. 29 * 4 is 116, which might be too big. 29 /4 is about 7.25. Not sure. 11 and 4: 11*4=44. Then 77 - 44=33. Then add 29? 33+29=62. Not 57. Alternatively, 77 divided by something. 77 divided by 4 is 19.25. Then maybe 29 - (77/4) +11? Let's calculate: 29 - 19.25 = 9.75, plus 11 is 20.75. Nope.\n\nWait, maybe I need to use subtraction and division together. Let's see: 29 + (77 - 11)/4. Let's check: 77-11=66, 66/4=16.5, then 29 +16.5=45.5. Not 57.\n\nAlternatively, 77 - 29 =48. Then 48 + (11 -4)=48+7=55. Still 2 short. Hmm.\n\nWhat if I multiply 11 and 4 to get 44, then 77 -44=33, then 33 +29=62. Not helpful. Wait, 77 - (11*4)=77-44=33. Then 29 +33=62. Still no.\n\nWait, maybe combining 29 and 11. 29 +11=40. Then 77-40=37. Then 37 +4=41. Not helpful. Or 29 -11=18. Then 77 -18=59, plus 4 is 63. No.\n\nAlternatively, 29 multiplied by something. 29*2=58, which is close. But how to get 2 from the remaining numbers. The remaining numbers are 11,4,77. If I do 77 divided by (11 +4), that's 77/15≈5.133. Not 2. Hmm. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe 29 + (77 / (11 -4)). Let's see: 11-4=7, 77/7=11. Then 29+11=40. Not 57.\n\nAlternatively, (77 - 29) * (4 -11). Wait, 77-29=48, 4-11=-7. 48*(-7)= -336. Not helpful.\n\nHmm. Let's try a different angle. 57 is 3*19. But not sure how to get that with these numbers. Maybe 57 is 60-3. Let's see. 60 can be 11*4 + something. 11*4=44, plus 16. But 16 isn't available. Alternatively, 29 + 77=106. Then 106 minus something. 106 - (11*4)=106-44=62. Then 62-5=57, but I don't have a 5. Alternatively, 106 - (4* something). Maybe 4*12.25=49, but not sure.\n\nWait, maybe combine division and subtraction. Let's see: 77 - (29 + 11)/4. Let's compute denominator first: 29+11=40, 40/4=10. Then 77-10=67. Not 57.\n\nAlternatively, 29*(4) - (77/11). 29*4=116, 77/11=7. So 116-7=109. Nope.\n\nWait, what if we do 77 - 11 =66.

Alternatively, 57=29 + 28. How to get 28 from 11,4,77. 11*4=44, 77-44=33. No. 77/(11-4)=77/7=11. Then 29+11=40. Not 28.\n\nWait, maybe 77 - (4* (29 -11)). Let's compute: 29-11=18, 4*18=72. 77-72=5.

Maybe using subtraction first. 29 - 4=25. Then 25* something. 25*2.28≈57, but how to get 2.28. Alternatively, 11* (something) =57. 57/11≈5.18. Not sure.\n\nWait, 77 - (29 +4) =77-33=44. Then 44 +11=55. Close to 57. Hmm. Still 2 off. Maybe that's a clue. How to get those two?\n\nAlternatively, 77 - (29 - (11 -4)). Let's compute: 11-4=7, 29-7=22, 77-22=55. Same as before.\n\nWait, maybe 29 * (11 - (77 /4 )). Let's compute: 77/4=19.25, 11-19.25=-8.25. 29*(-8.25)= -239.25. No.\n\nHmm. Maybe using division in a way that gives a larger number. For example, (77 +29) =106. Then 106 / (something). 106 divided by 11 is around 9.63, then 9.63 *4=38.5. Not helpful.\n\nWait, 29 + 77=106. 106 - (11*4)=106-44=62. Then 62-5=57. But where's the 5? Not available.\n\nAlternatively, 11*4=44. 77-44=33. Then 33 +29=62. Again, same as before. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps (29 * 4) - (77 / 11). 29*4=116. 77/11=7. 116-7=109. Nope.\n\nAlternatively, 77 - (4* (29 -11)). 29-11=18. 4*18=72. 77-72=5. Not useful.\n\nWait another idea: 77 - 29 =48. Then 48 -11=37. Then 37 +4=41. Not helpful. Wait, but maybe 48 + (11-4)=48+7=55. Still 2 short.\n\nHmm. Maybe there's a way to use fractions. Like (77/11) + (29*4). 77/11=7, 29*4=116. 7+116=123. No. Or 77/(11) * (something). 7 * ... Maybe 7 * (29 -4)=7*25=175. Not helpful.\n\nWait, let me think again. 57 can be expressed as 29 + 28. How to get 28 from 11,4,77. 11*4=44. 77-44=33. Not 28. Alternatively, 77- (4* something). 4*7=28. 77-4*7=77-28=49. Then 49 + something. Not helpful.\n\nWait, but how to get 7? 77/11=7. Oh! So 77 divided by 11 is 7. Then 4*7=28. Then 28 +29=57. Yes! Let's check:\n\n77 / 11 =7\n\nThen 4 *7=28\n\n28 +29=57.\n\nSo the equation would be (77 / 11) *4 +29. But wait, we have to use all numbers exactly once. Let me see: 77, 11,4,29. Yes, all are used once. But in this equation, the operations are division, multiplication, and addition. Let me check the order of operations. First divide 77 by 11 to get 7, then multiply by 4 to get 28, then add 29 to get 57. So the equation is ((77 / 11) *4 ) +29 =57. But we need to make sure parentheses are correct. Alternatively, 77 / 11 *4 +29. Since division and multiplication have the same precedence, evaluated left to right. So 77 /11 is 7, multiplied by 4 is 28, plus 29 is 57. So the equation is 77 / 11 *4 +29. But since all numbers are used once, and operations are correct.\n\nWait, but does that use all numbers? Let's see: 77, 11,4,29. Yes. So the equation would be (77 / 11) * 4 + 29 = 57. Let me verify:\n\n77 divided by 11 is 7, 7 times 4 is 28, 28 plus 29 is 57. Correct. So that's the equation.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(77 / 11) * 4 + 29 = 57</answer>"}]}

Let me check the numbers again: 316 is the largest here. Maybe use 316 as a base and add or subtract other numbers. Let's see, 316 multiplied by something? 316*2 is 632, which is 19 more than 613. But I don't have a 2. Alternatively, 316 plus 63 is 379, which is still way lower. Hmm. Wait, 316 plus 33 is 349. Still not close. 316 times 2 is 632, but as I thought before, that's 19 over. How can I get 19? Let's see, the remaining numbers would be 63, 33, and 7. Maybe 33 minus 14? But 14 is 7*2, but I can't use 7 twice. Alternatively, 63 divided by 7 is 9. 33 minus 9 is 24. Not helpful. Wait, maybe 316*2 - something. Wait, but how do I get 2? Since I need to use all numbers, maybe combine 63, 33, 7 in a way that gives me 19 to subtract from 632. Let's think: 63 divided by 7 is 9. Then 33 minus 9 is 24. So 316*2 -24 would be 632-24=608. Not 613. Hmm. Alternatively, 316*2 - (33 - 63/7). Let's compute that: 63/7=9, 33-9=24, 316*2=632, 632-24=608. Still not. Not helpful. Maybe another approach.\n\nWhat if I try adding 316 and 33 first? 316+33=349. Then 349 + 63=412. Still too low. Then 412 +7=419. Not close. Alternatively, multiply 316 by 2: but again, how to get 2. Maybe 63 divided by 7 is 9. So 316*9 would be way too big. 316*9=2844. That's way over.

Alternatively, 63 - (33/7). Wait, 33 divided by 7 is approximately 4.714. 63 minus that is around 58.285. 316 + 58.285 is about 374.285, which is not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe 316 + (63 * 7).

Maybe 316 divided by something. For example, 316/(7) is around 45.14. Then 45.14 + 63 +33 = 141.14. No, not helpful. Alternatively, 316/(63/7) which is 316/9 ≈35.11. Then 35.11 +33=68.11.

But 24 is 5 more than 19. Hmm. Alternatively, 63 divided by something. 63/(7) =9. Then 33-9=24 again. Still not 19. What if we do 63 - (33 +7)=63-40=23. Still not 19. Or 63 -33 -7=23. Same.

Not close. 307* something? 307*2=614. Close to 613. But how to get 2. Wait, but I have used 63,7,316. The remaining number is 33. How can I get a 2 from 33? 33 divided by something. But 33 isn't divisible by 7. Hmm. Maybe 33 - (316/ something). Wait, 316 divided by 63 is about 5. So 33-5=28. 307*28 is way over.\n\nWait, another angle. Maybe (316 - 7) * something. 316-7=309. 309*2=618. Close to 613, 5 over. How to get 5. Then 618 -5=613. So 5 would need to come from 63 and 33. Let's see. 63 divided by 33 is roughly 1.9, which is close to 2. Not helpful. 33- (63/ something). 63 divided by 7 is 9, 33-9=24. But that's 24. So 309*2 -24=618-24=594. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe 316 + 33 = 349. Then 349 * something. 349*1.75=610.75. Close to 613. How to get 1.75. 7 divided by 4 is 1.75. But where do I get 4 from? 63- something. 63-59=4. But 59 isn't a number here. Alternatively, (63/ (something)). 63/36=1.75. But 36 isn't available. Hmm. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about fractions. Maybe (63 * 33) / 7. Let's compute that: 63*33=2079. 2079/7=297. Then 297 +316=613. Wait, that's 297+316=613. Oh! Wait, that works. Let me check:\n\n63 * 33 = 2079. Then 2079 divided by 7 is 297. Then 297 +316=613. But have I used all numbers? Let's see: 63, 33, 7 are used in (63*33)/7. Then adding 316. Yes, all numbers are used once. So the equation would be ((63 * 33) / 7) + 316 = 613. Let me verify:\n\n63 *33 = 2079. 2079 /7 = 297. 297 +316=613. Yes! That works. So the equation is (63 * 33 / 7) + 316 = 613.\n</think>\n\n<answer>((63 * 33) / 7) + 316 = 613</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using the numbers 20, 10, 228, and 4, each exactly once, with basic arithmetic operations, and the result should be 456. Hmm. Let me start by thinking about the target number, 456. Maybe I can break it down into factors or see how the given numbers can combine to reach it.\n\nFirst, 456 is a bit more than double 228. Wait, 228 * 2 = 456. But I don't have a 2 here. But I do have 20 and 10. Maybe subtract or divide those to get a 2. For example, 20 / 10 = 2. So if I can do 228 * (20 / 10), that would be 228 * 2 = 456. Then what about the remaining number, which is 4? Oh, but the problem says I must use all the numbers. So that approach would use 20, 10, 228, but leave out 4. So that doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the 4 somehow. Let's see. If I multiply 228 by 2 to get 456, but need to use 4. Maybe 228 * (20 / 10) + 4? But that would be 456 + 4 = 460, which is too much. Or subtract 4: 228 * 2 -4 = 456 -4=452. Not right. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use 4 as part of the multiplication. Let's think. 20 * 10 = 200, which is not close. 228 * 4 = 912. Then 912 divided by something. 912 / 2 = 456. But where do I get the 2 from? Using 20/10 gives 2. So maybe (228 * 4) * (20 / 10). Wait, that would be 228*4=912, then 912 * (20/10) = 912*2=1824. No, that's way too big. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe (228 + 4) * (20 / 10). Let's check: 228+4=232, times 2 (from 20/10) is 464. Close to 456 but off by 8. Hmm.\n\nAnother angle: 456 divided by 228 is 2. So 2 * 228 = 456. So how can I get 2 using 20,10,4. Let's see: 20/(10 + 4) = 20/14 ≈1.428, not 2. Or (20 -10)/4=10/4=2.5. Not 2. 20/(10/4) = 20/(2.5)=8. That's 8. So 8*228=1824. No. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe 10 - (20 /4) =10 -5=5. Then 5* something? 5*228=1140. No. Doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, 20 -10 =10. Then 10 *4=40. Then 40*228=9120. Way too big. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe use division in a different way. Let's see: 228 * (20 - (10 /4)). Let's compute that: 10/4 is 2.5. 20 -2.5=17.5. 228*17.5= Let's compute that. 228*17=3876, 228*0.5=114, total 3876+114=3990. Not 456. Nope.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe 228 + (something) =456. Then that something would be 228. But how to get 228 from 20,10,4. Let's see: 20*10=200, plus 4=204. No. 20*10*4=800. No. 20+10+4=34. Not enough. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe 228 * 4 =912. Then 912 divided by something. Let's see, 912 / 2=456. So how to get 2 from 20 and10. 20/10=2. So maybe (228 *4) / (20/10). Let's compute that: 228*4=912, divided by (20/10)=2. So 912/2=456. That works! And uses all numbers: 228,4,20,10. Let's check: 228*4/(20/10). So operations used are multiply, divide, and divide again. The numbers used once each. Yes. So the equation is (228 × 4) ÷ (20 ÷ 10) = 456. Let me verify: 20 divided by 10 is 2. Then 228 multiplied by 4 is 912. 912 divided by 2 is 456. Perfect. That uses all four numbers and the operations correctly. So that's the equation.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(228 * 4) / (20 / 10) = 456</answer>"}]}

Let's start by thinking about the operations. Since 897 is the largest number, maybe I can subtract something from it to get close to 832. Let's check: 897 minus 832 is 65. So I need to make 65 using the remaining numbers 21, 54, and 10.\n\nWait, how can I combine 21, 54, and 10 to get 65? Let's try adding them: 21 + 54 = 75, plus 10 is 85. That's too much. If I subtract instead: 54 - 21 = 33, plus 10 is 43. Not enough. Maybe multiplication or division. Let's see. If I do 54 divided by 10, that's 5.4. Then 21 + 5.4 is 26.4. Still not 65. \n\nAlternatively, maybe 21 times 10 is 210. Then 210 plus 54 is 264. That's way too big. Hmm. What if I do 54 minus 10? That's 44. Then 44 plus 21 is 65! Oh, wait, that works! So 54 - 10 = 44, then 44 +21=65. So then 897 - (54 -10 +21) = 897 -65=832. But wait, do I need to use all the numbers? Let me check. The numbers used would be 897,54,10,21. Yes, all four. So the equation would be 897 - (54 -10 +21) =832. But wait, the parentheses need to be correct. Let me write that properly. It's 897 - (54 -10 +21). Wait, 54-10 is 44, then 44+21=65. So 897 -65=832. But does the order of operations matter here? Let me check. If I write 897 -54 -10 +21, that would be 897-54=843, then 843-10=833, then 833+21=854. No, that's not right. So I need to group the 54-10 together, then add 21. So the expression would be 897 - (54 -10 +21). But wait, in that case, according to order of operations, addition and subtraction are left to right. So 54 -10 +21 would be (54-10) +21=44+21=65. So parentheses are okay there. Alternatively, maybe 897 - (54 - (10 +21))? That would be 54 -31=23, 897-23=874. No. So the correct grouping is 897 - (54 -10 +21). Wait, but 54-10+21 is the same as (54-10)+21, which is correct. So the equation is 897 - (54 -10 +21) =832. Let me verify: 54-10=44, 44+21=65. 897-65=832. Yes! That works. So the equation is 897 - (54 -10 +21) =832. But do I need to write it as 897 -54 +10 -21? Wait, no. Because 897 - (54 -10 +21) is equivalent to 897 -54 +10 -21. Let me check: 54-10+21=65. 897-65=832. Alternatively, 897-54=843, 843+10=853, 853-21=832. Yes, that's the same. So another way to write it without parentheses is 897 -54 +10 -21. But maybe using parentheses makes it clearer. The problem allows basic operations and parentheses. So either form is acceptable. Let me check if all numbers are used once: 897,54,10,21. Yes, all four. So the equation could be either 897 -54 +10 -21 =832 or 897 - (54 -10 +21) =832. Both are correct, but perhaps the first one is more straightforward. Wait, but let me check the arithmetic again. 897-54 is 843. Then 843+10=853. Then 853-21=832. Correct. So the equation is 897 -54 +10 -21=832. So the answer would be (897 -54) +10 -21, but actually, since subtraction and addition are left associative, it can be written without parentheses. So the equation is 897 -54 +10 -21 =832. Let me write that.\n</think>\n\n<answer>897 - 54 + 10 - 21 = 832</answer>"}]}

Let me start by thinking about the larger numbers first since 830 is quite big. Maybe subtract something from 830 to get closer to 738. 830 minus what? Let's check 830 - 74 = 756. That's still higher than 738. Then 830 - 83 = 747. Still higher. So maybe subtract more. But 830 - (something multiplied by something else). Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe multiply some numbers. If I take 83 and multiply by something. 83*9 is 747, which is close. But how to get 9? Wait, 74 and 2 and 830. Not sure. Wait, maybe 83* (830/(74+2)). Let me compute that. 74+2 is 76. 830 divided by 76 is roughly 10.92, so 83*10.92 is around 906. That's too high. Hmm.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe combine 830 and 2 first. Like 830 divided by 2 is 415. Then 415 plus or minus other numbers. 415 + 83 = 498, then +74=572. No. Not enough. 415 -83=332, then 332 +74=406. Still not close.\n\nWait, 830 minus 83 is 747. Then 747 minus 9 is 738. But how to get 9 from 74 and 2. 74 divided by something. 74 divided by 8 is 9.25, but I don't have 8. Wait, 74 minus 2 is 72. 72 divided by 8 is 9, but again, no 8. Alternatively, 74 - (2 * something). Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe 83 * 9 = 747. Then 747 - 9 = 738. Wait, but again, how to get the 9. Alternatively, maybe 74 divided by 2 is 37. Then 830 - 83 - 37 = 830 - 120 = 710. Not 738. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, 830 minus (83 multiplied by something). Let's say 83 * 2 = 166. 830 - 166 = 664. Then 664 + 74 = 738! Wait, that works. Let me check: 83*2 is 166. Then 830 - 166 is 664. 664 +74 is 738. Yes! But wait, are all numbers used? 830, 83, 2, 74. Yes, each once. So the equation would be 830 - (83 * 2) + 74 = 738. Let me verify the calculation: 83*2=166. 830-166=664. 664+74=738. Correct.\n\nBut wait, do I need to use all four numbers? The problem says use all the numbers, so 830,83,2,74. In this equation, all are used. So yes. So the equation is 830 - 83 * 2 +74 =738. But the order of operations might require parentheses. Let me check: without parentheses, it would be 830 - (83*2) +74, which is correct. So maybe the equation is (830 - 83 * 2) +74. But maybe parentheses aren't necessary. Alternatively, write it as 830 +74 -83*2. Either way, the result is the same. So the equation is 830 +74 -83*2 =738. Let me check again: 83*2=166. 830+74=904. 904-166=738. Yes. That works. So the answer is 830 +74 -83*2. But to make the order explicit, maybe write 830 +74 - (83*2). But the problem allows any as long as operations are correct.

So does that mean we have two separate 2s that can both be used? The problem states \"each number can only be used once\", but since there are two 2s, maybe they are considered separate instances. So I can use both 2s as long as each is used once. So the numbers available are two 2s, 997, and 95. Need to use all of them.\n\nThe target is 903. Let's think about possible operations. Let's start by looking at the largest number, which is 997. Maybe if I subtract something from 997 to get 903. Let's check: 997 - 903 = 94. So if I can make 94 from the remaining numbers (2, 95, 2), that would work. Wait, 95 is one of the numbers. If I subtract 95, then 997 - 95 = 902. Close, but not 903. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe I can add or subtract other numbers.\n\nAlternatively, let's see what 95 multiplied by something gives. 95 * 9.5 is 902.5, which is close, but not an integer. Wait, but maybe combining 95 with the 2s. Let's see: 95 * 2 = 190. If I take 997 and subtract 190, that's 997 - 190 = 807, not 903. Not helpful. Or maybe 95 plus 2 is 97. 997 minus 97 is 900, which is close. Then 900 plus 3, but I don't have a 3. Wait, but maybe use the other 2. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 997 minus (95 + 2 + 2) = 997 - 99 = 898. Not 903. That's not working.\n\nAlternatively, maybe multiply 95 by one of the 2s. 95 * 2 = 190. Then, 2 remains. How can 997, 190, and 2 get to 903? Let's see. 190 + 2 = 192. 997 - 192 = 805. No. 997 - 190 is 807, then 807 +2=809. Not 903. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe adding 997 and something. 997 + x = 903, so x would have to be negative. But we have positive numbers left. Maybe that's not the way.\n\nAlternatively, think about division. Let's see: 997 divided by 2 is 498.5. Not useful. 95 divided by 2 is 47.5. Maybe not helpful.\n\nWait, what if I use the two 2s to make 22 or something? But the problem says each number can only be used once. So concatenation isn't allowed unless specified. The problem didn't mention concatenation, so probably not allowed. So each number has to be used as is, with operations.\n\nWait, maybe 95 * (something) equals close to 903. Let's see 95 * 9.5 is around 900, but again, fractional. But maybe 95 * 9 + something. Wait, but how to get 9 from the numbers left. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use 997 - (95 * 2) + 2. Let's compute that: 95*2=190. 997 - 190 = 807. Then 807 +2=809. Not 903.\n\nAlternatively, 95 * (2 + 2) = 95*4=380. Then 997 - 380=617. Not helpful. 997 - 95*2*2= 997-380=617. No.\n\nAlternatively, think about 997 - (95 - (2 + 2))=997 - (95-4)=997-91=906. Close, but 3 off. But 906 is 3 more than 903. Hmm. Maybe that's not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe (997 - 95) * something. 997-95=902. Then 902 * (2/2) = 902. But that's 902, not 903. Close.

Maybe I can break it down into parts that could relate to the numbers provided.\n\nFirst, let me check if adding some of these numbers gets close. Let's see: 391 + 95 is 486. That's higher than 447. 391 + 74 is 465, still higher. 391 + 35 is 426, which is 21 less than 447. Maybe subtract something from there? But then I need to use the remaining numbers. If I do 391 + 35 = 426, then I have 95 and 74 left. Maybe 95 - 74 is 21. So 426 + 21 = 447. But how to combine that. Wait, 391 + 35 + (95 - 74) = 447. Let me check: 95 -74 is 21, 391 +35 is 426, then +21 is 447. That works. But I need to use all the numbers. Wait, in that equation, I'm using 391, 35, 95, and 74. Yes, all four. So the equation would be (391 + 35) + (95 -74) = 447. Let me compute that step by step. 391 +35 is 426. 95 -74 is 21. 426 +21 is 447. Perfect! So that works. Let me write it as (391 + 35) + (95 - 74) = 447. Alternatively, maybe without the parentheses, but since order of operations could matter. Let me check if parentheses are needed. If I write 391 +35 +95 -74, that's the same as (391+35+95) -74. Let's see: 391+35 is 426, +95 is 521, -74 is 447. Oh, wait, that's even simpler. So 391 +35 +95 -74 =447. But does that use all numbers once? Yes, 391,35,95,74 each used once. So that's a valid equation. Let me verify: 391+35 is 426, plus 95 is 521, minus 74 is 447. Yep, that's correct. So the equation is 391 + 35 + 95 - 74 = 447. That seems straightforward. Let me just make sure there isn't another combination. Maybe multiplying? For example, 95 * something. Let's see. 95 * 5 is 475, which is more than 447. 95*4=380. If I subtract that from 391: 391-380=11, then 74 +35=109. 11+109=120, which is way off. Not helpful. Alternatively, 74* something. 74*6=444, which is close. Then 444 +3=447. But where would I get the 3? Maybe 95-35=60, then 60 divided by something. 60/20=3, but 20 isn't available. Hmm. Maybe 391 - (something). 391 -95=296. Then 296 +35 +74= 296+109=405. Not enough. Alternatively, 391 - (95 +35) = 391-130=261. Then 261 +74=335. Not helpful. What if I multiply 35 and 74. 35*74=2590. That's way too big. Maybe divide. 2590 / something. Not sure. Alternatively, 95*35=3325, which is even bigger. So maybe multiplication isn't the way to go. Let me think again. The previous solution of 391 +35 +95 -74 works. Let me check if I can write it with parentheses, but it's not necessary since addition and subtraction are left to right. So the equation is valid. So I think that's the answer. Let me just confirm once again. 391 +35 is 426. 426 +95 is 521. 521 -74 is 447. Yes, correct. So all numbers used once, and the result is 447. That works.\n</think>\n\n<answer>391 + 35 + 95 - 74 = 447</answer>"}]}

Let me start by thinking about what operations might get me close. \n\nFirst, maybe multiplying some of the larger numbers. 88 is a big number. If I multiply 88 by something. Let's try 88 * 91. That's 88*90=7920, plus 88*1=88, so 7920+88=8008. That's way too big. But maybe subtract something? 8008 minus the other numbers. Wait, the other numbers I have left would be 4 and 32. 4 +32=36. So 8008-36=7972. Still way over. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe divide instead. Let's see. If I take 91 and divide it by 4, that's 22.75. Then multiply by 88? 88*22.75. Let me calculate that: 88*20=1760, 88*2.75=242. So total 1760+242=2002. Still not close to 795. Hmm.\n\nWhat if I combine 88 and 32 first. 88 +32=120. Then 120 * something. Let's see, 120*6=720, 120*7=840. 795 is between those. But how to get 6.75? The remaining numbers are 91 and 4. Maybe 91 divided by 4 is 22.75, which doesn't help. Maybe 91 minus 4 is 87, but 120*87 is way too big. Not useful.\n\nAnother approach: Let's think about 795. It's 800 -5. So can I make 800 and subtract 5? But I need to use 88,4,91,32. Let's see. 88*9=792, which is close. But how to get 9? 91 divided by something. 91/ (4 + something). Wait, 91 divided by (32/4) is 91/8=11.375. Then 88*11.375= 88*11=968, 88*0.375=33. So total 1001. No, that's not it.\n\nWait, 88 * 9 = 792, and 792 plus 3 is 795. So maybe 792 +3 =795. How to get 3 from the remaining numbers. The remaining numbers would be 4,91,32. Let's see. 91 minus (32 +4) is 91-36=55. Not 3. Or 32 divided by something. 32/4=8. Then 91 -8=83. Still not 3. Alternatively, 91 - (32* something). 32*2=64, 91-64=27. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 4*(something) to get 3? Not directly. Maybe fractions. 32 divided by (91/4). Let's compute that: 32/(22.75)= approximately 1.405. Still not 3.\n\nHmm. Maybe another approach. Let's try 91*4=364. Then 364 + 88=452. Then 452*32 is way too big. 452*30=13,560 plus 452*2=904, total 14,464. No.\n\nWhat if we subtract? 91*32=2912. Then 2912 - 88=2824. Divided by 4 gives 706. Not 795.\n\nWait, 795 divided by 88 is approximately 9.03. So if I can make 9.03 using 4,91,32. Let's see: 91 divided by (32/4) is 91/(8)=11.375. Which is more than 9.03. Alternatively, (32 -4)=28. 91/28=3.25. Then 88*3.25= 286. Not helpful.\n\nWhat if I do 91 - (32/4) =91-8=83. Then 88*83= 88*80=7040 +88*3=264 → 7304. That's way over. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 88*(4 + 32). 4+32=36. 88*36=3168. Then subtract 91? 3168-91=3077. Not 795.\n\nWait, 91*32=2912. Then 2912 divided by 4 is 728. Then 728 +88=816. Closer but still not 795.\n\nAlternatively, 91*8 =728. Wait, but 8 would come from 32/4=8. So that's 91*(32/4) =91*8=728. Then 728 +88=816. Still not. Then maybe subtract something? But we've already used all numbers. Wait, 91*(32/4) +88=816. But 816 is 21 over. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe 91*(32 - 4) =91*28=2548. Then 2548 divided by something. 2548/88=29. Hmm. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 91*4=364. 364 +32=396. 88* (something) =795. 795/88≈9.03. So 396/88=4.5. Not 9.03. Not helpful.\n\nAnother angle: 88* (something) = 795. Let's see. 795 ÷88=9.034... So need to make 9.034 with 4,32,91. Let's see: 32 - (91/4)=32 -22.75=9.25. Close to 9.03. Then 88*(32 -91/4)=88*(9.25)=88*9 +88*0.25=792 +22=814. Hmm, 814. Not 795. But maybe if we can adjust that. Wait, 814-19=795. But where would 19 come from? We've already used all numbers. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe subtract instead. Let's try 91*4=364. Then 88*32=2816. 2816 -364=2452. Divided by 4 is 613. No.\n\nWait, 88*32=2816. 2816 -91=2725. 2725 divided by 4 is 681.25. Not helpful.\n\nWhat if I do 88 + 91=179. 179*4=716. Then 716 +32=748. Not enough.\n\nAlternatively, 88 -4=84. 84*91= 84*90=7560 +84=7644. Then 7644 divided by 32= 7644/32≈238.875. Nope.\n\nHmm. Maybe use division in a smarter way. Let's see. 91 divided by 4 is 22.75. 88*22.75=2002. Then 2002 -32=1970. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe 91 -32=59. 59*4=236. 88*236= 88*(200+36)=17,600 +3,168=20,768. Way over.\n\nAlternatively, 88*4=352. 352 +91=443. 443*32=14,176. No.\n\nWait, 91*32=2912. 2912 divided by 4=728. Then 728 +88=816. As before. But how to get from 816 to 795? Maybe subtract 21, but where would 21 come from? But we already used all numbers. So that path might not work.\n\nAlternatively, 91* (88 -32) =91*56=5096. Then 5096 divided by 4=1274. No.\n\nHmm. Maybe subtract and multiply. Let's try (91 -4)=87. 87* (88 -32)=87*56=4872. Divided by something? But we've used all numbers except maybe divide by 1, which isn't allowed. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe (88 * (91 - (32/4)) ). Let's compute that. 32/4=8. 91-8=83. 88*83=7304. No.\n\nAnother approach: Let's think about 795. 800 -5. How to make 800? 88 *9 + something. Wait, 88*9=792. So 792 +3=795. But how to get 3 from 4,32,91. Let's see. 32 divided by (something). 32/(91-4)=32/87≈0.367. Not helpful. Or 91/(32+4)=91/36≈2.527. Not 3. Alternatively, 91 -32=59. 59-4=55. Not 3. 4 - (91-32)=4-59=-55. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe fractions. If I can use 4 to divide into something. For example, 32/4=8. Then 91-8=83. Then 88*83=7304. Not helpful. But if 88*(something) minus or plus another term. Wait, maybe 88*(32/4) +91= 88*8 +91=704 +91=795. Wait, that works! Let's check the numbers:\n\n88 * (32 /4 ) +91 = 88*(8) +91=704 +91=795. And all numbers are used once: 88, 32,4,91. Exactly. Yes! So that's the equation: 88*(32/4) +91 =795. Let me verify again:\n\n32 divided by 4 is 8. 88 multiplied by 8 is 704. 704 plus 91 is 795. Perfect. All numbers used once. Operations are division, multiplication, and addition. Yep, that's it.\n</think>\n\n<answer>88 * (32 / 4) + 91 = 795</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using the numbers 96, 98, 16, and 5 exactly once each, with basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) any number of times, and the result should be 602. Hmm, 602 is a bit large, so maybe multiplication will be involved here. Let me start by thinking about possible combinations.\n\nFirst, let me list out all the numbers: 96, 98, 16, 5. The target is 602. Let's see. If I multiply some of the larger numbers together, maybe that can get close. For example, 96 * 6 is 576, but that's not enough. Wait, 98 * 6 is 588. Still not 602. Hmm. Alternatively, 96 + 98 is 194. That's way too low. Maybe 98 * 5 is 490. Then adding 96 would get me 586. Still not there. \n\nWhat if I subtract something? Let's see. If I take 98 and multiply by 5, that's 490. Then subtract 16 from that? 490 - 16 = 474. Then add 96? 474 + 96 = 570. Still not 602.\n\nWait, maybe I need to combine operations differently. Let's think about division. Maybe 16 divided by something. For instance, 16 / 5 is 3.2. Then 98 * 3.2 would be 98*3 + 98*0.2 = 294 + 19.6 = 313.6. Then 96 + 313.6 is 409.6. No, that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, if I use 96 and 5. Let's see 96 * 5 is 480. Then 480 + 98 = 578, plus 16 is 594. Still 8 short. Hmm. Or 480 + 16 is 496. 496 + 98 is 594 again. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe 98 * (16 - 5) + 96? Let's check: 16 -5 is 11. 98 * 11 is 1078. Then add 96: 1078 + 96 = 1174. Way too big. No.\n\nOr maybe 98 * 5 + 96 * something. 98*5=490. 96* (16 / something). Wait, 16 divided by something. If I do 96*(16/5) that's 96*3.2=307.2. 307.2 +490=797.2. No. That's over.\n\nAlternatively, 96*5=480. Then 98 + 16=114. 480 +114=594. Still 8 short. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe using division to get a larger number. Let's see. For example, 98 * (96 / 16) +5. Let's compute 96 divided by 16 is 6. Then 98*6=588. 588 +5=593. Still 9 less than 602.\n\nOr 98 * (96 / (16 -5)). Let's see: 16 -5=11. 96/11 is roughly 8.727. 98*8.727 ≈ 855. Then that's way over. Not helpful.\n\nHow about 98 * 5 + 96 + 16? Wait, 98*5=490 +96=586 +16=602. Wait, that's exactly 602! Let me check again: 98 multiplied by 5 is 490. Then add 96: 490 +96 = 586. Then add 16: 586 +16=602. Oh! Wait, that works. But wait, I need to use all numbers once. So 98 *5 uses 98 and 5. Then adding 96 and 16. So that's 98*5 +96 +16. All numbers used once. Let me calculate:\n\n98 *5 = 490\n\n490 +96 = 586\n\n586 +16 = 602. Yes! That works. So the equation is 98*5 +96 +16 = 602. But I should write it using all numbers once and the operations. So the equation would be (98 × 5) + 96 + 16 = 602. But since all operations are allowed, and each number is used once. Let me check: 98,5,96,16 are all used once. The operations are multiplication and addition. Yes, that's allowed. So that's the solution. But I need to make sure there's no mistake here. Wait, 98*5 is 490. 490 +96 is 586, then +16 is 602. Correct. That adds up. So yeah, that's the answer.\n</think>\n\n<answer>98 * 5 + 96 + 16 = 602</answer>"}]}

So if I take (297 / 99) which is 3, and multiply that by (72 / 36) which is 2, then 3 * 2 = 6. Let me check that again: (297 ÷ 99) × (72 ÷ 36) = 3 × 2 = 6. That uses all four numbers once each.

The numbers 70 and 79 are both large. If I add them together, 70 + 79 is 149. That's 13 more than 136. Maybe I can subtract something from that sum. The remaining numbers are 11 and 2. If I subtract 11 and 2 from 149, that's 136. Wait, but how do I use all four numbers? Because 70 + 79 - 11 - 2 would be 136. Let me check: 70 +79 is 149, minus 11 is 138, minus 2 is 136. Yes! That works. But wait, do I have to use all the operations? No, the problem says you can use the operations any number of times, but each number once. So the equation would be 70 + 79 - 11 - 2 = 136.

Let me break it down to see if I can find factors that might relate to the given numbers. 630 divided by 10 is 63, but I don't have a 10. Alternatively, 630 is 70 times 9, or 21 times 30. Wait, 21 is one of the numbers here. So if I can get 21 multiplied by something to get 630, that might work. Let's see: 630 divided by 21 is 30. So if I can make 30 from the remaining numbers (92, 98, 36), that would work. But how?\n\nThe remaining numbers are 92, 98, 36. Let's see. 92 and 98 are both close to 100. Maybe subtract them? 98 minus 92 is 6. Then 6 plus 36 is 42. Not 30. Alternatively, 36 divided by something? 36 divided by (98 - 92) is 36/6=6. Then 21*6=126. Not 630. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe combine 98 and 36 first. 98 minus 36 is 62. Then 92 minus 62 is 30. Oh, that's interesting. So 92 - (98 - 36) = 92 - 62 = 30. Then multiply that by 21: 21 * 30 = 630. Let me check that:\n\n21 * (92 - (98 - 36)) = 21 * (92 - 62) = 21 * 30 = 630. Yes! That uses all numbers once. Let me verify each number is used once: 21, 92, 98, 36. Yes, all used.

Let me start by thinking about possible combinations.\n\nFirst, I should note that 130 is a relatively large number, so maybe adding some of these numbers together could get close. Let me check the sum of all numbers: 66 + 28 + 68 + 84 = 246, which is way over. So addition alone isn't the way. Maybe a combination of addition and subtraction?\n\nAlternatively, maybe multiplication and division can help reduce some of the larger numbers. Let's look at the larger numbers: 84 and 68.

Let's see, 28 is a smaller number. Maybe 84 / 28 = 3. Then 3 * something. If I do 84 / 28 = 3, then 3 * 66 = 198. Then subtract 68: 198 - 68 = 130. Wait, that could work.

Let me verify:\n\n84 divided by 28 is 3. 3 multiplied by 66 is 198. 198 minus 68 is indeed 130. That works! So the equation would be (84 / 28) * 66 - 68. Let me just make sure all numbers are used once and only the allowed operations. Yes, division, multiplication, and subtraction. Each number is used once. That should be correct.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(84 / 28) * 66 - 68 = 130</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using all the numbers 21, 42, 66, and 38 exactly once each, with basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) any number of times, and the result should be 142. Hmm, let's start by thinking about the target number, 142. It's a bit high, so maybe multiplication or addition is needed. Let me try different combinations.\n\nFirst, let's list the numbers: 21, 42, 66, 38. All of them need to be used. Let's see what combinations might get close to 142. Let's try adding some of the larger numbers first. For example, 66 + 42 is 108. Then adding 38 would get us 146, which is 4 more than 142. Then maybe subtract 21? Wait, 146 - 21 = 125. That's not enough. Alternatively, maybe 66 + 38 = 104, then add 42 to get 146 again. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, what if we multiply some numbers? Let's see. 21 and 42 can be multiplied, but 21*42 is 882, which is way too big. Maybe 66*2 is 132, but I don't have a 2. Wait, 66 divided by something? 66 divided by (something) might give a fraction. Let me think.\n\nWhat if we take 66 and subtract something to get part of the total. Let's see. 66 - 21 = 45. Then 45 + 42 = 87, plus 38 is 125. Still not enough. Hmm. Maybe 42 multiplied by 3 is 126, but how to get 3 from the other numbers? 21 divided by 7, but 7 isn't present. Alternatively, 38 divided by something. Maybe 66 - 38 = 28. Then 28 + 42 = 70. 70 * 2 = 140, but again, no 2. Wait, 21 is there. Maybe 70 + 21 = 91. Not helpful.\n\nAnother approach: Let's try to reach 142 by combining operations. For example, 142 is even. Let's see if we can get even numbers. 42 and 38 are even. 66 is even too. 21 is odd. Maybe combining even numbers first. Let's see: 42 + 38 = 80. Then 66 + 21 = 87. 80 + 87 = 167, which is too high. If we subtract instead: 66 - 21 = 45, then 45 + 42 = 87, then 87 + 38 = 125. Still not.\n\nWait, maybe using division. Let's see if dividing one of the numbers can help. For instance, 66 divided by something. 66 / 21 is about 3.14. Maybe 66 / 21 = 3.142..., then multiply by 42: 3.142 *42 ≈ 132, then add 38: 132+38=170. No. Not helpful. Alternatively, 42 divided by 21 is 2. Then 2 * 66 = 132, plus 38 = 170 again. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, 38 divided by something. Let's see, 38/21 ≈1.8095. Then multiply by 42: 1.8095 *42 ≈76, then 76 +66=142. Wait, that's interesting. Let me check:\n\n38 / 21 = 38/21 ≈1.8095. Then multiply by 42: (38/21)*42 = 38*2 =76. Then 76 +66 = 142. Oh! Wait, that works! Let's see:\n\n(38 / 21) * 42 + 66. Let's verify:\n\nFirst, 38 divided by 21 is (38/21). Then multiplied by 42: (38/21)*42 = 38*2=76. Then add 66: 76+66=142. Yes! That uses all four numbers: 38, 21, 42, and 66. Each exactly once. The operations used are division, multiplication, and addition. So the equation would be (38 / 21) * 42 + 66 = 142. Let me check again: 38 divided by 21 is 38/21. Multiply by 42 gives (38/21)*42 = 38*(42/21) = 38*2 =76. Then 76 +66=142. Exactly. That works. So the equation is (38 / 21) * 42 + 66 = 142.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(38 / 21) * 42 + 66 = 142</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using the numbers 39, 622, 910, and 76, each exactly once, with basic operations, to get 403. Hmm, 403 is a prime number, so that might complicate things. Let me start by looking at the numbers provided.\n\nFirst, let's note the target is 403. The numbers available are 39, 622, 910, and 76. They are all different in magnitude. Let's think about possible combinations. Since 403 is about 400, maybe combining 910 (which is over 900) with subtraction or division could bring it down. Alternatively, maybe adding some numbers and subtracting others. Let's try different approaches.\n\nLet me list the numbers again: 39, 622, 910, 76. Need to use all. Maybe start with the largest number, 910, and see how to reduce it. If I subtract something from 910 to get near 403, that would require subtracting around 507. Do I have numbers that can combine to make 507? Let's see: 622 is one of them. If I subtract 622 from 910, that gives 288. Not enough. But maybe combining 622 with others. Wait, 910 - (622 + 76) = 910 - 698 = 212. Still not 403.\n\nAlternatively, maybe multiply some numbers. For example, 76 is a smaller number. If I multiply 76 by something. Let's see, 76 * 5 is 380, which is close to 403. But how do I get 5? Maybe from other numbers. Let's see, 39 divided by 76? No. 39 divided by something else. Wait, if I take 910 divided by something. 910 divided by 76 is approximately 12. Maybe that's not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, 622 divided by 39. Let's calculate: 622 ÷ 39 ≈ 15.95. Hmm. Not sure. 910 divided by 76 is around 12. Maybe 910/76 is about 12, then 12 * 39 = 468. Then subtract 468 - 622 would be negative. Not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps combining addition and subtraction. Let's try 910 - 622 = 288. Then, maybe 288 + 76 + 39 = 403? Let's check: 288 +76=364, 364+39=403. Oh, wait! That actually works. So 910 - 622 + 76 + 39 = 403. Let me verify:\n\n910 - 622 is 288. 288 +76 is 364, plus 39 is 403. Yes! But wait, does this use all the numbers once each? Yes: 910, 622, 76, 39. All used. But the operations are subtraction and additions. So the equation would be (910 - 622) + 76 + 39 = 403. But according to the problem statement, we can use the operations as needed, but each number once. So that works. Let me write it as 910 - 622 + 76 + 39. Let me check again:\n\n910 - 622 = 288. 288 +76 = 364. 364 +39 = 403. Yep, that's correct. So this equation uses all four numbers once each with operations of subtraction and addition. So that's a valid solution.\n</think>\n\n<answer>910 - 622 + 76 + 39 = 403</answer>"}]}

Let's see. 259 is a prime number, but maybe we can get close and adjust. Let's see what operations might get us there.\n\nLet's consider the larger numbers first. 95 is the largest. If I subtract something from 95, could that help? Or maybe add. Alternatively, multiplying some numbers. Let's try different combinations.\n\nWait, 95 multiplied by something. 95*3=285, which is higher than 259. So maybe 95*2.7... but we can only use integers. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe 95 plus something. 95 + 64 = 159. That's too low. 95 + 64 + 46 = 205. Still low. Then add 11: 205+11=216. Still under 259. So adding all of them gives 216. Not enough.\n\nWhat if I subtract instead? 95 - 64 = 31. Then 31 +46=77. 77 +11=88. Not helpful. Maybe a different approach.\n\nWhat if I use multiplication between two numbers? Let's see. 64*4=256, which is close to 259. But 4 isn't one of the numbers. Wait, maybe 64* something. 64*4=256, so adding 3 would get to 259. But 3 isn't available. Alternatively, maybe 64* (something) plus another number.\n\nWait, 95 is a big number. If I do 64*3=192. But again, 3 isn't in the numbers. Alternatively, 46*5=230. Then 230 +29=259. But 29 isn't available. Hmm.\n\nAnother angle: 259 divided by 95 is about 2.726. Not helpful. 259 divided by 64 is about 4.046. Maybe using division here.\n\nWait, maybe combine 95 and 64. Let's see: 95 + 64 = 159. Then 159 + 46 = 205. Then 205 +11=216. No. Alternatively, 95 - 64=31. 31 * something. 31*8=248. Close to 259. 31*8.387. But again, fractions. How can I get 8? Let's see, 46 divided by something? 46/11≈4.18. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe 95 multiplied by 2. Let me think. 95*2=190. Then 190 + 64=254. Then 254 +5=259. But 5 isn't available. But 46-11=35. 190 +64=254. 254 + (46-11)=254+35=289. Too much. Alternatively, 95*2 + (64 - (46-11))=190 + (64-35)=190+29=219. Still not.\n\nAlternatively, 64*4=256. 256 +3=259. But where to get 3? Maybe 11 - (something). 11 - 8=3. But 8 isn't a number here. Wait, 46 - (something)=3? 46-43=3. But 43 is not available. Maybe 11 - (46/ something). 46 divided by 11 is about 4.18, which isn't helpful.\n\nAnother approach: maybe 259 - 95 = 164. So need to make 164 with 64,46,11. How? Let's see. 64 +46=110. 110 +11=121. Not enough. 64*2=128. 128 +46=174. 174 -11=163. Close. 163 is one less than 164. Hmm. Not quite.\n\nAlternatively, 46*3=138. 138 + 64=202. 202 -11=191. Still not 164.\n\nWait, 64*2 +46=128+46=174. 174 -11=163. Still not. Maybe 46* (something). 46*3.5=161. But 3.5 is not available.\n\nWait, 64 + (46*2) =64+92=156. 156 +11=167. Still not 164. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, 64 +46=110. 110 * 1.5=165. But 1.5 isn't available. Maybe (64 +46) * (11/ something). 110*(11/x). If x is 7.3... but not helpful.\n\nHmm, maybe this isn't the right path. Let's try another angle.\n\nWhat if I try to use division to create fractions that can help. For example, 95 divided by something. 95/11 is approximately 8.636. If I multiply that by 64, that's way too big. 8.636*64≈552. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 64 divided by 11 is about 5.818. 5.818*46≈267.7. Close to 259. Maybe 64/11*46 ≈267.7, which is 8.7 over. Hmm. But we have to use exact operations. So perhaps (64/11)*46 would get us close, but it's not exact. But since we can't use fractions unless division results in integers, maybe this isn't possible.\n\nWait, maybe 95 - (64 + 46) =95 -110= -15. Then -15 +11= -4. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 95 - (64 -46) =95 -18=77. 77 +11=88. No.\n\nAnother idea: 46*11=506. 506 - (95 +64)=506 -159=347. Not helpful. Alternatively, 46*11=506. 506 -95=411. 411 -64=347. Still not.\n\nWait, 95*64=6080. Way too big. Maybe subtract something. 95*64 -46*11=6080 -506=5574. No.\n\nWait, maybe (95 + 64) * (46 -11). Let's compute that. 159 * 35=5565. Way too big.\n\nHmm. Let's think differently. Let's list possible combinations of two numbers and see what they can make.\n\nTake 95 and 64: 95+64=159, 95-64=31, 64-95=-31, 95*64=6080, 95/64≈1.484, 64/95≈0.673.\n\nSimilarly for other pairs.\n\n95 and 46: 95+46=141, 95-46=49, 46-95=-49, 95*46=4370, 95/46≈2.065, 46/95≈0.484.\n\n95 and 11: 95+11=106, 95-11=84, 11-95=-84, 95*11=1045, 95/11≈8.636, 11/95≈0.115.\n\n64 and 46: 64+46=110, 64-46=18, 46-64=-18, 64*46=2944, 64/46≈1.391, 46/64≈0.719.\n\n64 and 11: 64+11=75, 64-11=53, 11-64=-53, 64*11=704, 64/11≈5.818, 11/64≈0.172.\n\n46 and 11: 46+11=57, 46-11=35, 11-46=-35, 46*11=506, 46/11≈4.181, 11/46≈0.239.\n\nNow, let's see. Maybe combine some of these intermediate results. For example, 95-46=49. Then 49* something. 49*5.285=259. But 5.285... Not helpful. Alternatively, 49*5=245. 245 +14=259. 14 can come from 64-50, but 50 isn't available. Hmm.\n\nWait, 95-46=49. Then 49* (64 -11). Let's calculate that. 64-11=53. 49*53=2597. Way too big.\n\nAlternatively, 95+64=159. 159 + (46* something). 46*2=92. 159+92=251. Then 251+8=259. 8 from 11-3. But 3 isn't here. Alternatively, 46* something else. 46*5=230. 159+230=389. No.\n\nWait, maybe 64* something plus 95. 64*4=256. 256+3=259. But 3 from where? 11-8=3, but 8 isn't available. Alternatively, 46/11≈4.18. 64*4.18≈267. Then 267 -8=259. But again, not exact.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (95 - (46/11)) * something. Let's see, 46/11≈4.18. 95-4.18≈90.82. 90.82*2.85≈259. But not exact.\n\nWait, perhaps using division in a clever way. For example, 64 divided by something. Let's try 64/(11- something). Suppose 11 - (95/46). 95/46≈2.065. 11-2.065≈8.935. Then 64/8.935≈7.16. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, (95 - 64) =31. Then 46 -11=35. 31 * 35=1085. No. Then 1085 vs 259. Not helpful.\n\nHmm, maybe try combining three numbers first. Like 64 +46 +11=121. Then 121 +95=216. No. Or 64*46=2944. Then 2944 divided by 11≈267.6. Close to 259. 267.6 -8.6=259. But 8.6 from where? Maybe 95/11≈8.636. So 2944/11 -95/11= (2944 -95)/11=2849/11≈259. So 2849 divided by 11 is exactly 259. Wait, that's 259*11=2849. Yes! So 2849/11=259. But how to get 2849 from the numbers 64,46,11,95, using each once. Wait, 64*46=2944. Then 2944 -95=2849. Then 2849 /11=259. So the equation would be (64*46 -95)/11=259. Let's check:\n\n64*46=2944. 2944-95=2849. 2849 divided by 11 is exactly 259. Because 259*11=2849. Yes! That works. So the equation is (64×46−95)/11=259. Let me verify:\n\n64 multiplied by 46: 64*40=2560, 64*6=384, so 2560+384=2944. Then subtract 95: 2944-95=2849. Then divide by 11: 2849 ÷11. 11×259=2849. Yes, because 259×10=2590, 259×1=259, total 2590+259=2849. Perfect. So that works. And we've used all four numbers: 64,46,95,11. Each exactly once, and the operations are multiplication, subtraction, and division. So the equation is (64*46 -95)/11 =259.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(64 * 46 - 95) / 11 = 259</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using the numbers 14, 78, 50, and 49, each exactly once, with basic arithmetic operations to get 191. Hmm. Let's start by thinking about the target number, 191. It's close to 200, so maybe subtract something from a larger number. Alternatively, maybe multiply some of the numbers and then add or subtract others.\n\nFirst, let's list the numbers: 14, 78, 50, 49. All must be used once. Let's see. 78 is a big number. If I can multiply 78 by something. But 78 multiplied by 2 is 156, which is still less than 191. 78*2.5 is 195, but I don't have a 2.5. Wait, maybe combine 50 and 49 somehow. 50 +49 is 99. If I subtract that from 78, that's 78 -99= -21, which isn't helpful. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, 78 plus 50 is 128. Then adding 49 gives 177, and then 14 would make it 191. Wait, 78 +50=128; 128 +49=177; 177 +14=191. But wait, that uses all four numbers with addition, but that's 78+50+49+14=191. Let me check the sum: 78+50 is 128, plus 49 is 177, plus 14 is 191. Oh! Wait, that's just adding all of them. So 78 + 50 + 49 +14 = 191. But wait, let me check the arithmetic again. 78+50 is 128. 128+49 is 177. 177+14 is 191. Yes. So that would be the equation. But wait, the problem says \"create an equation that equals 191\" using each number once and all operations. Wait, but if you can just add them all, that's straightforward. But maybe there's a trick here. Let me verify the sum again.\n\n14 +78 is 92, 50+49 is 99. 92+99=191. Yes. So adding all four numbers gives exactly 191. So the equation is 14 +78 +50 +49 =191. But wait, the problem says \"using basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) one or multiple times\", but the example given uses parentheses. So perhaps the user expects a combination of operations, but if adding all numbers works, then that's the answer. Let me check again if that's correct.\n\nYes, 14 +78 is 92, 50+49 is 99. 92 +99 =191. So yes, that's correct. Therefore, the equation is simply 14 +78 +50 +49 =191. But I need to present it as an equation with the numbers used once and operations. So the answer would be 14 +78 +50 +49. But maybe the user wants an equation with operations, not just addition. Wait, but addition is allowed. The example given was (1 + 2)/3, which uses addition and division. But if the sum works, then that's acceptable.\n\nWait, but perhaps the numbers are required to be used in an equation that combines them with different operations, but according to the problem statement, if adding them all works, then that's okay.

Hmm, let's start by thinking about possible combinations.\n\nFirst, 498 is a big number, so maybe I can use it as a starting point. If I subtract something from 498, maybe that will get me closer to 398. Let's see, 498 minus something equals 398. The difference between them is 100. So if I can make 100 using 10, 15, and 66, that would work. Let's see.\n\nWait, 10, 15, 66. How can I make 100 from these? Let's try some combinations. Maybe 66 plus 15 is 81, plus 10 is 91. Not enough. 15 multiplied by something. 15*6 is 90, but I don't have a 6. Wait, 66 divided by 10 is 6.6. Then 15*6.6 is 99. Then 498 - 99 is 399. Close, but not 398. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, 66 divided by something. Let's think. Maybe 66 - 15 is 51, then 51 + 10 is 61. 498 - 61 is 437. Not helpful.\n\nWhat if I use division in another way. For example, 498 divided by something? 498 divided by 15 is 33.2, which might not be helpful. 498 divided by 66 is around 7.545. Not sure. Maybe 10*15 is 150. Then 498 - 150 = 348. Then using 66, maybe 348 + 66 = 414. Not 398. Or 348 - 66 = 282. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 66 * 10 is 660. Then subtract 15: 660 -15 = 645. 498 is part of that, but 645 - 498 = 147. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe I need to use multiplication or division with 66 and 15. Let's see. 66 - 15 = 51. 51*10=510. 510 - 498=12. Not helpful.\n\nHow about 15*10=150. Then 498 - 150=348. Then 348 +66=414. Not 398. Alternatively, 498 - (15*10 +66) = 498 - (150+66)= 498-216=282. No.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 66*15=990. Then 990 divided by 10 is 99. Then 498 -99=399. Again, close but not 398. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe there's a way to subtract 1 more. But how? Because the numbers are fixed. Alternatively, maybe combine operations differently. For example, 15 divided by 10 is 1.5. Then 66 -1.5=64.5. Then 498 -64.5=433.5. No.\n\nAlternatively, 66 divided by 15 is 4.4. Then 10*4.4=44. 498 -44=454. Not helpful.\n\nHmm. Maybe I need to use a different approach. Let's consider that 398 is 400 - 2. How can I get 400 using some numbers and then subtract 2? But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe 398 = 498 - (something). Let's think again.\n\nWait, 498 - (66 +15 +10) = 498 -91=407. Not 398. Still 9 off.\n\nAlternatively, can I get 100 from 15, 66, and 10? Because 498 -100=398. Let's try:\n\n66 + (15*10) = 66 + 150 = 216. No. Wait, 15*10 is 150. Then 150 - 66=84. 84 is not 100. Hmm.\n\nWait, 15*6.666 is 100. But how to get 6.666 from 66 and 10. 66 divided by 10 is 6.6. So 15*(66/10) = 15*6.6=99. So 498 -99=399. Again, close. But how to get that 1 more?\n\nAlternatively, maybe subtract something else. Let's see. What if instead of 15*(66/10), maybe 15*(something else). For example, (66 -10)=56. Then 15*56=840. Then 840 -498=342. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe combining 66 and 15 in a different way. 66 -15=51. 51*10=510. Then 510 -498=12. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 15 +10=25. 66 -25=41. 498 -41=457. No.\n\nHmm. Maybe multiplication and division with other numbers. Let's think: 498 divided by 10 is 49.8. Then 66 - 49.8=16.2. Then 15*16.2=243. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 66 * (15 -10) =66*5=330. Then 498 -330=168. Not 398.\n\nWait, maybe 498 - (66 * (15 -10))= 498 - 330=168. No.\n\nAlternatively, 66 * 10=660. 660 -15=645. 645 -498=147. Still not helpful.\n\nWhat if I use division. 498 /15=33.2. Then 33.2 *10=332. Then 332 +66=398. Wait, that's possible. Let's check:\n\nBut here, I would have to use 498 divided by 15, then multiplied by 10, then plus 66. But that uses 498, 15, 10, and 66. Each once. So that would be 498 /15 *10 +66.\n\nLet me compute that step by step:\n\n498 /15 = 33.2\n\n33.2 *10=332\n\n332 +66=398. Yes! That works.\n\nSo the equation is (498 / 15) * 10 +66= 398.\n\nBut wait, let's make sure each number is used once. 498, 15, 10, 66. Yes, all used once. And the operations are division, multiplication, and addition. That fits the requirements. So the equation would be 498 / 15 * 10 +66 = 398. But according to the order of operations, division and multiplication have the same precedence and are done left to right, so that's correct. Alternatively, maybe parentheses can be added for clarity, but they aren't necessary. The problem allows any basic operations as long as each number is used once. So this equation works.\n</think>\n\n<answer>498 / 15 * 10 + 66 = 398</answer>"}]}

Each number can only be used once, and I can use the basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Hmm, where to start?\n\nFirst, maybe I should try combining some of these numbers and see what happens. Let's list them: 159, 57, 92, 87. They're all different, so I can't reuse any. The target is 97, which is a bit less than 100. Maybe subtracting numbers could help get close to that.\n\nLet me try some combinations. Let's see, 159 is the largest number here. If I subtract something from it, maybe I can get closer. For example, 159 minus 57 is 102. That's close to 97 but still 5 off. Hmm, 102 minus 5 would be 97, but how do I get 5 from the remaining numbers, 92 and 87? Wait, I can't use 57 again because I already used it. Wait, maybe I need a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use division or multiplication. Let's see. If I take 159 divided by something. 159 divided by 57 is approximately 2.789. Not sure if that helps. What if I do 159 - 57 = 102, then subtract 5? Wait, but how to get 5 from 92 and 87. Maybe 92 - 87 = 5. Oh! So 159 - 57 - (92 - 87) = 102 - 5 = 97. Wait, does that use all numbers? Let's check: 159, 57, 92, 87. Yes, each is used once. So that could be: 159 - 57 - (92 - 87) = 97. Let me verify the calculation: 159 -57 is 102. Then 92 -87 is 5. So 102 -5 is indeed 97. That works!\n\nWait, but let me check again. The equation would be 159 - 57 - (92 - 87) = 97. Yes, all numbers are used once. Let me make sure that the operations are correct. 159 minus 57 is 102. Then subtract the result of 92 minus 87, which is 5. So 102 minus 5 is 97. Perfect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way, but this seems to work. Let me see if there's another possible equation, just to be thorough. For example, maybe using multiplication. Let's see. If I multiply 57 and 87, that's way too big. Maybe 57 divided by something. 57 divided by 87 is like 0.655, which might not help. 92 divided by something? 92/57 is around 1.614. Hmm. Not sure. Maybe adding 92 and 87 gives 179, but then 179 minus 159 is 20, and 20 plus 57 is 77. Not helpful.\n\nAnother approach: 159 - 92 = 67. Then 67 plus 57 is 124. Then 124 minus 87 is 37. Nope. Not 97. How about 87 + 57 = 144. 159 - 144 = 15. 15 + 92 = 107. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 92 - 57 = 35. Then 159 - 35 = 124. 124 -87=37. No. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe grouping differently. Let's try (159 + 57) = 216. Then 216 - 92 = 124. 124 -87=37. Not 97. Hmm.\n\nWhat if we do 159 - (57 + 92 +87)? Let's see: 57+92=149, 149+87=236. 159-236 is -77. No. Not helpful.\n\nAnother idea: (87 - 57) = 30. Then 92 +30=122. 159 -122=37. Still no.\n\nWait, maybe division. Let's see, 159 divided by 57 is approximately 2.789. If we then multiply by 92, that's about 256. Then subtract 87: 256-87=169. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 92 divided by something. 92 divided by (87-57)=30. So 92/30≈3.066. Then 159 - 3.066≈155.933. Not close.\n\nAlternatively, 159 - (57 + (92/87)). Let's compute 92/87≈1.057. Then 57+1.057≈58.057. 159 -58.057≈100.943. Close to 97 but not exact.\n\nHmm. So maybe the first idea was the right one. Let me confirm again: 159 -57=102. Then 92-87=5. 102-5=97. So the equation is 159 - 57 - (92 - 87) = 97. Yes, that uses all four numbers once each with the operations. So that should be the correct answer.\n</think>\n\n<answer>159 - 57 - (92 - 87) = 97</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using all the numbers 72, 94, 586, and 49 exactly once, with basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) to reach 801. Hmm, that's a bit tricky. Let me start by thinking about the target number, 801. It's a little over 800, so maybe multiplying some of the larger numbers could get close. Let's list the numbers again: 72, 94, 586, 49.\n\nFirst, the largest number here is 586. If I can use that in a way that gets me close to 801, maybe subtract something from it or add to it. Let's see: 586 + something. Let's see what's left. 72, 94, 49. If I add 72 and 94, that's 166. 586 + 166 is 752. Then adding 49 would be 801. Wait, 586 + 72 + 94 + 49 = 586 + 72 is 658, plus 94 is 752, plus 49 is 801. Wait, that's actually exactly 801. Wait, but that's using all the numbers with addition. Let me check again: 586 +72=658, +94=752, +49=801. Yes! So the equation would be 586 + 72 + 94 + 49 = 801. But wait, does that use all the numbers once each? Let's see: 586, 72, 94, 49. Yes, all four numbers are used once. And the operations are all additions. So that's a valid equation. But wait, the problem didn't say that you have to use all the operations, just that you can use them. So if addition alone works, that's okay. Let me verify the arithmetic again to be sure.\n\n586 +72: 586 +70 is 656, plus 2 is 658. Then +94: 658 +90=748, +4=752. Then +49: 752 +40=792, +9=801. Yes, that's correct. So the equation would be 586 + 72 + 94 + 49 = 801. But wait, the problem says \"create an equation that equals 801\" using each number once and all the numbers. So maybe that's the answer. But let me check if there's any catch here. The problem allows using operations one or multiple times, and each number can be used only once. So adding them all up is allowed. So maybe that's the solution. But maybe the problem expects using different operations, but the problem statement doesn't say that. So perhaps that's the correct answer. Let me see if there's another way, just to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using multiplication or division could help. For example, 94 is a large number. If I multiply 94 by, say, 9, but I don't have 9. Wait, maybe 94 * 8. But I don't have 8. Alternatively, 586 divided by something. Let's see: 586 divided by 72 is roughly 8.138, which doesn't seem helpful. Hmm. Another approach: 94 * 49 is 4606, which is way too big. 72 * 94 is 6768, way too big. Maybe subtract something. For example, 586 + (94 * something). Let's see: 801 - 586 = 215. So if I can get 215 from 94, 72, 49. Let's see. 72 + 49 = 121, 121 + 94 = 215. So that's 72 + 49 +94 = 215. Then 586 +215=801. So that's the same as before. So the equation is 586 + 72 + 94 +49 = 801. So that's the same as just adding all of them. So maybe that's the answer. But I'm wondering if the problem expects something more complex. The user might have thought that it's too straightforward. But according to the problem statement, adding all numbers is allowed. Let me check again if the sum is indeed 801.\n\nAdding 586 +72: 658. Then +94: 658 +94=752. Then +49: 752+49=801. Yes. So the equation is correct. So the answer should be 586 + 72 + 94 + 49 = 801. But the example given in the problem uses parentheses, but in this case, addition is associative, so parentheses aren't necessary. So maybe just write it as (586 + 72) + (94 + 49) or any grouping, but the simplest way is to add them all. So the answer would be in the tags as <answer>586 + 72 + 94 + 49</answer>.\n</think>\n\n<answer>586 + 72 + 94 + 49</answer>"}]}

I need to use all the numbers 91, 95, 36, and 36 exactly once each, along with basic arithmetic operations, to make 186. Hmm. Let me start by thinking about possible combinations.\n\nFirst, 186 is a bit less than 200, so maybe combining the larger numbers first. Let's look at 95 and 91. If I add them together, that's 95 + 91 = 186. Wait, that's already 186! But then I have the two 36s left, and I have to use all numbers. Oh, but I can't just leave them out. So that approach doesn't work. Maybe I need to involve all four numbers somehow.\n\nAnother thought: maybe subtract or divide some numbers to get closer. Let's try 95 - 91. That gives 4. Then, if I use the 36s, maybe 36 + 36 = 72. Then 4 + 72 = 76. Not 186. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe multiply some numbers. 95 multiplied by 2 is 190, but how to get 2? We have two 36s. Maybe 36 divided by 36 is 1, but that's 1. Then 95 * 1 =95, plus 91 is 186. Wait, that might work! Let me check:\n\n95 * (36 / 36) + 91. So 36 divided by 36 is 1, multiplied by 95 is 95, plus 91 is 95 + 91 = 186. But wait, does that use all numbers? Yes: 95, 36, 36, and 91. Each is used once. Oh, but 36 is used twice here. Wait, the problem states that each number can be used once. Oh, right, the two 36s are separate numbers. So in this case, using both 36s as (36/36) is allowed because we're using each 36 once. So that works. Let me verify:\n\n95 * (36 ÷ 36) + 91 = 95 * 1 + 91 = 95 + 91 = 186. Yes! That seems to fit. So the equation would be 95 * (36 / 36) + 91 = 186. But let me check if there's another way, just to be sure.\n\nAnother approach: maybe subtract something. 95 + 91 = 186, but then how do I include the two 36s? If I do 95 + 91 + 36 - 36, that would be 186 + 0 = 186. But here, both 36s are used, once added and once subtracted. So that's 95 + 91 + 36 - 36 = 186. That also uses all four numbers. Each 36 is used once. So that's another possible equation.\n\nWait, but in this case, adding and subtracting the same number. So technically, that's valid. So both solutions are possible. Let me check if the problem allows using subtraction in that way. The problem says we can use each arithmetic operation multiple times, and each number once. So both solutions are valid. However, perhaps the first one is more straightforward.\n\nBut let me check if the problem has any restrictions. The user didn't mention that operations can't be combined in certain ways, so both equations are acceptable. Hmm. So which one to choose? The user might prefer one over the other. Let me check both.\n\nFirst solution: 95 * (36 / 36) + 91 = 186. Second solution: 95 + 91 + 36 - 36 = 186. Both are correct. But maybe the second is simpler. Alternatively, the problem might prefer not to have a subtraction of the same number added. Let me see.\n\nWait, the problem says \"create an equation that equals 186\" using all numbers once. So either approach works. But maybe the first one uses multiplication and division, which might be more interesting. Alternatively, the second one is just addition and subtraction. Either way, both are valid. But since the user might expect a more creative use of operations, the first one might be better. Let me confirm.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: 95 + (91 - 36/36). Let's compute that: 95 + (91 -1) = 95 +90=185. Close, but not 186. Not quite. What if 95 + 91 + (36/36) = 95+91+1=187. Still not. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, 95 * (36 + 36) / something. Let's see: 95 * (72) = 6840. Then divide by 91? 6840 /91 is approximately 75.16. Not helpful. Alternatively, 95 * 36 / (something). Let's try 95 * 36 = 3420. Then 3420 divided by (91 -36) = 3420 /55=62.18. No. Not helpful.\n\nAnother idea: 36 * 5 = 180, but how to get 5? 95 divided by 19 is 5, but where's 19 from? Alternatively, 91 - 36 =55. Then 95 -55=40. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe 36 * (95 - 91) + 36. Let's see: 36*(4) +36= 144 +36=180. Close. But not 186. If it's 36*(5) +6=180+6=186. How to get 5 and 6? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, 95 + 91 = 186. Then, if I subtract 36 and add 36, that's the same as before. So 95 +91 +36 -36=186. So that's the same as the second solution. So that's a valid equation.\n\nSo both solutions are valid. Let me check if the problem allows for parentheses. The example given was (1 +2)/3, so parentheses are allowed. So both equations would be acceptable. However, maybe the user expects one equation. Let me see.\n\nThe user might prefer the equation that uses all operations, but since addition and subtraction are basic, perhaps the second one is acceptable. But the first one uses multiplication and division as well. Either way, either answer is correct. But I need to choose one.\n\nWait, the problem says \"create an equation that equals 186. You can use basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) one or multiple times but each number can only be used once, and you must use all the numbers.\"\n\nSo both equations are correct. Let me think if the user would prefer one over the other. The second equation is simpler: 95 + 91 +36 -36=186. But perhaps the user expects more operations. Alternatively, the first equation uses multiplication and division, which is also good. Either way, both are correct. Maybe the first one is more creative. Let me go with the first one: 95*(36/36)+91=186. Because it uses all four numbers and a mix of operations. Alternatively, the second one is also correct. Hmm. I need to make sure which one is correct.\n\nWait, let me check the arithmetic again. For the first equation: 36 divided by 36 is 1. 95 times 1 is 95. 95 plus 91 is 186. Correct. The second equation: 95 +91 is 186, then +36 -36 cancels out. So 186 remains. So that's also correct. Both equations use all four numbers once. So both are valid. But perhaps the user wants the simplest answer, which is the second one. Alternatively, maybe the first one is more interesting. \n\nBut since the problem allows any combination, I'll present both possibilities, but according to the instructions, I need to provide the final equation in the answer tags. Since the user might accept either, but perhaps the first one uses more operations. Let me check the problem again. It says \"using the numbers 91, 95, 36, 36\" – since there are two 36s, perhaps the equation that uses them in a division (36/36) is intended. So I'll go with that one.\n</think>\n\n<answer>95 * (36 / 36) + 91 = 186</answer>"}]}

Let's see.\n\nFirst, 747 is the biggest number. If I subtract something from 747, maybe that gets me closer. 747 minus what? Let's see: 747 - 33 = 714, which is too low. 747 - 32 = 715. Still not there. If I add instead: 747 + 88 = 835. Oh, that's very close to 834. Wait, 835 is just one more than 834. Hmm. So maybe 747 + 88 = 835, but I need to subtract 1. But how to get 1 from the remaining numbers 33 and 32. 33 - 32 is 1. So maybe combining all that: 747 + 88 - (33 - 32) = 747 + 88 -1 = 834. Let me check that. 747 +88 is 835, then subtract (33-32)=1, so 835-1=834. That works! But let me verify if all numbers are used once. Yes: 747, 88, 33, 32. All used. The operations are addition, subtraction, and the parentheses. So the equation would be 747 + 88 - (33 - 32) = 834. That should be correct.\n</think>\n\n<answer>747 + 88 - (33 - 32) = 834</answer>"}]}

The operations allowed are +, -, *, /, and each number must be used exactly once. Alright, let's start by thinking about how these numbers can combine.\n\nFirst, 976 is a pretty large number, so maybe multiplication is involved here. Let me check the biggest numbers first. The largest numbers here are 68 and 61. If I multiply those two, 68 * 61 = 4148, which is way too big. So that's not helpful. Maybe subtract them? 68 - 61 = 7, but that seems too small. What if I add them? 68 + 61 = 129. Still not close. Maybe divide? 68 / 61 is about 1.11, which doesn't help. So maybe those two aren't the key here.\n\nNext, let's look at 17 and 4. 17 * 4 = 68. Oh, wait, but we already have a 68. So maybe combining 17 and 4 to get another 68? But since we can only use each number once, that might not be allowed. Wait, the problem says each number can be used once. So if I use 17 and 4 to make 68, that's two numbers used, but then I can't use the existing 68. So that approach probably isn't valid. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can combine 68 with another number. Let's see. 68 * 17 = 1156. Then subtract something. 1156 - 61 = 1095. Still too big. Then subtract 4? 1095 -4=1091. Not helpful. Or maybe 68*17 is 1156. Then 1156 - (61*4) = 1156 -244=912. Not 976. Alternatively, 68*17 + something. 1156 + ... but the remaining numbers are 61 and 4. 61*4=244. 1156+244=1400. Too big. \n\nWait, 61*17 is 1037. Then maybe 1037 - 68 = 969. Close to 976, but still 7 off. Then subtract 4? 969 -4=965. Not helpful. Alternatively, 61*17=1037, plus 68 is 1105, minus 4 is 1101. Still no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe multiply 61 and 4 first. 61*4=244. Then 244*4=976. Wait, but I can only use 4 once. So that's not allowed. Oh right, 4 is only used once. So 61*4=244, then maybe 244 multiplied by something else. Let's see, 244*4 would require another 4, which I don't have. So maybe 244*(something). The remaining numbers are 68 and 17. 68 -17=51. 244*51 is way too big. Hmm.\n\nWait, the target is 976. Let's factor 976. Let's divide it by some of the numbers here. 976 divided by 68 is 14.3529... not an integer. Divided by 61 is 16. So 61*16=976. But how to get 16 from the remaining numbers: 4, 68, 17. Wait, 17 - (68 / 4). Let's calculate that: 68 divided by 4 is 17. So 17 -17=0. That's no good. Alternatively, 4 + 17=21. Not 16. Hmm. Maybe 68 divided by 4 is 17. Then 17 + 17=34. Still not 16. \n\nWait, maybe 68 - 17 =51. 51 divided by something? 51/4=12.75. Not helpful. Alternatively, 17 -4=13. 61*13=793. Then 793 +68=861. Not 976. \n\nAlternatively, 61*(17 + (68/4)). Let's compute 68/4=17. So 17+17=34. 61*34=2074. That's way over. \n\nAlternatively, maybe 68*(17 -4). 17-4=13. 68*13=884. Then 884 +61=945, still not 976. 945 +17? But we already used 17. No. \n\nWait, maybe 68*17=1156. Then 1156 - 61* (something). Let's see. 61*3=183. 1156-183=973. Close to 976, but we need 3 more. But we have 4 left. 973 +4=977. Off by 1. Not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, 68*14=952. Then 952 + 17=969. Then +4=973. Still not. \n\nAlternatively, 61*16=976. Let's see if we can get 16. The remaining numbers are 68,17,4. How to make 16 with those? 68/(17 -4). 17-4=13. 68/13≈5.23. Not 16. Alternatively, (68 - 17) -4=47. Not 16. Alternatively, 17 - (68/4). 68/4=17, so 17-17=0. No.\n\nHmm. Maybe another approach. Let's try adding and multiplying in different combinations. For example, 4*68=272. Then 272* something. The remaining numbers are 61 and 17. 272*3.5=952. But 61/17≈3.588. So 272*(61/17)=272*(3.588)≈975. That's very close to 976. Let me compute that exactly. 61 divided by 17 is 61/17. 272*(61/17) = (272/17)*61 = 16*61=976. Oh! Wait a minute! That works. Let me check:\n\nSo 4 * 68 = 272. Then 272 divided by 17 is 16. Then 16 multiplied by 61 is 976. So putting that together: (4 * 68 / 17) * 61 = 976. Let's check step by step:\n\n4 * 68 = 272\n\n272 / 17 = 16\n\n16 * 61 = 976\n\nYes! So that uses all numbers: 4, 68, 17, and 61. Each exactly once, and the operations are * , / , *. So the equation would be (4 * 68 / 17) * 61 = 976. But since we have to use all numbers once, and in the equation, each is used once. Wait, but the way to write the equation without parentheses might be possible. Let me see: 4 * 68 / 17 * 61. Since multiplication and division are left to right. So 4*68=272, 272/17=16, 16*61=976. So yes, that works. Therefore, the equation is 4 * 68 / 17 * 61 = 976. Wait, but the problem allows using operations multiple times, so that's acceptable. Let me confirm all numbers are used once: 4, 68, 17, 61. Yes, all used once. Perfect.\n</think>\n\n<answer>4 * 68 / 17 * 61 = 976</answer>"}]}

The biggest number here is 98. If I can multiply 98 by something close to 2, that would be 196, which is a bit over. But 164 is less than that. Alternatively, maybe subtract something from 98. Let's see. 98 + something? If I add 37 and 34, that's 71. 98 + 71 is 169. Close, but 5 left. Wait, but I have to use all numbers. Hmm.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe multiply two numbers. 98 is the largest. Let's see, 98 multiplied by 2 is 196. If I can get 2 from the other numbers. But we have 5, 34, and 37 left. Wait, 34 divided by 17 is 2, but 17 isn't here. Alternatively, 5 minus (37-34) is 5 - 3 = 2. Then 98*2=196. Then subtract 32? But how to get 32 from the remaining numbers. Wait, not sure. Maybe that's not the right path.\n\nWait, let's list all the numbers: 37, 98, 5, 34. All must be used once. So maybe group them into two pairs. For example, (98 - 34) is 64. Then maybe 64 * something? 64 * 2.5625 is 164, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, 98 - (something) = 164? But 98 is less than 164. Maybe addition first. 98 + 37 = 135. Then we have 5 and 34 left. 135 + 34 = 169, then subtract 5 gives 164. Wait, that's possible. Let me check:\n\n98 + 37 = 135. Then 135 + 34 = 169. Then 169 -5 = 164. But does that use all numbers? Yes: 98,37,34,5. So the equation would be 98 + 37 + 34 - 5. Let me calculate that: 98+37=135, 135+34=169, 169-5=164. Yep, that works. So that's the equation. Let me just verify all numbers are used once and only once. 98,37,34,5: yes. All four numbers are used. Operations are +, +, -, which are allowed. So that seems to fit.\n</think>\n\n<answer>98 + 37 + 34 - 5 = 164</answer>"}]}

Hmm. 343 is 7 cubed, so maybe that's a hint? But how do I get 7 from those numbers? Let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, let me list out the numbers I have: 54, 22, 89, 14. All need to be used. Maybe I can combine some of them to get close to 343. Let me try some combinations.\n\nLet's start with the largest number, 89. If I subtract something from 89, maybe I can get part of the way. For example, 89 - 54 = 35. Then 35 * something... but 35*10 is 350, which is close but not 343. But I don't have a 10. Alternatively, 89 + 54 = 143.

And all numbers are used once: 22,14,89,54. That seems to fit. Let me double-check:\n\n22*14 = 308. 89-54=35. 308+35=343. Yes. So the equation would be (22 × 14) + (89 − 54) = 343.

I need to create an equation using all the numbers 72, 82, 97, and 82 exactly once, and the result should be 169. The operations allowed are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Hmm. Let's start by thinking about how these numbers can combine.\n\nFirst, maybe I should look for pairs that can form numbers close to 169 when combined. Let's check the larger numbers first. The two 82s are the same, so maybe they can be used together. 97 is the biggest number here. If I subtract something from 97, maybe. But 97 - 82 is 15, which is way too small. What if I add 97 and 82? That would be 179. Hmm, 179 is 10 more than 169. Maybe I can adjust that. Wait, but I have to use all four numbers. So 179 would only use 97 and 82. Then I need to use 72 and the other 82. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe combine 72 and 97. 72 + 97 is 169. Oh, wait! That's exactly the target. But then I still have the two 82s left. How can I include them? Because I need to use all four numbers. If I have 72 + 97 = 169, but I also have to use both 82s. Hmm. So maybe I need to find a way to subtract or add the 82s in such a way that they cancel out or contribute to reaching 169.\n\nWait, another approach: Maybe combine the two 82s first. Since there are two of them, perhaps using subtraction or division. Let's see. 82 divided by 82 is 1. Then if I do 72 + 97 + 1, that's 170. Close, but not 169. Alternatively, 82 - 82 is 0. Then adding that to 72 +97 would still be 169, but then I'm not using the 0? Wait, but 72 +97 + (82 -82) = 72 +97 +0 = 169. Oh! That uses all four numbers. But does that work? Let me check: 72 +97 is 169. Then 82 -82 is 0. So adding those together: 169 +0 =169. Yes. So the equation would be (72 +97) + (82 -82) =169. But does that meet the requirements? Each number is used once, and all are used. Yes. But wait, maybe the parentheses are necessary? Let me verify. 72 +97 is 169, and 82-82 is 0. So adding them gives 169. So the equation would be 72 +97 +82 -82 =169. But since subtraction is left associative, that would be equivalent to (72 +97 +82) -82. Which is 72 +97 =169, then +82 is 251, then minus 82 is back to 169. So yes, 72 +97 +82 -82 =169. But the problem is, does the order of operations matter here? Alternatively, arranging as (72 +97) + (82 -82) =169. Both ways, the result is correct. So maybe that's the solution. Let me check again. Numbers used: 72, 97, 82, 82. All used once. Yes. Operations are addition and subtraction. So this works. Wait, but the problem says \"create an equation that equals 169\". So maybe this is the answer. Let me write it as 72 + 97 + 82 - 82 = 169. Or perhaps group differently for clarity. Either way, it uses all numbers and operations correctly. Alternatively, maybe there's another combination. Let me think if there's another way. For example, using multiplication or division. Let's see. Suppose I take 82 * 2 =164, but we have two 82s, but I can't use 2. Wait, perhaps 82 +82 =164. Then 164 + something equals 169. 164 +5=169. But where would the 5 come from? 72 and 97. Maybe 97 -72 =25. Then 164 + (97-72) =164+25=189. Not 169. Hmm. Alternatively, 97 - (72 / something). Let me think. 82 divided by something. If I do 97 - (72/(82/82)). Wait, 82 divided by 82 is 1. So 72 divided by 1 is 72. Then 97 -72=25. Then 82 +82 +25=189. Still not helpful. Alternatively, maybe 82 * (something). Let's see. For example, 82*(97-72)/82. Let's compute that: 97-72=25. So 82*25=2050. Then 2050/82=25. Then adding the remaining 82: 25 +82=107. Not 169. Hmm. Maybe that's not the right path. Another idea: (82 +82) =164. Then 164 +5=169. How to get 5? 97-72=25. Then 25 /5=5, but that would require using numbers more than once. Wait, but we have 72 and 97 left. 97-72=25. Then 25 divided by something. But we already used 82 and 82. Wait, perhaps 97 -72=25. Then 25 + (82+82) =25+164=189. Not helpful. Alternatively, 164 + (97 -72) =189. Not 169. Hmm. Maybe 82 * (something) minus another number. 82*2=164. 164 + (97 -72) =164+25=189. Not helpful. Hmm. Let's go back to the initial solution. The simplest way seems to be 72+97 +82-82. Because that uses all numbers. Let's confirm: 72 +97=169, then 82-82=0. So 169+0=169. So the equation is 72 +97 +82 -82 =169. Alternatively, written as (72 +97) + (82 -82) =169. Both are correct. Since all numbers are used once, and the operations are allowed. So that's the answer. Let me check if there's any other possible way. Suppose using division. For example, 82 divided by 82 is 1. Then 97 +72 =169. Then 169 *1=169. So 97 +72 + (82/82) =169 +1=170. No, that's 170. Wait, 97 +72 is 169. Then adding (82/82)=1 gives 170. Not helpful. Alternatively, 97 +72 - (82/82)=169 -1=168. Not 169. So that's not working. What if multiply 82 and 82? That's 6724. Then divide by something. 6724 divided by 72 is approximately 93.4. Then 97 minus that would be negative. Not helpful. Alternatively, 6724 divided by 97 is approximately 69.32. Then adding 72: 69.32 +72=141.32. Not close. Hmm. Alternatively, 97 *82=7954. Then subtract 72*82=5904. 7954-5904=2050. Then 2050 divided by the remaining number? But we already used all numbers. Wait, no. 97*82 uses 97 and 82, then 72*82 uses 72 and the other 82. That uses all four numbers. Then 7954 -5904=2050. 2050 divided by what? But there's no number left. That approach doesn't result in 169. So maybe that's not the way. Back to the initial idea. The simplest is 72 +97 +82 -82. Which is 72 +97 =169, then adding and subtracting the same number. So that seems to work. Let me check once again: 72 +97 is 169. Then 82 -82 is 0. Adding those gives 169. So the equation is correct.

I need to create an equation using the numbers 74, 98, 17, and 8 exactly once each, with basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) to get 693. Hmm, 693 is a pretty large number. Maybe multiplication is involved here. Let me start by looking at the numbers. The largest numbers are 98 and 74. If I multiply them, 98*74 is... let me calculate that. 98*70 is 6860, and 98*4 is 392, so total is 6860+392=7252. That's way too big. Hmm. Maybe subtract something? But 7252 minus something else would still be way over. So maybe that's not the right approach.\n\nWait, 693 divided by some number? Let me check. 693 divided by 9 is 77, but 9 isn't in the numbers. Wait, 693 divided by 7 is 99, but again 7 isn't here. Let's see. The factors of 693: 3*231, 7*99, 9*77, 11*63, 21*33. None of these factors are in the numbers given except maybe 21 (but 21 isn't here), 77 is close to 74 but not exactly. Maybe another approach.\n\nAlternatively, let's see if combining some numbers can get close. 98 minus 8 is 90. 90 times something. 90*7.7 is 693, but I don't have 7.7. Wait, 98-8=90. Then 90*7.7=693, but 7.7 is not here. Maybe using 74 and 17. Let's see. 74*9=666, which is close to 693. How to get 9? 17-8=9. So 74*(17-8)=74*9=666. Then 666 is less than 693 by 27. But I have 98 left. Wait, how? Because if I used 74, 17, 8, then 98 is left. So maybe 666 + 98 = 764, which is over. Or 98 - something? 98- (something). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (98 + 74) * something. 98+74=172. 172*4=688, which is close to 693. 688 is 5 less than 693. Then, 4 is 8/2, but I don't have a 2. Hmm. Alternatively, 172* (something else). Wait, maybe 172* (17 - something). Let me check. 172*4=688, but how to get 4? 8/2, but no 2. Alternatively, 17-8=9. 172*9=1548, which is way too big. Not helpful.\n\nAnother idea: 98 divided by something. 98/8 is 12.25. Then 12.25*74=12.25*70=857.5 +12.25*4=49, total 906.5. Not useful. Alternatively, 74/8=9.25. 9.25*98= 9.25*100=925 - 9.25*2=18.5, so 925-18.5=906.5. Still not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe subtract two products. Let's see. 98*8=784. 17*74=1258. Wait, 1258-784=474. Not close. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, 98*7=686, which is close to 693. But how to get 7? Maybe using 17 and 8. 17-8=9. Not 7. Or (17-8- something). Wait, but all numbers must be used once. So maybe 98*7 + something. Not helpful.\n\nWait, 17*8=136. If I do 74*98=7252. Then subtract 17*8=136. 7252-136=7116. Way too big. Not helpful.\n\nAnother approach: 693 divided by 17 is approximately 40.76. Hmm. Maybe 40.76 can be formed with the remaining numbers. 74 and 98 and 8. Let's see. 74 - 98/8. 98 divided by 8 is 12.25. 74 -12.25=61.75. Then 61.75*17= 61.75*10=617.5 +61.75*7=432.25 = total 1049.75. Not 693. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe 98*7. Let's see. 98*7=686. Then 686 +7=693. But where do I get 7? Maybe from 17-8-2, but no 2. Not possible. Alternatively, 98* (8 - (17/74)). That's complicated. Let me compute that: 17/74 is approx 0.2297. 8 -0.2297=7.7703. 98*7.7703≈761.89. Not close.\n\nAlternatively, 74*(98 -17) -8. Let's compute 98-17=81. 74*81= 74*80=5920 +74=5994. Then subtract 8: 5986. Way too big.\n\nHmm. Maybe (98 +74) * (17 -8). 17-8=9. 98+74=172. 172*9=1548. No.\n\nWait, 693 is 700-7. Maybe 700-7. How to get 700 from some numbers. 74*9=666, then 666 +34=700. 34 can be 98 - (something). Wait, 98 - (17+8)=73. So 98-17-8=73. Then 74*9 +73=666+73=739. Not 700. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 98*7=686. Then 686 +7=693. But how to get the 7? 17-8=9. 9-2=7. But where's the 2? Not possible. Or 74 divided by something. 74 divided by 8 is 9.25. Not helpful.\n\nWait another angle: 17*40=680. 680+13=693. How to get 40 and 13. 40 from 74-34. 34 from 98-64. Not sure. This might be too convoluted.\n\nAlternatively, let's see if we can use division in a way that combines numbers. For example, 98 divided by 8 is 12.25. Then 12.25*17=208.25. Then 208.25 +74=282.25. No. Not 693.\n\nHmm. What if we do 17*8=136. Then 74*136=10064. That's way too big. Maybe divide 74 by something. 74/8=9.25. 9.25*17=157.25. 157.25*98=15410.5. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe 98*(74 -17) -8. Let's compute 74-17=57. 98*57= 98*50=4900 +98*7=686 → 5586. 5586 -8=5578. No.\n\nAlternatively, 98*(74 - (17+8)). 17+8=25. 74-25=49. 98*49=4802. No.\n\nWait, 98*7=686, which is 7 less than 693. If we can get 7 from the remaining numbers. But we have 74,17,8 left. 17- (something)=7. 17-10=7. How to get 10 from 74 and 8? 74-8=66. Not 10. 74/8=9.25. 17-9.25=7.75. Close, but not exact. 98*(74/8) + (17 - (74/8))? Let me compute that. 74/8=9.25. 98*9.25= 906.5. Then 17-9.25=7.75. 906.5 +7.75=914.25. Not 693.\n\nThis is tricky. Maybe another approach: 693 is 700 -7. Let's see if we can make 700 and 7. 700 can be made with 98*7, but again, 7 is not available. Alternatively, 74*9.36=693, but 9.36 isn't straightforward.\n\nWait, here's an idea. 693 divided by 17 is 40.7647. Hmm, maybe 40.7647 can be formed by other numbers. Let me try. Suppose (74 + 98 -8)/ something. 74+98=172. 172-8=164. 164 divided by something to get around 40.76. 164/4=41. 41 is close. 4 can be 17 -13, but 13 is not here. Alternatively, 8/(something). Wait, but I need to use all numbers. Hmm. Alternatively, 98 - (17 +8)=73. 73*74= 5402. No.\n\nWait, 98 - 8 =90. 90*7.7=693. So 7.7 is needed. How to get 7.7 from 74 and 17. 74/17≈4.3529. Not helpful. Or 17/74≈0.229. Hmm. 90*(74/17 + something). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, 98*(something) -74/(something). Let's try. Maybe 98*7 -74/17. 98*7=686. 74/17≈4.3529. 686-4.3529≈681.647. Not 693.\n\nWait, 98*7=686. Then add 7 to get 693. So 98*7 +7=693. But where to get the 7? Using 17-8- something. 17-8=9. 9-2=7. But no 2 here. Alternatively, 17/(8 - something). But again, missing numbers.\n\nWait, another angle: 17*8=136. Then 136*5=680. 680 +13=693. But where to get 5 and 13? 5 could be 74 -69, but not helpful. Maybe not.\n\nHmm. Maybe combine multiplication and division. Let's try (98 +74) * (17 -8). Wait, that's 172*9=1548. No. Not helpful.\n\nWait, 74*17=1258. Then subtract 98*8=784. 1258-784=474. Not close.\n\nAlternatively, 98*17=1666. Then 1666 - (74*8)=1666-592=1074. Not 693.\n\nHmm. Let's check if 693 can be achieved through division. 693 = (something)/(something else). For example, 1386/2=693. But 1386 can be 74*19. So 74*19=1406, which is too big. Not helpful.\n\nWait, 8*98=784. 784 - 74=710. 710 -17=693. Wait, wait! Let me check this:\n\n8*98=784. Then 784 -74=710. Then 710 -17=693. But have I used all numbers? Let's see: 8,98,74,17. Yes, all four. And all used once. The operations are * , -, -.\n\nSo the equation would be 8*98 -74 -17=693. Let's verify:\n\n8*98=784. 784-74=710. 710-17=693. Yes! That works. So the equation is 8*98 -74 -17 =693.\n</think>\n\n<answer>8 * 98 - 74 - 17 = 693</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using the numbers 4, 66, 42, and 24, each exactly once, and the result should be 44. The operations allowed are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Hmm, where to start.\n\nFirst, maybe I should look at the target number, 44, and see how it relates to the given numbers. Let me check the numbers again: 4, 66, 42, 24. 44 is close to 42 but a bit higher. Also, 66 minus 24 is 42, which is one of the numbers here. Wait, but I have to use all numbers. Let's think of possible combinations.\n\nLet me try combining 66 and 24 first. 66 - 24 equals 42, but then I already have 42 as a separate number. Wait, but maybe I can use that. So if I do 66 - 24 = 42, then maybe subtract the 42 from that? But that would be 42 - 42 = 0, which isn't helpful. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe I can use division or multiplication.\n\nAnother approach: Let's see if 66 divided by something gives a number that can be adjusted to reach 44. 66 divided by 1.5 is 44, but how can I get 1.5 using the other numbers? The other numbers are 4, 42, 24. Maybe 42 divided by 24 is 1.75. Not quite. 24 divided by 4 is 6. 42 divided by 4 is 10.5. Hmm.\n\nWait, 66 divided by (something) equals 44. Solving for that something: 66 / x =44 → x=66/44=1.5. So I need to make 1.5 using 4, 42, and 24. But how? Let's see. 42 divided by (24 + 4) would be 42 /28 =1.5. Wait, that could work. So 66 divided by (42 / (24 + 4)) equals 44. Let me check: 24 +4=28, 42/28=1.5, 66/1.5=44. That seems right. But wait, are we allowed to use parentheses like that? Let me verify the operations:\n\nSo equation would be 66 ÷ (42 ÷ (24 + 4)) = 44. Let's break it down:\n\nFirst, 24 +4 =28. Then 42 divided by 28 is 1.5. Then 66 divided by 1.5 is 44. Yes, that works. And all numbers are used once: 66, 42, 24, 4. Each used exactly once. The operations are addition, division, and division again. So that should be acceptable.

I need to create an equation using the numbers 33, 39, 900, 87, each exactly once, and the result has to be 474. The operations allowed are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Hmm. Let's start by thinking about how these numbers can combine.\n\nFirst, 900 is a big number. Maybe that's key here. If I can use 900 in a way that gets close to 474, then adjust with the others. Let's see: 900 divided by something. 900 divided by 2 is 450, which is 24 less than 474. But 2 isn't one of the numbers. Alternatively, maybe subtracting something from 900. 900 minus 426 equals 474. How do I get 426 from the remaining numbers: 33, 39, 87. Let's see, 33 + 39 is 72, which is too small. 87 times something. 87*5 is 435, which is close. But 5 isn't a number here. Alternatively, maybe 87 + 39 = 126. 900 - 126 = 774, which is way over. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about multiplication or division with 900. For example, 900 / (something) equals part of the equation. Let's say 900 divided by 2 is 450, but again, 2 isn't available. If I use 33 and 39, maybe 33 + 39 = 72. 900 / 72 would be 12.5, which isn't helpful. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe subtract 900 by some combination. Let's think: 900 - (33 * something). 33*13 is 429. 900 - 429 = 471, which is 3 less than 474. But where would 3 come from? Wait, maybe 39 - 33 = 6. Then 900 - (something * 33) plus or minus that. Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe start with 87. 87 is a large number. If I subtract 87 from 900, that's 813. Then subtract more. 813 - 39 = 774, which is still way too high. Not helpful.\n\nLet me try a different approach. The target is 474. Let's see what numbers multiplied could get close. 39 * 12 is 468, which is 6 less than 474. 39*12.5 would be 487.5. Hmm. 33 * 14 is 462, which is 12 less. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 87 * 5.43 is around 474, but that's using decimals. But we have to use integers and exact operations. Let's think again.\n\nWait, 900 divided by something minus something else. Let's see, 900 divided by 2 is 450, as before, but 2 isn't here. But what if we can create 2 using the numbers. For example, 39 - 33 = 6. Then 900 / (39 - 33) = 900/6 = 150. Then 150 + 87 = 237, which is half of 474. So maybe multiply by 2? But 2 isn't a number here. Alternatively, maybe use the remaining number. Wait, if we do 900 / (39 - 33) + 87 * something. Wait, we have 87 and 39, 33, 900. Wait, if we use 39 - 33 = 6, then 900 / 6 = 150. Then, 150 + 87 = 237. But 237 is half of 474. But how to get the other 237. Maybe multiply by 2, but we don't have a 2. Hmm. Maybe use 87 and 39 in another way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (900 - (87 * something)) divided by something else. Let's try. 87 * 5 is 435. 900 - 435 = 465. Then 465 + 9 = 474. But where would 9 come from? 39 - 33 = 6, not 9. Hmm.\n\nWait, let's think about combining 87 and 39. 87 + 39 = 126. Then 900 - 126 = 774. 774 divided by something. If we divide 774 by 33, that's 23.45, not helpful. Alternatively, 774 - 33*9. But 9 isn't a number here.\n\nAlternatively, 87 * 39 is 3393. That's way too big. Maybe divide that by something. 3393 / 900 = 3.77. Not useful.\n\nWhat if we use subtraction and division. For example, 900 - (87 - 39) * 33. Let's compute that: 87 - 39 = 48. 48 * 33 = 1584. 900 - 1584 = -684. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe reverse the operations. (900 / 33) is approximately 27.27. 27.27 + 39 + 87 = 153.27. No. Not close.\n\nHmm. Maybe multiplication with 900 and then subtract. 900 * (something). But 900 is already a big number. Maybe 900 - (87 + 39 + 33) = 900 - 159 = 741. Not helpful.\n\nWait, let's think differently. The target is 474. Let's see 474 divided by 6 is 79. Maybe 79 can be achieved with other numbers. But how. 87 - 8 = 79. But 8 isn't here. Alternatively, 33 + 46 = 79. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, 474 = 39 * 12 + 6. Hmm. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 474 is 87 * 5 + 39. Let's see: 87*5=435. 435+39=474. But then we need to get 5 from 900 and 33. Wait, 900 divided by something. 900 / 180 =5. But 180 isn't here. 33*5=165. Not helpful.\n\nWait, if 87*5 is 435, then 435 +39=474. So that uses 87, 39. Then we have 900 and 33 left. How to get 5 from 900 and 33. Maybe 900 / (33*5.45), but that's not an integer. Alternatively, 33 - 28=5, but 28 is not available. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use 900 divided by 33. 900/33≈27.27. 27.27 * 17.33 ≈474. But that's using decimals and other numbers.\n\nThis is tricky. Let's try another angle. Let's list possible combinations. Since we have to use all numbers, perhaps 900 and 87 can be combined, then 33 and 39. For example, 900 - 87 = 813. Then 813 - (33*39). Wait, 33*39=1287. 813 -1287= negative number. Not useful.\n\nWait, maybe (900 - 87) / (something). 813 divided by, say, 33 + 39=72. 813/72≈11.29. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 900 divided by (87 - 33). 87-33=54. 900/54≈16.666. Then 16.666 * 39≈650, which is over 474. Not helpful.\n\nHmm. What if we do 39*33=1287. Then 1287 - 900=387. 387 +87=474. Wait, that works! Let's check:\n\n39 multiplied by 33 is 1287. Then subtract 900: 1287 -900=387. Then add 87: 387+87=474. But wait, that uses all numbers: 39, 33, 900, 87. Yes! So the equation would be (39 * 33) - 900 + 87 = 474. Let me verify:\n\n39*33=1287\n\n1287 -900=387\n\n387 +87=474. Yes! That's correct. So the equation is (39 * 33) - 900 + 87 = 474. Let me check if all numbers are used once: 39, 33, 900, 87. Yes. All used. Operations are multiplication, subtraction, and addition. Perfect.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(39 * 33) - 900 + 87 = 474</answer>"}]}

Let me start by thinking about the target number, 91. It's not too close to 99, but maybe if I subtract something from 99. Let's try 99 minus something equals 91. Then that something would need to be 8. Oh, wait, but I have two 53s. So maybe 99 - 8 = 91, but then I still have both 53s left, and I have to use them. That doesn't work. So that approach might not be right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe combine the 53s first. Since there are two 53s, maybe adding them: 53 + 53 = 106. Then subtract something from that. 106 - 15 = 91. But how do I get 15 using 99 and 8? Wait, I need to use all numbers. If I used 53+53 and then subtract, but 99 and 8 are still left. Hmm, maybe 53 + 53 - (99 / 8). Let's calculate that. 99 divided by 8 is 12.375. 53+53=106, minus 12.375 is 93.625, which is not 91. That's not close. Maybe that's not the way.\n\nWhat if I multiply 53 and 8? 53*8=424.

Let's see, 99-53=46. 424/46 is about 9.217. Not useful. \n\nAnother approach: 99 - (53 / (53 - 8)). Let's check denominator: 53-8=45. Then 53/45 ≈1.177. 99 minus that is around 97.823. Not 91. Close but not quite. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe using division in a different way. Let's think. If I have 99 and 53, maybe 99 - (53 + something) =91. Then 53 + something =8. But 8 is already one of the numbers, so that would require using 53 and 8, but then the other 53 is left. Wait, maybe 99 - (something) =91. Then that something is 8. But how to get 8 using 53, 53, and 8. Wait, but 8 is already present. So maybe 99 - (53/53) *8. Let's compute: 53/53=1. Then 1*8=8. 99-8=91. Oh! Wait, that could work. Let me check. The numbers used would be 99, 53, 53, 8. Each used once. The equation would be 99 - (53 / 53) * 8. But division and multiplication have the same precedence, so left to right. So 53/53 is 1, multiplied by 8 is 8. Then 99-8=91. Exactly! So that uses all numbers once. Let me verify:\n\n53 divided by 53 is 1. Then 1 multiplied by 8 is 8. Then 99 minus 8 is 91. Yes. And all numbers are used: 99, 53, 53, 8. Each exactly once. Perfect. So the equation would be 99 - (53 / 53) * 8. Or maybe written as 99 - (53 / 53 * 8). Either way, the operations are correct. So that's the solution.\n</think>\n\n<answer>99 - (53 / 53) * 8 = 91</answer>"}]}

Each number can only be used once, and I can use basic operations. Hmm, so I need to figure out how to combine these numbers with +, -, *, / to reach 266.\n\nFirst, maybe I should look for numbers that can multiply to get close to 266. Let's check the bigger numbers. 91 and 82 are the largest. If I multiply 91 by something, let's see: 91*3 is 273, which is close to 266 but over. Maybe 91*2=182. Then I need 84 more. Hmm, but I have 53, 40, 82 left. Wait, 82 is already used if I used 91. Wait, no, if I use 91 in a multiplication, then I need to use the others. Let's think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe subtract. Let's try combining 91 and 53. 91 + 53 is 144. Then maybe multiply that by something. 144*2 is 288, which is higher than 266. Not sure. What if I subtract 40 from 91? 91-40=51. Then 51 * 5.2 (but fractions are allowed?), but we need to use exact numbers. Maybe 53 and 82. Let's see.\n\nWait, 82 divided by 40 is 2.05. If I multiply that by 53, that's 2.05 *53 ≈ 108.65. Then add 91? 108.65 +91≈200. Not enough. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 82 - 40 = 42. Then 53 + 91=144. 144 * 42 is way too big. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe 82*3 is 246. Then 246 +20=266. But how to get 20 from 53, 40, 91? Hmm. Wait, 40 divided by (something). Wait, but 40/2 is 20. But where to get 2? If I use 53 and 91, maybe 91-53=38. Not helpful. 53-40=13. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 53*5=265. Close to 266. How to get 5? 40/8=5, but I don't have an 8. Wait, 82- (something). 82 - (53 +40)=82-93= -11. Not helpful. \n\nWait, maybe 91 + 82 = 173. Then 53 +40=93. 173 +93=266. Oh, wait! That's adding all of them: 53 +40 +91 +82. Let me check: 53+40=93, 93+91=184, 184+82=266. Oh! Wait, that's just adding all the numbers together. But the problem says \"create an equation that equals 266. You can use basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) one or multiple times but each number can only be used once, and you must use all the numbers.\" So adding them all is allowed. Wait, is that possible? Let me add them up: 53 +40 is 93, plus 91 is 184, plus 82 is 266. Yes! So the equation is simply 53 + 40 +91 +82 =266. But does that count? Because the problem says \"create an equation\", and if all operations are addition, and using each number once, then that's valid. But maybe I'm missing something. Let me check again the problem statement.\n\n\"Using the numbers 53, 40, 91, 82, create an equation that equals 266.

Hmm. Let's start by thinking about possible combinations. \n\nFirst, maybe I can subtract some numbers to get close. Let's see, 95 minus 86 is 9. Then I have 27 and 31 left. If I subtract 9 from something... Wait, 27 and 31. Let's see, 27 + 31 is 58. Then 58 minus 9 would be 49. Wait, so that would be (27 + 31) - (95 - 86). Let me check that: 27+31=58, 95-86=9, 58-9=49. That works! But wait, did I use all numbers? Let's see: 86,27,95,31. Yes, all four numbers are used once. So that would be (27 + 31) - (95 - 86) = 49.\n\nWait, but let me make sure there's no other way. Maybe another combination. For example, maybe using division. Let's see, 95 divided by something. 95 divided by 5 is 19, but 5 isn't here. Alternatively, 86 divided by something. 86 divided by 2 is 43, but again, 2 isn't present. \n\nAnother approach: 31 - 27 is 4. Then 86 - (95 -4). Wait, 95 -4=91. 86-91 is -5. Not helpful. Or maybe 95 - (86 + something). Let's see, 86 plus 27 is 113. 95 minus 113 is -18. Not useful. \n\nHow about multiplication? 27* something. 27*2=54, but 54 minus 5 is 49. Hmm, but how to get 5 from the remaining numbers. Maybe 31 - (95-86)=31-9=22. Not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, 86 - 31=55. Then 55 minus (95-27)=55-68=-13. No. \n\nWait, but the first idea I had works. So (27 +31) - (95 -86)=49. Let me check the order of operations again. 95-86 is 9. 27+31 is 58. 58-9=49. Yes. So that's the equation. All numbers used once, and operations are subtraction and addition. \n\nI think that's the correct answer. Let me just make sure there's no other possible way. Let's try another angle. Suppose I do 95 - 27=68. Then 86 -31=55. 68-55=13. No. Not 49. \n\nOr 86 -27=59. Then 95 -31=64. 59 +64=123. Not helpful. \n\nWait, 31* something. 31*1=31. Then 86 -31=55. 55 + something. 55+27=82. 95-82=13. Not 49. \n\nAlternatively, 86 divided by something. 86/2=43, but 2 isn't available. 86/(95- something). 95-27=68. 86/68 is about 1.26. Not useful. \n\nHmm, maybe another combination. Let's see: 95 - (86 - (31 -27)). Let's compute inside out. 31-27=4. 86-4=82. 95-82=13. No. \n\nOr 31 - (95 -86) +27. That's 31 -9 +27=49. Wait, that's 31-9=22, 22+27=49. Wait, that uses 95,86 to make 9, then 31,27. So that's 31 - (95 -86) +27. Let me check the numbers: 95,86 used once, 31,27 used once. So that would be 31 - (95 -86) +27 =49. Let's compute: 95-86=9. 31-9=22. 22+27=49. Yes. That's another possible equation. \n\nWait, so that's a different equation using all four numbers. So which one is better? The problem allows using the numbers once each, any operations. Both equations are valid. Let me check if the problem requires using all four numbers, which they do. \n\nSo in the second equation: 31 - (95 -86) +27. That's the same as (31 +27) - (95 -86). Which is the same as the first equation I had. Wait, no. Wait, addition is commutative. So 31 - (95-86) +27 is the same as (31 +27) - (95 -86). Because subtraction is left associative. Let me verify:\n\nOriginal expression: 31 - (95 -86) +27. The subtraction and addition are left to right. So first compute 31 - (95-86) = 31 -9=22, then add 27 to get 49. Alternatively, grouping (31 +27) - (95 -86) gives 58 -9=49. So both expressions are equivalent. So the equation can be written as (31 + 27) - (95 - 86) =49 or (31 - (95 -86)) +27=49. Either way, the same result. \n\nBut the problem might prefer not having a leading parenthesis, but perhaps the first version is better. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects a different order. Let me check the numbers again. The numbers are 86,27,95,31. The first equation uses 27,31,95,86. The second uses 31,95,86,27. Either way, all numbers are used once. \n\nSo either equation is acceptable. However, the first one groups 27+31 and 95-86, which might be considered more straightforward. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another equation. Let me think again. For example, 86 - (95 - (31 -27)). Let's compute: 31-27=4, 95-4=91, 86-91= -5. Not useful. \n\nOr 95 - 86=9. Then 31 -27=4. 9*4=36. Not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, 95 divided by (something). 95/ (31-27)=95/4=23.75. Then 23.75 + 86=109.75. No. \n\nHmm. So seems like the only possible equations are those combining the additions and subtractions. \n\nSo the equation would be (27 +31) - (95 -86) =49. Or 27 +31 -95 +86. Wait, that's 27+31=58, -95+86= -9, 58-9=49. So that's equivalent. So another way to write it is 27 +31 +86 -95=49. Because 27+31+86=144, 144-95=49. Wait, that's another way to express it. So 86 +27 +31 -95=49. Let me check: 86+27=113, 113+31=144, 144-95=49. Yes. So that's another expression. \n\nIn this case, all numbers are used once, and the equation is 86 +27 +31 -95=49. That's a simpler way without parentheses. \n\nWait, but the problem allows using operations multiple times but each number once. So adding 86,27,31 and subtracting 95 gives 49. That's a valid equation. So perhaps that's the better answer because it's simpler. \n\nBut why didn't I think of that earlier? Because I was focused on grouping numbers. But if you just add 86+27+31 and subtract 95, that's 144-95=49. All numbers used once. Yes. \n\nSo that equation is 86 +27 +31 -95=49. \n\nWait, but does that use all numbers? 86,27,31,95. Yes, all four. So that's another valid solution. \n\nSo which one is the correct answer? Both are correct. But perhaps the problem expects one of them. Let me check which one is more straightforward. The sum of three numbers minus the fourth. Since 86+27+31=144, then 144-95=49. So that's a possible equation. \n\nSo the equation can be written as 86 +27 +31 -95=49. Alternatively, with parentheses: (86 +27 +31) -95=49. But parentheses might not be necessary here because addition and subtraction are left associative. \n\nBut the problem might prefer the version with the least parentheses. So the answer could be 86 +27 +31 -95=49. \n\nAlternatively, if I have to arrange the numbers in a different order, but since addition is commutative, the order can vary. \n\nSo, in summary, there are multiple correct equations, but the simplest one might be 86 +27 +31 -95=49. \n\nWait, let me check the arithmetic again. 86 +27=113. 113+31=144. 144-95=49. Correct. \n\nYes, that works. So that's using all four numbers once with three additions and a subtraction. \n\nSo, the answer is 86 +27 +31 -95=49. Or, with parentheses, but perhaps not needed. \n\nBut the problem allows any order and operations, as long as each number is used once. So both versions are acceptable. However, sometimes when creating equations, people might prefer not having leading parentheses, so the linear version might be better. \n\nTherefore, the equation is 86 +27 +31 -95=49.\n</think>\n\n<answer>86 + 27 + 31 - 95 = 49</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using the numbers 5, 3, 25, and 2, each exactly once, and the result should be 750. Hmm, 750 is a pretty big number, so probably multiplication will be involved here. Let's start by thinking about how to combine these numbers to get close to 750.\n\nFirst, I know that 25 multiplied by 30 is 750. But do I have a 30? Not directly, but maybe I can create 30 using the other numbers. Let's see, 5, 3, and 2. If I do 5 * 3 * 2, that's 30. So then, 25 * (5*3*2) would be 25*30=750. Wait, but that uses 25, 5, 3, and 2. That's all the numbers! But let me check if that's allowed. Each number is used once, and all are used. So the equation would be 25 * 5 * 3 * 2. Let me compute that step by step: 25*5 is 125, 125*3 is 375, 375*2 is 750. Perfect! But wait, is there another way? Maybe using division or addition? Let me verify.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 25* (something else). For example, 25*(3*10) would be 750, but 10 isn't directly there. Alternatively, 25* (5* (3*2)) which is the same as before. So that seems like the straightforward way. Let me check if that's the only possibility. Another approach could be combining addition or subtraction. For example, 25*30 =750, but again, 30 from 5*3*2. Another thought: 25* (5*6) =25*30=750, where 6 is 3*2. Again, same as before. So regardless of how I group it, the multiplication of all four numbers gives 25*5*3*2=750. Since all numbers are used once and only multiplication is used, that should be the correct equation. Let me just make sure that using all four numbers in multiplication without any other operations is allowed. The problem says basic arithmetic operations can be used multiple times, but each number once. So multiplication is allowed, and even though there are multiple multiplications, each number is used once. So yes, that works. Therefore, the equation is 25 * 5 * 3 * 2 = 750. So putting that into the required format with parentheses as needed, but since multiplication is associative, the parentheses aren't necessary. But maybe adding parentheses for clarity. Like (25 * 5) * (3 * 2) = 125 * 6 =750. Either way, the equation uses all numbers once with multiplication. So the answer should be (25 * 5) * (3 * 2) or just 25*5*3*2. Since the example uses parentheses, maybe include some for structure. Let me check if there's a different way. What if using division or addition? Let's see. Suppose we try 25* (5*(3 + 2)). That would be 25*(5*5)=25*25=625, which is less. Not enough. If we do 25*5 + 3*2, that's 125 +6=131. Nope. How about (25 +5)*(3*2)=30*6=180. Still not 750. Maybe (25*3)*(5*2)=75*10=750. Oh! Wait, that's another arrangement. 25*3 is 75, 5*2 is 10, then 75*10=750. So that's also a valid equation. So either (25*5*3*2) or (25*3)*(5*2). Both use all numbers once. The problem allows any arrangement as long as each number is used once and operations are basic. So either form is acceptable. The question is, which one to present. The example uses parentheses, so maybe grouping them into two pairs. So (25*3) * (5*2). Let me check that: 25*3 is 75, 5*2 is 10, 75*10=750. Yes. That's another valid way. So both ways are correct. Either way, the equation would work. So I can present it either as 25*5*3*2 or group them as (25*3)*(5*2). Since the problem says to use all numbers once and operations can be used multiple times, either is acceptable. Maybe grouping them into two parts might make the equation clearer. So I'll go with (25 * 3) * (5 * 2) = 750. That way, it's grouped into two multiplications first. Alternatively, maybe (25 * 5) * (3 * 2) as well. Either grouping is fine. The answer just needs to be a valid equation using each number once. So I can choose either. Let me confirm once again the arithmetic:\n\n25 multiplied by 3 is 75. 5 multiplied by 2 is 10. Then 75 multiplied by 10 is 750. Correct. So that works. So the equation would be (25 * 3) * (5 * 2) = 750. Alternatively, without parentheses: 25 * 3 * 5 * 2. But since the example uses parentheses, maybe include them. So I think (25 * 3) * (5 * 2) is a good way to present it.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(25 * 3) * (5 * 2)</answer>"}]}

Let me start by thinking about how these numbers can combine.\n\nFirst, looking at the numbers: 53 is the largest, followed by 29, 17, and 4. Since 95 is a relatively large number, maybe multiplication will be involved here. Let me see if multiplying some of the larger numbers can get close to 95.\n\n53 is a prime number, so multiplying it by something. If I take 53 * 17, that's 901, which is way too big. 53 * 4 is 212, still too big. 29 * 17 is 493, also way over. Hmm, maybe that's not the right approach. Let's think about adding and subtracting.\n\nWhat if I subtract some numbers? For example, 53 + 29 is 82. If I can get another 13 from the remaining numbers, 17 and 4. Let's see, 17 - 4 is 13. So 82 + 13 = 95. Wait, that works! So putting it all together: 53 + 29 + (17 - 4) = 95. Let me check that: 53 +29 is 82, 17-4 is 13, 82+13=95. Perfect! But wait, does that use all numbers once? 53,29,17,4 are all used. Yes. So that seems to work. Let me verify again:\n\n53 + 29 = 82\n\n17 - 4 = 13\n\n82 +13=95. Correct. So the equation would be (53 + 29) + (17 - 4) = 95. Alternatively, without the parentheses, but since order of operations might not affect here. Let me check if the parentheses are necessary. If written as 53 + 29 +17 -4, that's the same as (53+29+17)-4, which is 99-4=95. Wait, that's a different calculation. Wait, 53+29=82, 82+17=99, 99-4=95. Oh, right! So actually, if I just do 53 +29 +17 -4, that equals 95. Let me compute that again step by step:\n\n53 +29 = 82\n\n82 +17 = 99\n\n99 -4 = 95. Yes, that works. So that uses all numbers once with addition and subtraction. So the equation would be 53 + 29 +17 -4 =95. Let me make sure I haven't missed any other combinations. But this seems straightforward. So maybe that's the answer. Let me check if there's another way, just to be sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using multiplication. For example, 4 * something. Let's see: 4*17=68, then 53 + 29=82, 82 +68=150. That's too high. What if 4*(53 - something). Let's see: 53 -29=24. 4*24=96. Then 96-17=79. Not enough. 96-1=95, but I don't have a 1. Hmm.\n\nAnother possibility: 53 -17=36. 36 * something. 36 *2=72. But I don't have a 2. If I use 4 and 29, maybe 29 - (4/ something). Wait, 29 - (17/4) is 29-4.25=24.75, but that's a decimal. Not sure if fractions are allowed, but the problem says basic operations. Maybe, but 24.75 *4=99, which is not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 29*4=116. Then 116 -53=63. 63 +17=80. Not 95. Hmm. How about 53 + (29*17)/4. Let's see: 29*17=493. 493/4 is about 123.25. 53 +123.25=176.25. Nope. Not helpful.\n\nAnother approach: 53 + (29 -17) *4. 29-17=12. 12*4=48. 53+48=101. Not 95. Close, but not quite.\n\nOr 53 - (29 -17) *4. 29-17=12. 12*4=48. 53-48=5. Not good.\n\nWhat if 17*4=68. Then 68 +53=121. 121 -29=92. Close to 95. 92 +3=95, but no 3 available. Alternatively, 121 - (29 + something). 29 + something=26, which would make 121-26=95. But how to get 26 from the remaining numbers. Wait, I used 17 and 4 already. So maybe not.\n\nWait, let's try another angle. If I do 53 + 29 +17 -4=95, that's straightforward. Let me check if that's correct. 53+29=82, 82+17=99, 99-4=95. Yep. That works. So why didn't I think of that earlier? Maybe that's the simplest way. Let me confirm that all numbers are used once: 53,29,17,4. Yes. So the equation is 53 +29 +17 -4 =95. So maybe that's the answer. But let me check if there's another possible combination. For example, using division.\n\nSuppose I take 53 and divide it by something. 53 divided by 4 is about 13.25. Then 13.25 *17=225.25. Minus 29 is 196.25. Not helpful. Alternatively, 53 divided by (17-4) is 53/13≈4.07. 4.07*29≈118.07. No. Not 95.\n\nAlternatively, 29 divided by something. 29/4=7.25. 7.25*17=123.25. 123.25-53=70.25. Nope.\n\nAnother thought: 17*5=85. 85 + something. But 5 is not here. Maybe 17* (4 + something). 17*(4+1)=85. But no 1. Alternatively, 17*(53-29)/4. 53-29=24. 24/4=6. 17*6=102. Not helpful.\n\nHmm. Maybe another way. Let's think about 53 + (29 - (17/4)). 17/4 is 4.25. 29-4.25=24.75. 53+24.75=77.75. Not 95.\n\nAlternatively, (53 -29) * (17 -4). 53-29=24. 17-4=13. 24*13=312. Way too big.\n\nWait, maybe 53 + (29* (17 -4)). 17-4=13. 29*13=377. 53+377=430. Nope.\n\nSo far, the only equation that works is the simple addition and subtraction: 53 +29 +17 -4 =95. Let me check once again. 53+29=82. 82+17=99. 99-4=95. Correct. All numbers used once. Operations are +, +, -.\n\nSo that seems to be the answer. I don't see any other combinations that would result in 95 using all four numbers once. So the final equation is 53 + 29 + 17 - 4 = 95.\n</think>\n\n<answer>53 + 29 + 17 - 4 = 95</answer>"}]}

I need to use the numbers 50, 15, 6, and 27 each exactly once, along with basic arithmetic operations, to make 540. Hmm. First, I should think about what operations can get me to a larger number since 540 is significantly bigger than most of these numbers. Multiplication is probably going to be key here.\n\nLet me start by looking at the numbers. 50 is the largest, followed by 27, 15, and then 6. Maybe multiplying some of the larger numbers together. Let's see: 50 times 15 is 750. That's more than 540. If I subtract something from that, maybe. 750 minus (27 + 6) is 750 - 33 = 717, which is still too much. Alternatively, 50 times 27 is 1350. That's way over. Maybe dividing somewhere?\n\nWait, 540 divided by 50 is 10.8. So maybe I can get 10.8 by using 15, 6, and 27. Let me see. 15 minus 6 is 9, and 27 divided by 9 is 3. Hmm, that's 3. Not helpful. Alternatively, 15 plus 6 is 21, and 27 minus 21 is 6. Then 6 divided by something? Not sure.\n\nAnother approach: maybe multiply two numbers and then another two, then combine. Let's see. 50 * 15 = 750, 27 * 6 = 162. Then 750 - 162 = 588. Close to 540 but not quite. Alternatively, 50 * 27 = 1350, 15 * 6 = 90. Then 1350 / 90 = 15. That's not helpful.\n\nWait, 540 is 15 multiplied by 36. Can I get 36 from the remaining numbers? 50, 6, 27. Let's see: 50 - (27 + 6) = 17. Not 36. 27 + 6 = 33. 50 - 33 = 17. Still not. How about 50 - 27 = 23, 23 + 6 = 29. Nope. Alternatively, 27 - 6 = 21. 50 - 21 = 29. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 50 * 6 = 300. Then 15 * 27 = 405. 300 + 405 = 705. Not 540. Hmm. 50 * 15 is 750. If I can subtract 210 from that, but how? 27 and 6. 27*6=162. 750 - 162 = 588. Still not 540.\n\nWait, 540 divided by 6 is 90. So if I can get 90 using 50, 15, and 27. Let's see. 50 + 15 = 65, 27 + 65 = 92. Close. 50 + 27 = 77. 77 + 15 = 92 again. Not 90. 50 - 15 = 35, 35 + 27 = 62. Still not. 27 - 15 = 12. 50 - 12 = 38. No.\n\nAlternatively, 15 * 6 = 90. Then 50 and 27. 90 * (50 - 27) = 90 *23=2070. No. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe 540 is 27 * 20. So can I get 20 from 50, 15, 6? 50 - (15 + 6) = 29. Not 20. 15 + 6 =21, 50 -21=29. Hmm. Alternatively, 50 / (15 - 6) = 50/9 ≈5.555. Then 27 * that would be about 150, not 540.\n\nAlternatively, 50 - (27 -15) =50 -12=38. 38 *6=228. Nope.\n\nWait, maybe grouping differently. Let's think of 540 as 50 * 10.8. How to get 10.8 from 15, 6, 27. 27 divided by (15 -6) = 27/9=3. Then 50*3=150. Not 540. Alternatively, (15 + 6) * (27 - something). 21* something. Hmm.\n\nWait, 15 * 6 =90. 90 *6=540. But I need to use 27 and 50. Wait, maybe 90 * (50 - (27 - something))? Not sure. Alternatively, 50 * 15 =750. Then 750 - (27*6)=750-162=588.

Let's compute that: 50*27=1350. 1350*15=20250. 20250/6=3375. Too much.\n\nAlternatively, (50*15*6)/27. 50*15=750. 750*6=4500. 4500/27≈166.666. No.\n\nWait, 540 is divisible by 6. 540/6=90.

Wait, but I need to use all numbers once. So if I do (50*(27/15))*6. Let's check: 27 divided by 15 is 1.8. 50 times 1.8 is 90. 90 times 6 is 540. Yes! So that would be (50 * (27 / 15)) * 6 =540. All numbers used exactly once. Let me check: 50, 27,15,6. Yes. Each used once. So the equation is (50 * (27 / 15)) * 6 =540. Alternatively, written without parentheses where possible, but need to make sure order of operations. So 50*(27/15)*6. Let me compute: 27/15 is 1.8, 50*1.8=90, 90*6=540. Perfect. So the equation is (50 * 27 / 15) * 6 =540. Or another way to arrange the parentheses, but that's the basic structure.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(50 * 27 / 15) * 6 = 540</answer>"}]}

Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, 418 is a relatively large number, so I probably need to use multiplication to get there. Let's see what combinations of these numbers multiplied together might get close.\n\nLooking at the numbers, 22 and 38 are the two largest. If I multiply them, 22 * 38 = 836. That's way larger than 418, so maybe I need to divide that product by something. But 836 divided by 2 is 418, but I don't have a 2. Alternatively, maybe subtract something from 836 to get 418. 836 - 418 = 418, but again, that would require another 418, which I don't have. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe combine 38 and 6 first. Let's see, 38 * 6 = 228. If I add 22 to that, 228 + 22 = 250, which is still too low. If I multiply 228 by something else, but I have to use all numbers. So 228 * 3 would be 684, which is over but not 418. Alternatively, 38 * 6 = 228, then subtract 22 and 3? That would be 228 -22 -3=203. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe use 22 and 38 in a different way. Let's try 38 * 11 = 418. Wait, 38 times 11 is indeed 418. But how can I get 11 using 6, 3, and 22? Wait, I have to use all numbers. Oh, but 22 is already part of the original numbers. Wait, the numbers I have are 22, 38, 6, 3. So if I can somehow use 22 as part of generating 11. Because 22 divided by 2 is 11. But I don't have a 2. Alternatively, 6 divided by 3 is 2. So 22 divided by (6/3) would be 22/(2) =11. Then 38 multiplied by that would be 38*11=418. Let me check that.\n\nSo 38 * (22 / (6 / 3)). Let's compute step by step: 6 divided by 3 is 2. Then 22 divided by 2 is 11. Then 38 * 11 is 418. That uses all numbers: 38, 22, 6, 3. Each once, and the operations are division and multiplication. So the equation would be 38 * (22 / (6 / 3)). Let me verify:\n\nFirst, compute 6/3 = 2. Then 22 / 2 = 11. Then 38 * 11 = 418. Yes! That works.\n\nWait, but does the order of operations allow that? Let me write it properly with parentheses. Yes, because in the expression 38 * (22 / (6 / 3)), the innermost parentheses are 6/3, then 22 divided by that result, then multiplied by 38. So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe other combinations. Let me think if there's another way. For example, 22 * 3 = 66. 66 * 6 = 396. 396 + 38 = 434. That's over. 66 + 38 = 104. 104 * 6=624. Not helpful. Or 38 - 6 =32. 32 * 22 =704. 704 /3 is about 234. Not close. \n\nAlternatively, 38 + 6 =44. 44 * (22 -3)=44*19=836. Then maybe 836 divided by 2 is 418, but again, getting a 2 from where. But 6/3 is 2. So 836 / (6/3) =836 /2=418. Wait, that's another approach. Let me check: (38 +6) * (22 -3) / (6/3). Wait, but that would use 6 twice. Wait, no. If I have (38 +6) * (22 -3) =44*19=836. Then divide by (6/3) which is 2. But then 836 /2=418. But here, I used 6 and 3 in the division, but in the first part, I already used 6 in the 38+6. So that would be using 6 twice, which is not allowed. So that approach doesn't work.\n\nSo the first solution I found is 38 * (22 / (6 / 3)) =418. Let's confirm again:\n\n6 divided by 3 is 2.\n\n22 divided by 2 is 11.\n\n38 multiplied by 11 is 418.\n\nYes, that uses all numbers once each. So that's the equation.\n</think>\n\n<answer>38 * (22 / (6 / 3))</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using all the numbers 24, 307, 25, and 78 exactly once, with basic operations, to get 228. Hmm.\n\nFirst, let me think about the target number. 228. Breaking it down, 228 is 24 multiplied by 9.5, but that's not helpful. Maybe 228 is 25 times 9.12, but again, fractions could complicate things. Alternatively, 228 divided by 24 is 9.5. Not sure. Maybe I should look for combinations that can get close to 228.\n\nLet me list the numbers again: 24, 307, 25, 78. The largest number here is 307, so maybe I can subtract something from it. 307 minus what? Let's see: 307 - 78 = 229. Oh, that's very close to 228. So 307 - 78 = 229. Then I need to adjust that by 1 to get 228. But how?\n\nWait, I have 24 and 25 left. If I can use 24 and 25 to make 1, then maybe subtract that. But 25 - 24 = 1. So putting it all together: 307 - 78 - (25 - 24) = 307 - 78 - 1 = 228. Let's check that: 307 minus 78 is 229, then subtract 1 gives 228. That works! And all numbers are used once: 307, 78, 25, 24. The operations are subtraction and another subtraction with the parentheses. So the equation would be (307 - 78) - (25 - 24) = 228. Wait, let me compute that step by step. First, 307 -78 is 229. Then 25 -24 is 1. Then 229 -1 is indeed 228. Perfect!\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any other possible combinations. Alternatively, maybe using multiplication or division. For example, 25 * 24 is 600. Then subtract 307 and 78? 600 -307 = 293, then 293 -78 = 215. Not 228. Or 78 * 3 = 234, but where do I get the 3 from? Maybe 24 divided by 8 (but 8 isn't a number here). Hmm. Alternatively, 25 * 9.12 is 228, but getting 9.12 from other numbers... Maybe 307 divided by something. 307 /25 is around 12.28. Not helpful. 78 /24 is 3.25. Maybe 25 * (78/24) is around 81.25. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 307 - (25 * something). Let's see. 25 * 9 = 225, so 307 -225 is 82. Not helpful. 307 -25=282, then 282 -78=204, and 204 +24=228. Wait, that's 307 -25 -78 +24. Let's compute: 307-25=282, 282-78=204, 204+24=228. Oh, that works too! Wait, but let me check if all numbers are used: 307,25,78,24. Yes. And operations: -, -, +. So that's another equation: 307 -25 -78 +24 =228. Let me verify: 307-25=282; 282-78=204; 204+24=228. Yes, that's correct. So there's another way. But maybe the first solution is more straightforward, but this is also valid.\n\nWait, but the question didn't specify that I have to find all possible equations, just one. So either of these would work. Let me check which one uses the operations correctly. Both equations use each number once. The first one is (307 -78) - (25 -24)=228. The second one is 307 -25 -78 +24=228. Both are correct. But maybe the first one uses parentheses, which might be necessary depending on the order of operations. For example, the second equation doesn't need parentheses because subtraction and addition are left associative. So 307 -25 -78 +24 is computed as ((307 -25) -78) +24. Which is correct. So both equations are valid.\n\nBut the user might prefer an equation that uses all four numbers and operations more creatively. However, both solutions are valid. Let me see which one to choose. The first solution uses subtraction of two terms: (307 -78) and (25 -24), which is a bit more complex. The second is straightforward sequential operations. Maybe the first one is more interesting. Let me check again if I can find any other equations.\n\nAnother approach: maybe using division. For example, 78 /24 =3.25. Then multiply by something. 3.25 *25=81.25. 307-81.25=225.75. Not helpful. Alternatively, 307 divided by something. 307 /25 =12.28. Then 12.28 *24=294.72. 294.72 -78=216.72. Not close. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, 25*78=1950. Then 1950 divided by something. 1950 /307≈6.35. Then 6.35*24≈152.4. Not helpful. Maybe 25*24=600. 600-307=293. 293-78=215. No. Alternatively, 307-25=282. 282* something. 282/78=3.615. Multiply by 24? 3.615*24≈86.76. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, (78 -24)=54. 54* something. 54*4.222=228. But where do I get 4.222? 307 divided by 73? 307/73≈4.205. Not exactly. Maybe 25 + (307/(78-24))= 25 + (307/54)=25+5.685≈30.685. Not helpful.\n\nHmm. So the two equations I found earlier seem to be the valid ones. Let me pick the first one because it uses parentheses and combines numbers in a slightly more complex way. So the equation would be (307 - 78) - (25 - 24) = 228. Let's verify again: 307-78 is 229. 25-24 is 1. 229-1=228. Correct. All numbers used once. Operations are subtraction and subtraction. Another option is 307 -25 -78 +24=228, which is also correct. But the first one uses parentheses, which might be considered a better answer. But the user might accept either. Since the example uses parentheses, maybe the first one is preferred. Alternatively, the second equation is simpler and doesn't need parentheses. Let me check the second equation again: 307-25 is 282, minus 78 is 204, plus 24 is 228. So yes, that works. Both are correct. Maybe there's another equation using multiplication or division. Let me think again.\n\nWait, 24*25=600. 600 - (307 +78)=600 -385=215. Not 228. Close. 24*25=600. 600-307=293. 293-78=215. Still no. Alternatively, 307-78=229. 25-24=1. 229-1=228. So that's the first equation. Alternatively, 307 - (78 +25 -24). Let's compute: 78+25=103. 103-24=79. 307-79=228. Yes, that's another way. So 307 - (78 +25 -24)=228. Let's check: 78+25=103. 103-24=79. 307-79=228. Correct. So this equation uses all numbers and operations. The equation would be 307 - (78 +25 -24) =228. That's another valid equation. So maybe that's another way to write it, grouping the 78,25,24 together. Let me verify:\n\n307 - (78 +25 -24) = 307 - (103 -24) = 307 -79=228. Yes. So this uses addition and subtraction inside the parentheses. So this is another valid equation. So there are multiple correct answers. But the user wants one equation. Since the problem allows any combination as long as each number is used once and all are used, all three equations I found are correct. The user example used parentheses, so perhaps the answer with parentheses is expected. The three possible equations:\n\n1. (307 -78) - (25 -24) =228\n\n2. 307 -25 -78 +24=228\n\n3. 307 - (78 +25 -24)=228\n\nAll are correct. Which one is best? The first and third use parentheses and combine the numbers in different ways. The second is straightforward. Since the example in the user's question used parentheses, maybe the first or third is better. Let's pick the third one because it groups three numbers together. But the first one uses all numbers in two separate groups. Alternatively, the third one requires three numbers in the parentheses.\n\nHmm. The user might prefer the first equation because it's two separate operations. But I think any of them are acceptable. To confirm, let me check the third equation again. 78 +25=103. 103-24=79. 307-79=228. Correct. So 307 - (78 +25 -24) =228. That works, and all numbers are used once. So this is also a valid answer.\n\nTherefore, the problem has multiple solutions, but I need to choose one. Let's pick the first one I found: (307 -78) - (25 -24) =228. Because it's two separate subtractions, each grouping two numbers. Alternatively, the third equation is also good. Either way, both are correct. Since the user allows any basic operations and multiple uses, both are acceptable. So I'll present one of them.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(307 - 78) - (25 - 24) = 228</answer>"}]}

I need to make an equation using 53, 53, 77, and 648, each exactly once, with basic operations to get 725. Hmm. Let's start by thinking about what operations might get close.\n\nFirst, 725 is a bit less than 648 + 77, which would be 725... Wait, 648 + 77 is exactly 725! Oh, but wait, we also have the two 53s. Oh, but we have to use all the numbers. So that approach can't work because adding 648 and 77 gives 725, but then we're left with the two 53s unused. So that's a problem. So maybe I need to combine them in some way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe subtract or multiply parts. Let me think. If I take 648 and subtract something to get 725, but 648 is less than 725, so subtraction won't help there. Maybe division? Let's see.\n\nWait, maybe 648 divided by something? Like 648 divided by a number to get a smaller number, but how would that help reach 725? Maybe not. Alternatively, 648 plus something. Let's see: 648 plus 77 is 725, but again, that uses two numbers and leaves the two 53s. So maybe need to find a way to use all four numbers. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe combine 53 and 53 first. Since there are two 53s, maybe add them: 53 + 53 = 106. Then, 106 plus 77 is 183. Then, 648 minus 183 is 465. Not helpful. Or maybe multiply 106 by something. 106 * 7 = 742, which is close to 725 but not exact. Hmm.\n\nWait, what if we do 53 * 53? That's 2809. That's way too big. Maybe divide 2809 by something. 2809 / 648 is about 4.33, not helpful. Maybe subtract 77 from 2809? 2809 -77=2732. Still way over. Not useful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe combine 77 and 53. Let's see: 77 +53=130, 77-53=24, 77*53=4081, which is way too big. 77/53≈1.45. Not helpful. \n\nWhat if we do 648 minus (something)? Let's think: 648 is a large number. 725 is bigger, so maybe we need to add to 648. 725 -648=77. So 648 +77=725. But then we have two 53s left. How can we use them? Maybe (648 +77) + (53 -53) = 725 +0=725. But does that count? Because that would be using all numbers, but the two 53s cancel each other. The problem says \"you must use all the numbers\" but each number can be used once. So that's allowed. Wait, but is that acceptable? Let me check the problem statement again: \"each number can only be used once, and you must use all the numbers\". So the two 53s are separate numbers. So using both as (53 -53) is allowed, as each is used once. But does the equation (648 +77) + (53 -53) equal 725? Yes. But maybe the user wants all numbers to be used in the main operations, but perhaps that's acceptable. But is that the intended solution? Because the example given in the problem is (1 + 2) / 3, which uses each number once, but here we have 648, 77, 53, 53, and using them all as (648 +77) + (53 -53) = 725. Let's check: 648+77=725, 53-53=0, so total 725. But the problem might require all numbers to be used in a non-zero way. Hmm. Maybe not. The problem doesn't specify that the numbers can't be used in a way that cancels out. So maybe that's a possible solution. But maybe there's a better solution that uses all numbers in a non-trivial way. Let me check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe multiply 53 and 77. 53*77=4081. Then 4081 divided by 648 is approximately 6.3, which is not helpful. Maybe 4081 -648=3433, way too big.\n\nWait, 648 divided by something. Let's see, 648 divided by (77-53) would be 648/(24)=27. Then 27 times 53 would be 1401. Not helpful. Or 53 +27=80. Not 725.\n\nAlternatively, 53* (77 - (648 /53)). Let's compute 648 divided by 53. 53*12=636, so 648/53=12 + 12/53 ≈12.226. Then 77 -12.226≈64.774. Multiply by 53: 64.774*53≈3433. That's way over. Not helpful.\n\nAnother approach: 648 - (77 +53 +53) = 648 -183=465. No. Not 725.\n\nWait, maybe (53 *53) - 77 +648. Let's compute 53*53=2809. 2809 -77=2732. 2732 +648=3380. No.\n\nHmm. Maybe 77*53=4081. Then 4081 - (648 +53) =4081 -701=3380 again.\n\nAlternatively, 648 +77=725. Then 53 and 53. If we can somehow get 53 -53=0, then the total equation is 725 +0=725. So that would be (648 +77) + (53 -53) =725. But is that acceptable? The problem states you can use the operations one or multiple times. So addition and subtraction are allowed. Each number is used once. So that seems to fit. Let me verify the calculation: 648 +77=725. Then 53-53=0. Adding them together: 725 +0=725. Yes. So this equation uses all numbers once. But maybe the user expects a more \"creative\" use, but according to the problem's rules, this is acceptable. However, perhaps there's another way without having the two 53s cancel each other.\n\nLet me think again. Let's see: 725 = 648 +77. That's the key. So if I can make 648 +77 using those numbers, and then use the two 53s in a way that doesn't affect the sum. So like 648 +77 + (53 -53). But maybe another approach.\n\nAlternatively, multiply 53 by something and then add or subtract. For example, 53*13=689. 689 + something to get 725. 725-689=36. But where to get 36? 77- something. Wait, 77 -53=24. Not 36. Hmm. Or 53*14=742. 742 is 17 more than 725. 742 -17=725. How to get 17? 77 - (648 /53). Let's compute 648/53=12.226. 77 -12.226≈64.774. Not helpful. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, 53*(77 - (648/53)) +53. Let's compute that. 648/53=12.226. 77 -12.226≈64.774. 64.774*53≈3433. 3433 +53=3486. No, way too big.\n\nWait, maybe 53*(something) + something else. Let me think of 53*13=689. 725-689=36. 36 can be 77-53=24. No. 77-53=24, which isn't 36. Alternatively, 77 - (53 - x) where x is another number. But we have to use all numbers. Wait, this seems messy.\n\nAlternatively, 53* (something) - (something). Let's see, 53*14=742. 742 -17=725. So 742 -17=725. How to get 17 from the remaining numbers, which are 53, 77, 648. Wait, but if we use 53 in the multiplication, then the remaining numbers are 77 and 648. 648/77≈8.415. Not 17. Hmm. 77-53=24. Not 17. 648-53=595. Not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, 53*13=689. 725-689=36. 36 can be 77 -53=24. No. Hmm. Not helpful.\n\nWait, another angle: 725 divided by 5 is 145. Maybe something with 53 and 77 adding up to 130, which is 145-15. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, 648 + (77* (53/53)). Because 53/53=1, so 77*1=77. Then 648+77=725. And the two 53s are used in the division. That works. Let's see: 53 divided by 53 is 1. Then 77*1=77. Then 648+77=725. So the equation would be 648 + (77 * (53 /53)) =725. That uses all numbers: 648, 77, 53, 53. Each once. And the operations are division, multiplication, and addition. That seems to fit. Let me check: 53/53=1. 77*1=77. 648+77=725. Yes. So this is a valid equation. And all numbers are used once. That's better than the previous idea where 53-53 is zero, because here the two 53s are used in a division. So maybe this is the answer.\n\nYes, that works. So the equation is 648 + (77 × (53 ÷ 53)) =725. Let's verify: 53÷53=1, 77×1=77, 648+77=725. Perfect. So this uses all four numbers exactly once. Each number is used once, and all are used. The operations are division, multiplication, and addition. So that should be the correct answer.\n</think>\n\n<answer>648 + 77 * (53 / 53) = 725</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using the numbers 88, 90, 37, and 12 exactly once each, with basic arithmetic operations, and the result should be 518. Hmm, okay. Let's start by thinking about the target number, 518. What's its approximate value? Around 500, so maybe combining the larger numbers first could help.\n\nFirst, let me note down the numbers: 88, 90, 37, 12. The bigger numbers here are 88 and 90. If I can combine those in a way that gets close to 500, then maybe the remaining numbers can adjust it to 518. Let's try subtracting them first. 90 minus 88 is 2. That's too small. What if I add them? 90 + 88 = 178. Hmm, still way below 500. So maybe multiplication? 90 times 88 would be 7920, which is way too high. That's not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider combining 90 and 37 first. Let's see. 90 minus 37 is 53. Then 53 times something. If I have 53, maybe multiply by 12? 53 * 12 is 636. Then subtract 88? 636 - 88 = 548. That's still over. But 548 is 30 more than 518. Hmm, maybe not the right path.\n\nAlternatively, 90 divided by something. 90 divided by 12 is 7.5. Then 7.5 times 37 is 277.5. Adding 88 gives 365.5. Not close. Maybe not useful.\n\nWhat if I try 88 multiplied by something? 88 * 12 is 1056. Then subtract 90? 1056 - 90 = 966. Still too high. If I subtract 37, that's 966 - 37 = 929. Nope. Maybe subtract 37 first? 1056 - 37 = 1019, then subtract 90 is 929. Not helpful.\n\nWait, let's think about 518. 518 divided by 10 is 51.8. So maybe something around 51.8. Let's see. If I can get 50-something times 10. Hmm. 90 divided by 12 is 7.5. Then 7.5 times something. Let me see. 37 + 88 = 125. 125 times 7.5 is 937.5. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 37 times 12 is 444. Then adding 88 gives 532. Then subtract 90? 532 - 90 = 442. Not 518. Hmm. 444 + 90 = 534, then subtract 88 is 446. Still not.\n\nWait, 88 times 6 is 528. Close to 518. How to get 6? Maybe 90 divided by (something). 90 divided by 15 is 6. But I don't have 15. But 37 - 12 = 25. Not helpful. 90 divided by (37 - 12) is 90/25 = 3.6. Then 88 * 3.6 is 316.8. Adding 12? No, numbers are already used.\n\nAlternatively, 88 * (90 - 37) = 88 *53. Let's calculate that. 88*50 is 4400, plus 88*3=264, total 4664. Then subtract 12? 4664 -12=4652. Way too high. Not helpful.\n\nHmm. Maybe 90 - (12 +37) = 90 -49=41. Then 88*41= 3608. Not close.\n\nWait, perhaps a combination of multiplication and addition. Let's see, 88 +90=178. Then 178 * something. If 178*3=534. Then subtract 16 to get 518. But where do I get 3 and 16? Not sure. Alternatively, 178* (37-12) =178*25=4450. No.\n\nAlternatively, 37*12=444. Then 444 +88=532. Then 532 - (90/ something). Wait, 90 divided by 5 is 18, but I don't have 5. Maybe 90 divided by 15 is 6. Wait, 37-12=25. 90/25=3.6. So 532 -3.6=528.4. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 37* (12 + something). Let's see, 12 + 88=100. 37*100=3700. Then subtract 90=3610. Nope.\n\nWait, maybe using division in a smart way. For example, 90 divided by something. Let's see, 90/(12) is 7.5. Then 7.5* (88 -37)=7.5*51=382.5. Adding the remaining number? Wait, already used 90, 12, 88, 37. All numbers are used. 382.5 is the total? No, but I need to use all numbers. So perhaps that approach is invalid.\n\nAnother angle: 518 = 88*6 - 10. Let's see, how to get 6 and 10. 12 - (90/ something). 90 divided by 9 is 10. But 9 is not available. 90 divided by 10 is 9. Hmm. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 12 + 37 =49. Then 90 -49=41. Then 88*41= 3608. Not close.\n\nWait, maybe 90 + 37 =127. 127*4=508. Then add 10 to get 518. But how to get 4 and 10. 12 -8=4, but 8 is not a number. 88 divided by something. 88 divided by 22=4. But 22 is not available. 88/12=7.333. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 88*5=440. 440 +78=518. How to get 5 and 78. 90 -12=78. So 88*(5) + (90 -12)=440 +78=518. But where do I get 5? 37 divided by something. 37 divided by 7.4 is 5, but that's not straightforward. Alternatively, 37 -12=25. 25/5=5. But that uses 37,12, and would need another 5. Not helpful.\n\nWait, let's try this:\n\nIf I can do 90 - 37 =53. Then 53*12=636. Then 636 - 88=548. 548 is 30 more than 518. Hmm. So maybe if I can subtract 30 more. But I don't have any numbers left. Already used 90,37,12,88. So that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, 88*12=1056. Then 1056 - 90=966. Then 966 -37=929. Still not helpful.\n\nWait, 90*12=1080. 1080 - 88=992. 992 -37=955. No.\n\nAnother approach: 37*14=518. But 14 isn't a number here. But maybe 14 can be made from 88,90,12. Let's see: 88 - (90/ something). 90 divided by 12 is 7.5. 88 -7.5=80.5. Not helpful. 12 + (something)=14? 12 +2=14. How to get 2? 90/ (something). 90 divided by 45 is 2. But 45 is not present. 88 - 37=51. 90/51≈1.76. Not helpful.\n\nHmm, maybe 518 divided by 37 is approximately 14. So 37*14=518. How to get 14 from 88,90,12. Let's see: 88 - (90-12)=88 -78=10. Not 14. 12 + (90/ something). 90 divided by 7.5=12. But 90 divided by 7.5 is 12. Then 12+12=24. Not 14. Alternatively, (88 - 90) +12= -2 +12=10. Still no.\n\nWait, 90 - (88 -12)=90 -76=14. Yes! So 90 - (88 -12)=14. Then 14*37=518. Let's check:\n\nFirst, compute 88 -12=76. Then 90 -76=14. Then 14*37=518. Perfect! And all numbers are used once: 88,12,90,37. Exactly. So the equation is (90 - (88 - 12)) * 37 = 518.\n\nLet me verify:\n\n88 -12 =76\n\n90 -76=14\n\n14*37= 518. Yes! That works.

If I divide 84 by something... Let's see. 84 divided by 14 is 6. Then maybe 6 times something else. Wait, 6 times 5 is 30, but I don't have a 5. Alternatively, 84 divided by 4 is 21.

If I take 14 and 9, 14*9=126. Then 126 divided by 4 is 31.5, which is close but not 30. Then subtract 84? No, that would go negative. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe 84 divided by something. Let's see, 84 divided by 14 is 6. Then 6 multiplied by 5 is 30. How can I get 5 from 9 and 4? 9 minus 4 is 5. Oh! So 84 divided by 14 is 6, then multiply by (9 minus 4). So 6 * 5 = 30.

Let's start by thinking about how these numbers can combine.\n\nFirst, I should check if multiplication is necessary because 830 is a relatively large number. Let me look at the numbers: 70 and 50 are the largest ones here. Multiplying them might get close. 70 times 50 is 3500, which is way over 830. So maybe that's not the way. What about 70 times 11? That's 770. Hmm, 770 is close to 830. Then if I can add 50 and 10, that's 60. Wait, 770 + 60 is 830. Oh, wait, that would require 70*11 + 50 +10. But that uses all numbers, right? 70 times 11 is 770, then add 50 and 10. Let me check: 70*11=770, then 770+50=820, then 820+10=830. Yes! That works. Wait, but does that use each number exactly once? Yes: 70, 11, 50, 10. All used once. The operations are multiplication and addition. So the equation would be (70 * 11) + 50 + 10. Let me write that as 70*11 + 50 +10. Let me check again: 70*11 is 770, plus 50 is 820, plus 10 is 830. Yep! That's exactly the target. So that's the equation. Alternatively, maybe parentheses aren't needed if the order is correct, but multiplication comes before addition, so it should be okay. So the answer is (70 * 11) + 50 + 10. Wait, but could there be another way? Let me think again. Suppose I tried something else. For example, 50*11 is 550. Then 70*10 is 700. Adding those gives 550+700=1250, which is way over. Not helpful. What about subtracting? Maybe 70*11 is 770, then 50*10 is 500. 770 +500=1270. No. Alternatively, 70*(11+50) =70*61=4270, way too big. Or 70*(50-11)=70*39=2730. Still no. Another approach: 10*(70+11) = 10*81=810. Then add 50- but 50 can't be used again. Wait, but if I use 10*(70+11) +50, that's 810 +50=860. Close but over. So 10*(70+11) =810. Then 860 is 860, not 830. So maybe subtract something. But I have to use all numbers. Hmm. Alternatively, 50*11=550. Then 70*10=700. 700 - 550=150. Not helpful. Or 50*10=500, plus 70*11=770, 500+770=1270. No. So back to the first idea, 70*11 +50 +10 gives 830. That seems to work. Let me make sure that all numbers are used once and only once. Yes: 70,11,50,10. Each is used once. So that's the equation. I think that's the solution.\n</think>\n\n<answer>70 * 11 + 50 + 10</answer>"}]}

Hmm. Let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall that all numbers must be used, so I can't leave any out. The target is 132. Let me see what 132 factors into. Well, 132 divided by 12 is 11, so maybe that's useful. Or perhaps 132 is 120 +12, or 140 -8. Not sure yet.\n\nLet me list the numbers I have: 25, 51, 96, 62. Let me see their approximate sizes. 96 is the largest, followed by 62, 51, then 25. So maybe combining the larger numbers first.\n\nIf I subtract 96 and 62, that's 34. Then 51 minus 25 is 26. 34 +26 is 60, which is way below 132. Hmm, not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, adding 96 and 62 gives 158. Then subtracting something. Let's see, 158 - 25 = 133. Close to 132. If I can get 158 -26, but how? Wait, but maybe 158 - (51 -25) = 158 -26=132. Wait, that could work. Let me check:\n\n96 +62 =158. Then 51 -25=26. Then 158 -26=132. But I have to use all the numbers. So the equation would be (96 +62) - (51 -25) =132. Let's verify: 96+62=158; 51-25=26; 158-26=132. Yes! So that uses all four numbers: 96,62,51,25. Each used once, with addition, subtraction, and parentheses. But I need to check if the operations are allowed. The problem says basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) can be used multiple times. So subtraction is allowed. So the equation is (96 + 62) - (51 - 25) =132. Let me check the arithmetic again. 96+62=158. 51-25=26. 158-26=132. Yep, that's correct. So this should be the answer.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(96 + 62) - (51 - 25) = 132</answer>"}]}

I need to make an equation using 57, 19, 37, and 54, each exactly once, with basic operations to get 666. Hmm. First, I should think about how to combine these numbers. Since 666 is a pretty large number, multiplication might be necessary. Let me check the sizes of the numbers. 57 is the largest, then 54, 37, and 19. Maybe multiply some of the bigger numbers together.\n\nLet's try 57 multiplied by something. 57 times 54 would be 57*54. Let me calculate that. 50*54 is 2700, and 7*54 is 378, so total 2700+378=3078. That's way too big. Maybe subtract something from that? But 3078 minus the other numbers (19 and 37) would still be way over. So maybe not multiplying 57 and 54 together.\n\nWhat if I subtract them first? 57-54=3, but that seems too small. Maybe 54 multiplied by another number. Let's see 54*19. That would be 1026. Hmm, then 1026 plus 57 and 37? 1026+57=1083, plus 37=1120. Still too low. Not close to 666. Wait, 1120 is more than 666. Wait, actually 54*19=1026, which is already over 666. So maybe subtract something from that. 1026 - 57 = 969, minus 37 is 932. Still not 666.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 54*37. Let's calculate that: 50*37=1850, plus 4*37=148, so 1850+148=1998. That's way too high. Maybe 1998 divided by something. 1998 divided by 3 is 666. But how do I get 3 from the remaining numbers 19 and 57? Wait, 57 divided by 19 is 3. Oh! That could work. So 54*37/(57/19) = 54*37/3. Let's check: 54*37 is 1998, divided by 3 is 666. Yes! So the equation would be (54 × 37) ÷ (57 ÷ 19) = 666. Let me verify each step again to make sure. \n\nFirst, 54 multiplied by 37: 54*37. Let's compute that again. 50*37=1850, 4*37=148, total 1850+148=1998. Then 57 divided by 19 is 3. So 1998 divided by 3 is indeed 666. And all numbers are used once: 54, 37, 57, 19. Yep, that works. So the equation is (54 * 37) / (57 / 19) = 666. Let me write that properly with parentheses. So the answer is (54*37)/(57/19) = 666.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(54 * 37) / (57 / 19) = 666</answer>"}]}

Maybe there's a way to factor some of these numbers to reach that. \n\nFirst, let's look at the numbers given. 288 is a large number. If I divide 288 by something to get closer to 256. 288 divided by 1.125 is 256, but how can I get 1.125 from the other numbers? Alternatively, maybe subtract something from 288. Let's see: 288 - 32 = 256. So if I can make 32 from 91, 10, and 49. Hmm. Let's check if 49 minus (91 divided by something) can help. Wait, 91 divided by 10 is 9.1, and 49 - 9.1 is 39.9, which isn't helpful. \n\nAlternatively, maybe 288 - (something) = 256. So 288 - 32 = 256. How can I get 32 from 91, 10, and 49. Let's see. 49 minus 17 is 32. But where would 17 come from? 91 and 10. 91 divided by 10 is 9.1, which doesn't help. Maybe 91 - 10 = 81. Then 81 minus 49 is 32. Wait, that could work. So 91 - 10 = 81, then 81 - 49 = 32. Then 288 - 32 = 256. So putting that together: 288 - (91 - 10 - 49) = 256. Let's check the calculation. Inside the parentheses: 91 - 10 is 81, then 81 - 49 is 32. Then 288 - 32 is 256. That works! So the equation would be 288 - (91 - 10 - 49) = 256. Wait, but I need to use all four numbers exactly once. Let me check if all numbers are used here. The numbers used would be 288, 91, 10, 49. Yes, all four. So that's correct. Let me verify again: 91 -10 -49 = 32, 288 -32 =256. Perfect.

Hmm, let's see. First, I should check if there are any obvious operations that could get close to 439. Let's look at the largest number here: 349. If I can somehow add or subtract the other numbers to 349 to reach 439, that might work.\n\n439 minus 349 is 90. So I need to get 90 from the remaining numbers: 36, 35, and 19. Wait, but I have three numbers left and I need to use them all. How can I combine 36, 35, and 19 to get 90? Let's think. Maybe 36 + 35 is 71, then 71 + 19 is 90. But that would require adding all three, but if I do that, then the equation would be 349 + 36 + 35 + 19. But wait, that sums to 349 + 36=385, 385+35=420, 420+19=439. Oh! Wait, that's exactly 439. But wait, the problem says I must use all the numbers and each only once. So if I add them all together: 349 + 36 + 35 + 19, does that work? Let me check. 349 + 36 is 385. 385 +35 is 420. 420 +19 is indeed 439. But the catch is that the problem says \"using the numbers 36, 35, 349, 19\" and creating an equation with arithmetic operations. If I just add them all, that's allowed, right? Because addition is a basic operation. But maybe the problem expects that we have to use operations between them, so perhaps multiple operations. Wait, the problem states: \"You can use basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) one or multiple times but each number can only be used once, and you must use all the numbers.\" So adding all the numbers together with plus signs is acceptable. Let me check: 349 + 36 + 35 + 19 = 439. Let me confirm:\n\n349 + 36 = 385\n\n385 + 35 = 420\n\n420 + 19 = 439. Yes, that's correct. But wait, does that use all four numbers? Yes. Each once. So the equation would be 349 + 36 + 35 + 19 = 439. But wait, maybe the problem expects that we have to use operations like multiplication or division as well, not just addition? Let me re-read the problem statement. The user says, \"You can use basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) one or multiple times but each number can only be used once, and you must use all the numbers.\" So it's allowed to use only addition, but maybe the problem expects a more complex equation, but maybe adding all together is the right answer. Let me check again. If that's allowed, then that's the simplest solution. But wait, maybe the user intended that you can't just add all numbers because that's straightforward, but perhaps the numbers are supposed to be combined with different operations. Let me verify if 349 +36 +35 +19 is allowed. Each number is used once, and all operations are additions. The problem says \"using the numbers... create an equation that equals 439. You can use basic arithmetic operations... one or multiple times but each number can only be used once.\" So adding all of them is allowed. Then that's the answer. But maybe I should check if that's the case. Let me see: 349 +36 is 385, plus 35 is 420, plus 19 is 439. So yes. So the equation is simply 349 + 36 + 35 + 19 = 439. So I can put that in the answer. But wait, the example given in the problem is like (1 + 2) / 3. So maybe the answer needs to have operations that combine the numbers in a more complex way. Wait, but if the straightforward addition works, then maybe that's acceptable. Let me make sure. Let me check the problem again. The problem says: \"create an equation that equals 439. You can use basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) one or multiple times but each number can only be used once, and you must use all the numbers.\" So adding all four numbers together is a valid equation. Therefore, the answer would be 349 + 36 + 35 + 19 = 439. But let me check if all numbers are used once: 349, 36, 35, 19. Yes. All four numbers, each once. So that's the answer. But maybe the problem expects some multiplication or division. Let me try to think if there's another way. For example, maybe 349 + (36 * something) or something. Let's see. Suppose I take 36 and 35. If I multiply them, 36*35=1260. That's way too big. 349 + 1260 would be over. So that's not helpful. What about 349 + (35 * something). Let's say 35*19 is 665. 349 +665 is 1014, way over. Hmm. Alternatively, 349 - (something) to get to 439. Wait, 349 is less than 439, so subtracting would take us further away. Maybe 349 * something. 349 * 1.25... but we have to use the given numbers. Let's see. Maybe 349 + 19 = 368. Then 368 + (35 * 36) would be way over. No. Alternatively, 35 * 19 = 665. Then 665 - 349 = 316. 316 +36=352. Not 439. Not helpful. Let's think of another approach. Maybe (349 - 35) = 314. Then 314 + 36 +19 = 369. Not enough. Or 349 - (35 -36) = 349 +1=350. Then 350 +19=369. Still not. How about 349 + (36 * (35 -19)). Let's compute 35-19=16. Then 36*16=576. 349+576=925. Too big. Alternatively, 349 + 36 * (35/19). Hmm, 35/19 is approximately 1.842. 36 times that is around 66.31. 349 +66.31≈415.31. Not enough. What if 349 + (35 * (36 -19)). Let's compute 36-19=17. 35*17=595. 349+595=944. Too big. Hmm. Maybe division. Let's see. Suppose I do 35/19=1.842... Then 36 * (35/19)=36*1.842≈66.31. Then 349 +66.31≈415.31. Still not 439. Alternatively, 349 +36=385. Then 385 + (35*19)=385+665=1050. No. Wait, maybe 349 + (36*35) -19. 36*35=1260. 349+1260=1609. 1609-19=1590. Way over. Not good. What if we do 349 - (36*35)/19. Let's calculate: 36*35=1260. 1260/19≈66.315. 349 -66.315≈282.685. Not helpful. Alternatively, 35*(349 -36)/19. Let's see: 349-36=313. 35*313=10,955. Divided by 19 is about 576.58. Not 439. Hmm. Maybe (349 -35) * (36/19). 349-35=314. 36/19≈1.8947. 314*1.8947≈595. Not 439. Alternatively, 349 +35=384. 384* (36/19). 36/19≈1.8947. 384*1.8947≈727. That's over. 349 +35* something. Wait, maybe 19*(36 - (349/35)). Let's see: 349/35≈9.971. 36-9.971≈26.029. 19*26.029≈494.55. Not 439. This isn't working. Let's try a different approach. Maybe using subtraction. Suppose we do 36*19=684. Then 684 - (349 -35)=684 -314=370. Not 439. Alternatively, 349 +35=384. 384 + (36-19)=384+17=401. Still not. What if 349 + (36* (19 - (35/ something))). Wait, but I need to use all numbers. Let's see. Maybe 349 + 36*(19 - (35/x)). But I have to use 35 somewhere else. Hmm, this seems complicated. Let's go back. Maybe the initial approach is correct. If adding all four numbers gives 439, then that's the answer. Let me check again: 349 +36=385, +35=420, +19=439. Yes. So 349 +36 +35 +19=439. All numbers used once, only addition operations. That seems to satisfy all the constraints. So maybe that's the answer. The problem didn't specify that we need to use all operations or anything, just that each number is used once and all numbers are used. So the equation is 349 +36 +35 +19=439. So I should put that as the answer.\n</think>\n\n<answer>349 + 36 + 35 + 19 = 439</answer>"}]}

Hmm, 504 is a pretty big number, so I probably need to multiply some of the larger numbers together. Let's see...\n\nFirst, 72 is already a big number. If I multiply 72 by 7, that gives me 504. Wait, 72 times 7 is exactly 504. Oh, that's promising! But then I have the two 5s left. The problem says I have to use all the numbers once. So I need to incorporate the 5s somehow without changing the result of 72*7=504. Maybe I can subtract and add them in a way that cancels out?\n\nLet's think. If I do 72 * 7 = 504, then maybe I can use the two 5s in a subtraction and addition that cancel each other. Like, 5 - 5 = 0, so adding or subtracting that from 504 would leave it the same. But how to structure that into an equation using all numbers once...\n\nAlternatively, maybe combine the 5s first. If I do 5 + 5 = 10. Then maybe 72 * 7 - (5 + 5)? But 72*7 is 504, so 504 -10 = 494, which is not 504. That's not helpful. Or 72*7 + (5 -5) = 504 +0 =504. But how to write that with the given numbers. Wait, but the requirement is to use each number once. So if I do 72 * 7 + (5 -5), that uses all numbers: 72,7,5,5. But subtraction and addition. So the equation would be (72 * 7) + (5 - 5) = 504. Let's check that: 72*7 is 504, and 5-5 is 0, so total is 504. That works, right? But wait, the problem allows using each number once. Let me confirm: 72, 7, 5, 5 are all used once each. Yes. So that equation would be valid. But I need to ensure that the operations are applied correctly. Let's write it as (72 × 7) + (5 - 5) = 504. That uses all numbers and the operations. Alternatively, maybe there's another way if that's not allowed. But according to the problem statement, as long as each number is used once, and all are used, it's okay. So this should work. Let me check again: 72 *7 is 504, then 5-5 is 0. Adding them gives 504. That's correct. So maybe that's the solution. But I need to make sure that using both 5s in a subtraction is acceptable. Since the numbers can be used once each, and the two 5s are each used once in the subtraction, that's allowed. So yeah, that works. Let me see if there's another possible way, but this seems straightforward. Alternatively, maybe (72 + 5) × (7 - 5), but 72+5 is 77, 7-5 is 2, 77*2=154. Not 504. How about 72 × (7 + 5) -5. Let's compute that: 7+5=12, 72×12=864, minus 5 is 859. Not 504. Hmm. Another approach: 5 divided by 5 is 1, then 72 ×7 ×1. That would be 504. So (72 ×7) × (5 /5) = 504. Because 5/5 is 1. That's another way. Let's check: 72*7 is 504, multiplied by (5/5)=1, so 504. That uses all numbers once. That's also a valid solution. Which one is better? The problem allows any operations, so both are possible. The question is, which one is the correct answer? Let me check if both are acceptable. For instance, (72×7) × (5÷5) is another way. Alternatively, the problem might prefer minimal operations, but the user didn't specify. Either equation should work. Let me see which one is more straightforward. The first way adds 5-5, which is zero, while the second multiplies by 5/5 which is one. Both are valid. Let me check the problem statement again: it says to return the equation in the answer tags. Either is acceptable. However, maybe using division instead of subtraction. Let's verify if both equations are correct. Yes. So which one to choose? Let's pick the division one because it's a single operation between the two 5s instead of subtraction and addition. Wait, no, 5/5 is division once. So in terms of operations, maybe that's better. So the equation would be 72 × 7 × (5 ÷ 5). Let's compute: 5 divided by 5 is 1. 72×7=504, multiplied by 1 is 504. So yes. That's another correct equation. So which one to present? The problem might consider that using division is more efficient, but since both are correct, perhaps either is okay. Let me check if the problem allows parentheses. Yes, the example uses parentheses. So either equation would work. But the user might prefer the division approach. Let me think: since the problem states that each number must be used once and all numbers must be used, both equations use all numbers. The first equation uses + and -, and the second uses × and ÷. Either is acceptable. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe there's another way. Let me try to explore. What if we do 72 - 5 = 67, then 67 ×7 = 469, then 469 +5=474. Not helpful. Or 5 ×7 =35, then 35 +72=107, 107 ×5=535. 535 is less than 504, no. Another idea: 72 × (5 + 5 +7). Let's compute 5+5+7=17. 72×17=1224. That's way too big. How about 72 ×7 =504, then 5/5=1, so 504 ×1=504. So that's the same as the division approach. So yeah. So the equation would be (72 ×7) × (5 ÷5) =504. Alternatively, it could be written as 72 ×7 ×5 ÷5. Since multiplication and division are from left to right, but in this case, 72×7 is 504, then ×5 is 2520, then ÷5 is 504 again. So that's another way. But does that use each number once? Let's see: 72 is used once, 7 once, 5 twice. Wait, but in that case, 5 is used twice (once multiplied, once divided). But according to the problem, each number can only be used once. So in this case, writing 72 ×7 ×5 ÷5 would be using 5 twice, but we have two 5s. Wait, the original numbers are 5,5,72,7. So each 5 is used once. So in the equation 72 ×7 ×5 ÷5, the two 5s are used once each. So that's allowed. Because you have two 5s, each used once. So that's acceptable. So that's another valid equation. So 72 ×7 ×5 ÷5 =504. Let's confirm: 72×7=504. Then 504×5=2520. Then 2520 ÷5=504. Correct. So that uses all numbers: 72,7,5,5. Each once. So that's valid. So maybe that's the equation. Alternatively, the problem might prefer parentheses to group the 5÷5, but that's a style choice. So either form is acceptable. But I need to check if the problem requires using each digit exactly once. Since there are two 5s, they need to be used once each. So in the equation 72 ×7 ×5 ÷5, that uses each 5 once. So that works. Therefore, the equation can be written as 72 ×7 ×5 ÷5 =504. Alternatively, using parentheses: 72 ×7 ×(5 ÷5) =504. Either is correct. So perhaps the answer is (72 * 7) * (5 / 5) = 504. Alternatively, without the parentheses, but according to order of operations, multiplication and division are equal and left to right, so 72 ×7 ×5 ÷5 would evaluate as ((72×7)×5)÷5 = (504×5)÷5 =2520 ÷5=504. But both forms are correct. The user's example used parentheses, so maybe using them is preferred. Let me go with the equation that uses parentheses to group the 5/5. So (72 * 7) * (5 / 5) = 504. That way, it's clear that the two 5s are used in their own operation. So that's the equation. Let me verify once more. 5 divided by 5 is 1. 72 multiplied by 7 is 504. 504 multiplied by 1 is 504. Perfect. That uses all the numbers once. Yes, that works. I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(72 * 7) * (5 / 5) = 504</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using all four numbers: 49, 72, 74, and 66, each exactly once, with basic operations to get 129. Hmm. Let me start by thinking about possible combinations.\n\nFirst, maybe I should see if adding some numbers gets close. Let's check the sums. If I add 72 and 66, that's 138. Hmm, 138 is a bit higher than 129. If I subtract something from that. Let's see, 138 minus 9 is 129. Wait, do I have a 9? Not directly, but maybe using division or multiplication. Alternatively, 74 minus 49 is 25. Maybe that's useful. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps multiplying some numbers. For example, 72 divided by something. 72 divided by 66 would give a fraction, which might not be helpful. What about 74 - (49 + something) = 129? Wait, that would require the something to be a negative number, which might not work. Let me try different approaches.\n\nWait, maybe combine 74 and 49 first. 74 minus 49 is 25. Then, if I can make 25 plus something else using 72 and 66. Let's see, 72 minus 66 is 6. So 25 + 6 is 31, which isn't close. Hmm. Maybe 72 divided by something. 72 divided by (66 - 49) is 72/17, which is about 4.23. Then adding that to 74 would be 78.23, which is not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe using multiplication. Let's see, 74 + 66 = 140. Then 140 minus something. 140 minus 11 is 129. How to get 11 from 49 and 72. 72 - 49 = 23. That's too much. 72 divided by something? 72 divided by (66 - 49) is 72/17 ≈4.23. Then 140 - 4.23 is about 135.77. Not close.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 72 - (66 / something). If I divide 66 by 49, that's around 1.346. Then 72 minus 1.346 is 70.654. Not helpful. Maybe 72 * (66/49). That would be (72*66)/49. Let's calculate: 72*66 is 4752. Divided by 49 is about 96.98. Then adding 74 would be 96.98 +74=170.98. No.\n\nHmm, maybe subtract two large numbers and add the others. For example, 74 +72 =146. Then 146 - (66 -49). Wait, 66-49 is 17. So 146 -17=129. Wait, that works! Let me check: 74 +72 =146. Then subtract (66 -49)=17. So 146 -17=129. Yes! Let me verify the numbers: 74,72,66,49. All used once. The equation would be 74 +72 - (66 -49) =129. But let's make sure the order is correct with parentheses. So (74 +72) - (66 -49) = 146 -17=129. That's correct. So the equation is (74 +72) - (66 -49) =129.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(74 + 72) - (66 - 49) = 129</answer>"}]}

Let me start by thinking about the target number, 811. It's a prime number, I think, so factoring might not be helpful here. Maybe I need to combine the numbers in a way that involves addition and subtraction, or perhaps multiplication and division. Let me try different combinations.\n\nFirst, let's note the numbers: 96, 52, 78, 667. The largest number here is 667. Maybe if I subtract something from 667 to get close to 811. Wait, 667 is less than 811, so subtracting would take me further away. Maybe add something to 667. Let's see: 667 + something. Let's check what's left: 96, 52, 78. If I add 96 + 52 + 78, that's 96+52=148, 148+78=226. 667 + 226 = 893. That's over 811 by 82. Hmm. So that's too much. Maybe I need to use multiplication or division to adjust.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use 667 as a base and add or subtract combinations of the other numbers. Let's try 667 + 96 = 763. Then we have 52 and 78 left. 763 + 52 = 815, which is 815. Then 815 +78=893 again. Not helpful. Alternatively, 667 + 96 + 52 = 667+96=763, +52=815. Then 815 +78=893, same as before. Still over.\n\nWait, 811 is 667 + 144. So can I get 144 from 96, 52, 78? Let's see. 96 + 52 = 148. 148 - 4 = 144. But how do I get 4 from 78? 78 divided by something? 78 / 19.5 is 4, but that's not an integer. Alternatively, 52 + 78 = 130. 130 + 96 = 226. Still not 144.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 96 * something. Let's see, 96 * 1.5 = 144. But how to get 1.5 from 52 and 78? 78/52 = 1.5. Oh! Wait, 78 divided by 52 is exactly 1.5. So maybe 96*(78/52) = 96*1.5 = 144. Then 667 + 144 = 811. Let's check that. So 78 divided by 52 is 1.5. 96 multiplied by 1.5 is 144. Then 667 + 144 is 811. That works! Let me verify each step:\n\n78 ÷ 52 = 1.5. Then 96 × 1.5 = 144. Then 667 + 144 = 811. So the equation would be 667 + 96 × (78 ÷ 52) = 811. Let me check the order of operations: division and multiplication first. So 78 ÷52 is first, which is 1.5, then 96 ×1.5 is 144, then 667 +144 is 811. Perfect! But wait, are all the numbers used exactly once? Let's see: 667, 96, 78, 52. Yes, all four numbers are used once each. The operations are +, ×, ÷. So this should work.\n\nBut let me just write it out properly with parentheses to ensure correct order. So the equation would be 667 + (96 × (78 ÷ 52)) = 811. Let's compute:\n\nFirst, 78 ÷52 = 1.5.\n\nThen 96 ×1.5 = 144.\n\nThen 667 +144 = 811. Exactly.

But how to get those numbers from the given ones. Let's check the numbers again: 272, 43, 232, 58. Let's see if there's a way to pair them or combine them.\n\nLet me try adding some of them. 272 + 43 is 315, and 232 + 58 is 290. 315 + 290 is way more than 403. That's not helpful.

The operations allowed are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I should check what 828 is divisible by. Let me factorize 828. Dividing by 2 gives 414, again by 2 is 207. Then 207 divided by 3 is 69, again by 3 is 23. So 828 = 2×2×3×3×23. But I don't have 23 in the numbers. Alternatively, maybe I can find a combination that multiplies to 828.\n\nLooking at the numbers given: 43 and 49 are both in the 40s, which are pretty large. 9 is a single digit, and 1 is small. Maybe multiplying the two big numbers? Let's try 43 × 49. Let's calculate that. 43 × 49: 40×40=1600, 40×9=360, 3×40=120, 3×9=27. So (40+3)(40+9) = 1600 + 360 + 120 +27 = 1600+360=1960; 1960+120=2080; 2080+27=2107. That's way bigger than 828. So that's too much.\n\nWhat if we subtract? 49 - 43 = 6. Then 6 × something. But 828 divided by 6 is 138. So we need to get 138 from 1 and 9. That seems tough. 9 -1=8, but 138 is 17.25 times 8. Not helpful. Alternatively, 9* (1 something). Maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, let's see 43 × 19. Wait, but we don't have 19. We have 1 and 9. So 43 × (9 + 1) = 43 ×10=430. Then 430 × something. But we have to use all numbers. Wait, but 430 is using 43 and 1 and 9? No, 9+1 is 10. So that uses 43,9,1. Then we still have 49 left. 430 ×49 would be way too big. So that's not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe 49 multiplied by something. 49 ×17=833, which is close to 828. How to get 17? Using 9,1,43? Hmm. 9 +1=10, 43-10=33. Not helpful. Or 43 - (9+1)=33. Still not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 49 × (something) minus 43 × something else. Let's see. 828 is 49×16.89... Maybe not the best approach.\n\nWait, 828 divided by 43 is approximately 19.255. So maybe 43 multiplied by something equals 828. Let's check 828 ÷43. 43×19= 817, 43×19.255 is 828. So 19.255 is 19 + 0.255. Hmm, but we need to use 49, 1, 9. Maybe 49 divided by (something) to get around 19.255. Wait, 49 divided by (9 -1) is 49/8=6.125. Not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, let's think of combining 49 and 43 with other operations. For example, 49 +43=92. Then 92 × something. 828 ÷92=9. So 92 ×9=828. Wait, but we have to use all numbers. So 49 +43=92, multiplied by 9. But then we still have the 1 left. Oh, right, we need to use all numbers. So this approach would use 49,43,9 but leaves out 1. So we need to include the 1 somehow.\n\nAlternatively, adjust that. Maybe 49 +43=92, then 92 × (9 -1) =92×8=736. That's not 828. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, 49 × (43 - (9 +1))=49×(43-10)=49×33=1617. That's way too big. Not helpful.\n\nWhat if we do 43 × (9 × (something with 49 and 1)). Let's see. Let me think. 9 × (49 -1) =9×48=432. Then 43 ×432 is way over.\n\nAlternatively, maybe subtract. 49 ×9 =441. 441 × something. 441 ×2=882. Not 828. 441 - something. 441 - (43 ×1)=441-43=398. No.\n\nWait, 49 ×9 =441. Then 828 -441=387. Now need to get 387 from 43 and 1. 43 ×9=387, but 9 is already used. Wait, can't use numbers more than once. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, 43 ×9 =387. Then 387 + something =828. 828 -387=441. 441 is 49×9. But again, 9 is used twice. Not allowed.\n\nAlternatively, 43 × (something) +49 × (something). Let's see. Suppose 43 × a +49 ×b =828, where a and b are combinations of 9 and 1. But 9 and 1 can be used once. So possible a and b could be 9 and 1, but how? For example, 43×9 +49×1= 387 +49=436. Not 828. 43×1 +49×9=43+441=484. No. Hmm.\n\nAnother approach: 828 is 9*92. So maybe need to get 92 from 43,49,1. Let's see. 49 +43=92. Then 92*9=828. But that uses 49,43,9. But leaves out 1. How to incorporate the 1? Maybe 49 +43 +1=93, which isn't 92. Alternatively, 49 +43 -1=91. 91*9=819. Close but not 828. Alternatively, 49 +43=92. Then 92*(9+1)=920. No. Or 92*(9-1)=736. No.\n\nWait, maybe the 1 is used in division. For example, (49 +43) * (9 /1)=92*9=828. Oh! Wait, 9 divided by 1 is 9. So (49 +43) * (9 /1)=92*9=828. That uses all numbers: 49,43,9,1. Let me check: 49+43=92, 9/1=9, then 92*9=828. Yes! That works. But does this use each number exactly once? 49,43,9,1—all used. Yes. So the equation would be (49 +43) × (9 /1) =828. But let me verify the calculation: 49+43=92. 9 divided by 1 is 9. 92 multiplied by 9: 90*9=810, 2*9=18, so 810+18=828. Exactly. So that works. So the equation is (49 +43) * (9 / 1) =828. That uses all numbers once with each operation.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(43 + 49) * (9 / 1)</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using the numbers 73, 800, 53, and 25, each exactly once, with basic operations to get 755. Hmm. Let's start by looking at the target number, 755. It's close to 800, so maybe subtracting something from 800 could work. 800 minus 45 is 755. Do I have numbers that can make 45? Let's check the other numbers: 73, 53, 25. If I subtract 73 and 53, that's 126, which is too big. Wait, maybe combining them in another way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 53 minus 25 is 28. If I subtract that from 800, that's 800 - 28 = 772. Not 755. Hmm. Maybe using multiplication. Let's think: 73 * something. 73 times 10 is 730. 755 minus 730 is 25. Oh, so maybe 73*10 +25, but where do I get 10 from? The numbers left would be 800 and 53. Wait, 800 divided by 53 is roughly 15.09, which isn't helpful. Maybe 53 divided by something. Hmm.\n\nWait, another approach: 25 times something. 25*30 is 750, which is close. Then I need 5 more. So 25*30 +5. But how to get 30 and 5 from the remaining numbers. Let's see. The numbers are 73, 800, 53. If I take 800 divided by 25 is 32, but 25 is already used. Wait, no. Wait, 25 is part of the equation. Maybe 53 - 23 = 30. But where do I get 23 from?\n\nAlternatively, maybe 800 - (73 - (53/25)). Let me compute that. 53 divided by 25 is 2.12. 73 - 2.12 is 70.88. 800 -70.88 is 729.12, which is not 755. Doesn't work.\n\nWait, maybe 800 - (73 -53) * something. 73-53 is 20. 20 * something. If I multiply 20 by 25, that's 500. 800 -500 is 300. Not helpful. If I do 800 - (20 * something) to get 755, then 800 -755=45. So 20 * x =45, so x=2.25. But can I get 2.25 from the remaining number? The remaining numbers are 25 and 53. Wait, 53 divided by 25 is 2.12, which is close but not exactly. So that might not work.\n\nWhat if I try adding instead? Let's see. 73 +53=126. 800 -126=674. Then 674 +25=699. Not 755. Hmm. Maybe 800 + something. 800 + (73* something). Let's see, 73*5=365. 800+365=1165. That's way over. 73* (53 -25) =73*28=2044. 800+2044=2844. Nope.\n\nAnother angle: 53*25=1325. If I subtract 800 from that, 1325-800=525. Then 525 +73=598. Not helpful. Alternatively, 53*25 +73 = 1325+73=1398. 1398 -800=598. Still not 755.\n\nWait, maybe using division. 800 divided by 25 is 32. Then 32* something. 32*23=736. 736 +53=789. Not enough. Or 32*24=768. 768 -13=755. But where to get 13? Maybe 73-60, but I don't have 60. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, 800 / 25 =32. Then 32*23.59375=755. But that's not helpful with integers.\n\nWait, maybe 73 * (53 -25) + something. 53-25=28. 73*28=2044. Then 2044 - 800=1244. No, not close. \n\nWait, perhaps 73 * 10 =730. 730 +25=755. So how do I get 10 from 800 and 53? 800 divided by 53 is approximately 15.09. Not 10. What if 53 - (800 /25). Wait, 800/25=32. So 53-32=21. Then 21 * something. Hmm.\n\nWait, 25 multiplied by 53 is 1325. Then 1325 - 73 = 1252. 1252 -800=452. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe (800 - 73) = 727. Then 727 + something. 755 -727=28. So need 28. How to get 28 from 53 and 25. 53 -25=28. Yes! So 800 -73 =727, then 727 + (53 -25) =727 +28=755. Let's check: 800 -73 =727; 53 -25=28; 727 +28=755. Yes! But I need to use all numbers once. So the equation would be (800 -73) + (53 -25) =755. Let's check: 800-73=727, 53-25=28, 727+28=755. That works! And all numbers are used once: 800,73,53,25. Perfect.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(800 - 73) + (53 - 25) = 755</answer>"}]}

Hmm, let's see. Let me start by thinking about how these numbers can combine. \n\nFirst, 63 is a bit less than 66, which is 2*33. But I don't have a 2 here. Wait, maybe I can subtract something from 33? Let's see, 33 is one of the numbers. If I take 33 and do something with it. 33 times 2 would be 66, but again, no 2. Alternatively, 33 plus 30 is 63. But 30 isn't directly available. Wait, maybe 33 plus (23 - 3) is 33 + 20 = 53, which is not enough.\n\nAlternatively, maybe multiply some numbers. 46 is a bigger number. If I use 46, perhaps subtract something from it. 46 minus (something) equals 63? That's not possible because 46 is less than 63. So maybe adding 46 and another number? 46 + 33 = 79, which is more than 63. 46 + 23 = 69, still more. 46 + 3 = 49. Hmm. \n\nWhat if I do 46 plus 23 minus something. 46 +23 is 69. 69 minus 6 is 63. But how do I get 6 from the remaining numbers? The remaining numbers would be 33 and 3. 33 divided by 3 is 11. Not 6. 33 minus 3 is 30. Not helpful. So that path might not work.\n\nWait, maybe 33 multiplied by something. 33*2=66, but I don't have 2. 33* (3) is 99. That's way too big. 23*3=69. Then 69 minus something. 69 -6=63. But 6 from where? 46 and 33 are left. 46-33=13. Not 6. Hmm.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Let's list possible combinations. Maybe using division. For example, 46 divided by something. 46 divided by 3 is about 15.333. Not sure. 23 divided by 3 is around 7.666. 33 divided by 3 is 11. Maybe 46 - (33/3) =46-11=35. Not 63. \n\nHow about combining 23 and 3 first. 23 -3=20. Then 46 +20=66. 66 -33=33. Not helpful. Wait, that gives 33, which is one of the numbers, but we need 63.\n\nAlternatively, 23*3=69. Then 69 - (something)=63. 69-6=63. So how to get 6 from 46 and 33? 46-33=13. Not 6. 33-46=negative. Not helpful. 46+33=79. 79- something? Not sure. \n\nWhat if I do 33 + (23 -3) =33+20=53. Then 53 +10=63. But where's 10? 46-36=10, but we don't have 36. Alternatively, 46 divided by something. 46/4.6=10, but 4.6 isn't available. \n\nWait another angle: 63 is 9*7. But I don't see how to get 9 and 7 from the numbers. Or 21*3. 21 is 23-2, but again, no 2. Hmm.\n\nLet me try using all four numbers with different operations. Maybe 46 - 23 =23. Then 33 +3=36. 23 +36=59. Not 63. Not helpful.\n\nWhat about 46 -3=43. Then 33 +23=56. 43 +56=99. Too big. \n\nWait, 46 +23=69. 69 minus something. 69 -6=63. So 69 - (33 /3)=69 -11=58. No. Not 6. Alternatively, 33 - (3* something). If I use 3* (something) to get 6. But how? 3*2=6, but no 2. 3*(46-23)=3*23=69. 69 -33=36. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 46 divided by something. 46 divided by (3) is around 15.333. Then 33 -15.333=17.666. Then 17.666 +23=40.6. Not 63.\n\nWait, maybe multiply two numbers. Let's see, 23*3=69. Then 69 - (something) =63. So 6. But how to get 6 from 46 and 33. 46 -33=13. 33-46=-13. 46+33=79. 79- something? Maybe 79 - (something else). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, 46 +33=79. Then 79 -16=63. How to get 16 from 23 and3. 23 - (3)=20. Not 16. 23/3 is about 7.666. 23 - (3* something). 3*5=15, so 23 -15=8. Not 16. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe using division and subtraction. For example, 33 divided by 3 is 11. Then 46 +23=69. 69 -11=58. Not 63.\n\nWait, another combination: 46 - (33 -23) =46 -10=36. Then 36 * (3) =108. Not helpful. Or 36 +3=39.\n\nWhat if I do (46 + 23) + (33 /3) =69 +11=80. No.\n\nAlternatively, (33 + 23) =56. 56 + (46 /3) ≈56 +15.333=71.333. Not 63.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Let me try different combinations. Maybe using subtraction and addition.\n\nWait, 46 +33=79. 79 -23=56. 56 -3=53. Not 63. \n\nHow about 33*3=99. Then 99 -46=53. 53 +23=76. No.\n\nWait, 23*3=69. Then 69 - (46 -33). 46-33=13. 69-13=56. Close but no.\n\nAlternatively, 46 + (33 -23) =46+10=56. 56 + (3) =59. Not 63.\n\nWait, maybe 33 + (46 -23 -3). 46-23=23. 23-3=20. 33+20=53. Not 63.\n\nAnother approach: 63 can be 46 + 17. So how to get 17 from 33,23,3. 33 - (23 -3)=33-20=13. Not 17. 23 - (33/3)=23-11=12. No. 33/3=11. 23-11=12. Still not.\n\nHmm, maybe 23 + (46 -33) =23+13=36. 36 * (3) =108. No. Or 36 +3=39. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, (46 -3) =43. Then 43 +23=66. 66 -33=33. Not 63.\n\nWait, perhaps (33 * 3) - (46 +23). 99 -69=30. No.\n\nWhat if I do 46 * 3 =138. Then 138 -33=105. 105 -23=82. Not 63.\n\nOr 46 * (3 - (33/23)). Wait, that's getting too complicated. Let me check: 33/23 is roughly 1.434. 3 -1.434=1.566. 46*1.566≈72. Not exact, and we have to use integers and exact operations. Probably not the way to go.\n\nWait, maybe (23 - 3) =20. Then 46 +20=66. 66 - (33 / something). 33 divided by 1 is 33. 66 -33=33. Not helpful. Or 33 divided by 3 is 11. 66-11=55. No.\n\nHmm, maybe reverse the operations. Like 63 is 3*21. Can I make 21 from 46,33,23. 46-23=23. 23 + (33/3)=23+11=34. Not 21. 33 - (46/23)=33-2=31. Then 31*3=93. Not helpful.\n\nWait, 46 divided by 23 is 2. Then 2*33=66. 66 -3=63. Oh! Wait, that's possible. Let me check. 46 /23=2. Then 2 *33=66. 66 -3=63. That uses all four numbers: 46,23,33,3. Each exactly once. Let me verify:\n\n46 ÷23 = 2\n\n2 ×33 =66\n\n66 -3=63\n\nYes, that works. So the equation would be (46 / 23) * 33 - 3 =63. Let's compute step by step to confirm:\n\nFirst, 46 divided by 23 is 2.\n\nThen, 2 multiplied by 33 is 66.\n\n66 minus 3 equals 63.\n\nYes, exactly. So the equation is (46 / 23) * 33 - 3 =63. All numbers used once, and correct operations.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(46 / 23) * 33 - 3 = 63</answer>"}]}

I need to use the numbers 79, 15, 16, and 100 exactly once each with basic arithmetic operations to get 22. Hmm. Let me start by thinking about possible combinations.\n\nFirst, maybe subtract some numbers. 100 is a big number; if I subtract something from 100, maybe that gets me closer. For example, 100 - 79 = 21. Then I have 15 and 16 left. How can I get from 21 to 22 using 15 and 16? Maybe add 1? But how to get 1 from 15 and 16. Wait, 16 - 15 = 1. So if I do 100 - 79 + (16 - 15), that would be 21 + 1 = 22. Let me check: 100 - 79 is 21, 16-15 is 1, adding them gives 22. But wait, that uses all numbers: 100,79,16,15. Yes. So the equation would be (100 - 79) + (16 - 15) = 22. Let me verify: 100-79=21, 16-15=1, 21+1=22. That works. But does that use all the numbers once? Yep, 100,79,16,15. All used once. So that's a possible solution.\n\nWait, but maybe there's another way. Let me think again to ensure there's not a simpler or different equation. For example, using multiplication or division. Let's see. 79 is a prime number, so maybe not easy to divide. 16 and 15 are close. Maybe 16 divided by something. Let's see: 16 divided by (something) plus or minus others. If I take 79 minus 15, that's 64. Then 100 divided by something. Wait, 100 divided by (something). 64 is 16*4. Maybe 100 divided by (16 - something). Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe 100/16 is 6.25, but adding that to 79-15=64 would be too big. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 79 - (15 + 16) = 79 -31=48. Then 48 + something to reach 22? No, that's in the wrong direction. What if I subtract that from 100? 100 -48=52. Not 22.\n\nAlternatively, 79 - 16=63, 100-63=37, then 37 -15=22. Wait, that works. Let me check: 79-16=63, 100-63=37, 37-15=22. So the equation would be (100 - (79 -16)) -15 = 22. Let's parse that. 79-16=63. 100-63=37. 37-15=22. That uses all numbers: 100,79,16,15. So that's another possible equation. So two possible solutions here.\n\nWait, so which one is better? The first one is adding and subtracting, the second uses parentheses differently. Both are valid. Let me check if the second one is allowed. The equation would be (100 - (79 - 16)) - 15. Breaking it down: 79-16=63, 100-63=37, 37-15=22. Yes. So that's another valid way.\n\nSo there are at least two equations here. The first one is (100 -79) + (16 -15)=22. The second is (100 - (79 -16)) -15=22. Either would work. But the problem asks to return the equation in the answer tags. The user probably expects one correct answer. Let me check if both are correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe another approach: using division. Let's see. For example, 16 divided by something. If I do 100 divided by something. Let's see: 100 / (15 + 16/79). Wait, that's using division but fractions. But 16/79 is a fraction, which complicates things. Not sure if that would result in an integer. Alternatively, maybe (79 -15) * (16 / 100). Let's compute that: 64 * 0.16=10.24. Not 22.\n\nAnother idea: 79 - (100 / (16 -15)). Let's see: 16-15=1. 100/1=100. 79-100=-21. Not 22. Close, but negative.\n\nAlternatively, (100 -16) / (15) + something. 84 /15 is 5.6. 79 - that would be 73.4. Not helpful.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, 79 - (100 +15)/16. Let's compute: 115/16=7.1875. 79 -7.1875=71.8125. Not 22.\n\nAlternatively, (100 +16) - (79 +15). That's 116 -94=22. Oh! That's even simpler. Wait, 100 +16 =116, 79 +15=94. 116-94=22. So the equation would be (100 +16) - (79 +15)=22. Let me check: 100+16=116, 79+15=94. 116-94=22. Yes! That uses all four numbers once each with addition and subtraction. That's a much simpler equation. How did I not think of that earlier. So that's another solution.\n\nSo now I have three possible equations:\n\n1. (100 -79) + (16 -15) =22\n2. (100 - (79 -16)) -15=22\n3. (100 +16) - (79 +15)=22\n\nAll of them are valid. The third one is the simplest, using only addition and subtraction without nested parentheses. Let me check again. 100+16=116, 79+15=94, 116-94=22. Correct. So why didn't I think of that first? Because sometimes the obvious solution is the simplest. So the answer would be (100 +16) - (79 +15) =22. Or written as 100 +16 -79 -15=22, but using parentheses to group the additions first.\n\nSo the problem requires using all numbers exactly once and basic operations. All three equations do that, but the third one is the most straightforward. So the answer is (100 + 16) - (79 + 15) =22. Let me check again: 100+16=116, 79+15=94, 116-94=22. Perfect.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(100 + 16) - (79 + 15) = 22</answer>"}]}

I need to use all the numbers 95, 88, 2, and 19 exactly once each, combining them with basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) to get 166. Hmm. Let's start by thinking about possible combinations.\n\nFirst, maybe I can look for numbers that can multiply to get close. Let's see, 95 and 2. If I multiply them, that's 190. Then maybe subtract something. 190 minus... what's left? 88 and 19. Wait, 88 minus 19 is 69. Hmm, 190 - 69 is 121. Not enough.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 95 plus 88. That's 183. Then subtract something. 183 minus 19 is 164. Close. But we have a 2 left. 164 minus 2 is 162. No. Or maybe 183 - (19*2). 19*2 is 38. 183-38=145. Still not 166.\n\nWait, what if I do 95 + (88/2). Let's calculate 88 divided by 2 is 44. 95 +44 is 139. Then add 19? 139+19=158. No. Hmm. Not there.\n\nWhat if I use multiplication with 19 and 2. 19*2=38. Then maybe 95 +88=183. 183 -38=145. Still not. \n\nAlternatively, 88*2=176. Then 176 plus something. 176 +19=195. Then subtract 95? 195-95=100. Nope. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe 95 -19=76. Then 76*2=152. Then add 88? 152+88=240. Too high. Not good.\n\nAnother approach: let's think of 166. It's close to 160, so maybe 88 + something. 88 + 78=166. How to get 78 from the remaining numbers 95, 2, 19. Hmm. 95 -19=76. 76 +2=78. So 88 + (95 -19 +2). But wait, I have to use all numbers once. Wait, that would use 88,95,19,2. So 88 + (95 -19 +2) = 88 +78=166. Wait, but the operations here are 95-19=76, then 76+2=78, then 88+78=166. But the problem is that each number is used once, but the operations would be (95 -19 +2). Wait, that's using 95,19,2. Then adding 88. But the way to write the equation would be 88 +95 -19 +2. Let's check that: 88+95=183, 183-19=164, 164+2=166. Oh! Wait, that works. Because 88 +95 is 183, minus 19 is 164, plus 2 is 166. And all numbers are used once. So that would be (88 + 95) -19 +2 = 166. Wait, but parentheses aren't necessary. So the equation is 88 +95 -19 +2 = 166. Let me check that: 88 +95 is 183, minus 19 is 164, plus 2 is 166. Yes! That's correct. Oh, so maybe that's the answer. Let me verify once more. The numbers used are 88,95,19,2. All used once. The operations are +, -, +. So that's allowed. So the equation would be 88 +95 -19 +2 =166. But maybe written with parentheses for clarity, like (88 +95) -19 +2, but the parentheses aren't necessary since addition and subtraction are left associative. So yeah, that seems to work. But wait, let me check if there's another way. Maybe using multiplication or division. Let's see. For example, 19*2=38. Then 95 +88=183. 183 -38=145. No. Not helpful. Alternatively, 95*2=190. Then subtract 88/19. Wait, 88 divided by 19 is about 4.63. 190 -4.63 is around 185.37. Not close. Hmm. Alternatively, 88*2=176. Then 176 -19=157. Then 157 +95=252. Nope. Not helpful. Another approach: 95 - (88 / (19 -2)). Let's see. 19-2=17. 88/17≈5.176. 95 -5.176≈89.824. Not close. Hmm. Maybe 95 + (88 -19)*2. Let's calculate 88-19=69. 69*2=138. 95 +138=233. No. Not 166. Alternatively, (95 -88) *19 +2. 95-88=7. 7*19=133. 133+2=135. Nope. Hmm. So maybe the first approach is better. The straightforward way: 88 +95 -19 +2. That gives exactly 166. Let me confirm again. 88+95=183, 183-19=164, 164+2=166. Yes. So that works. So the equation is 88 + 95 - 19 + 2 = 166. All numbers used once, operations are +, -, +. So this should be the answer. I think that's the correct one.\n</think>\n\n<answer>88 + 95 - 19 + 2 = 166</answer>"}]}

Each number can only be used once, and I can use basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division. Hmm.\n\nFirst, maybe I should look at the target number, 187, and see if there are any obvious relationships with the given numbers. Let me list the numbers again: 23, 70, 194, 40.\n\nLooking at 194, that's a big number. Maybe subtract something from it? 194 minus what? Let's see. 194 - 7 = 187. Wait, but 7 isn't in the numbers. Alternatively, maybe 194 - (something that equals 7). But the numbers available are 23, 70, 40. Hmm. 70 divided by 10 is 7, but 10 isn't here. Wait, maybe 70 divided by 10 is 7, but 10 isn't one of the numbers. Alternatively, 23 - 16 is 7, but again, 16 isn't here. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 194 divided by something. 194 divided by 1.04 (approx) is 187, but that's not helpful. Maybe that's not the right approach.\n\nLet me think of other numbers. 70 and 40. 70 + 40 is 110. 23 is left. 110 +23=133, which is less than 187. Maybe not. Alternatively, 70 * 40 is 2800, which is way too big. 70 - 40 is 30. Then 30 +23=53. Still way off.\n\nWait, 70 and 194. 194 -70 is 124. Then 124 +40=164. 164 +23=187. Oh, wait! That adds up. Let's check: 194 -70 = 124. Then 124 +40 = 164. Then 164 +23=187. But wait, that uses all numbers: 194-70+40+23. But does the order matter? Let me compute: 194 -70 is 124. 124 +40 is 164. 164 +23 is 187. Yes, that works. But the problem requires using each number once and all numbers. So that equation would be 194 -70 +40 +23 =187. But let's check if all operations are allowed. Since addition and subtraction are allowed, and all numbers are used once. But wait, the problem says \"create an equation\" but perhaps the user expects parentheses or a specific order. Let me verify.\n\nAlternatively, maybe grouping them as (194 -70) + (40 +23). Let's compute that: 124 +63=187. Yes. So the equation would be (194 -70) + (40 +23) =187. That uses all numbers once with addition and subtraction. So that's a possible solution.\n\nBut wait, are there other ways? Let me check. Maybe another combination. Let's see: 23 * 8 = 184, which is close to 187. But 8 isn't here. 23*7=161. Hmm. 70 divided by 40 is 1.75. Not helpful. 194 -23=171. Then 171 + something. 171 +16=187. But 16 isn't there. Wait, 40 -70= -30. Then 194 - (-30) would be 224, which is too big. Maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, 70 * (something) plus or minus others. Let's see: 70*2=140. 140 +47=187. But 47 isn't here. 70*3=210. 210-23=187. But that uses 70*3 (but 3 isn't a number here). So that's not possible.\n\nWait, 40*4=160. 160+27=187. Again, 27 is not present. Maybe 23 + 194=217. 217 - 30=187. 30 can be 70 -40. So 217 - (70 -40) =217 -30=187. Let me check: 23 +194 =217. Then subtract (70 -40)=30. So 217 -30=187. But the numbers used would be 23,194,70,40. All used once. So the equation would be (23 +194) - (70 -40) =187. Let me verify: 23+194=217. 70-40=30. 217-30=187. Yes, that works. And this uses all numbers once, with subtraction and addition. Also, the parentheses are necessary here. So this is another possible solution.\n\nSo there are two possible equations here: either (194 -70) + (40 +23) =187 or (23 +194) - (70 -40)=187. Both are valid, but perhaps the second one is more efficient in terms of operations. Let me check if there's any other way.\n\nAnother approach: 194 divided by something. 194/1.04=186.5, which is close but not exact. Not helpful. 194 - (70 / (40 -23)) ? Let's see: 40-23=17. 70/17≈4.1176. Then 194 -4.1176≈189.88, which is not 187. Close, but not exact.\n\nAlternatively, 194 - (70 - (40 /23)). Let's compute: 40/23≈1.739. 70 -1.739≈68.26. Then 194 -68.26≈125.74, not 187. Not helpful.\n\nHmm. Let's see, what about multiplying and adding. For example: 70 *23=1610. That's way too big. 70*40=2800. Also way too big. 23*40=920. 194+920=1114. No. Not useful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (194 +23) - (70 -40). Wait, 194+23=217. 70-40=30. 217-30=187. That's the same as the previous equation. So same result. So that's another way to write it.\n\nAlternatively, 194 -70 +40 +23. Which is the same as the first equation. So that's 194-70=124. 124+40=164. 164+23=187. So yes. So both approaches work.\n\nBut since the problem requires using all numbers once and all operations are allowed, both equations are correct. The user might prefer one over the other. However, since the problem asks to return the equation in the answer tags, either should be acceptable. Let me check if there's any other possibility.\n\nWait, maybe division. Let's see: 70 divided by something. 70 / (40 -23) =70/17≈4.117. If we subtract that from 194, 194-4.117≈189.88, which is not 187. Not helpful. Alternatively, 194 - (40 /23) *70. Let's compute: 40/23≈1.739. 1.739*70≈121.73. 194 -121.73≈72.27. Not close.\n\nAlternatively, 23 * (70 - (194 /40)). Let's compute 194/40=4.85. 70-4.85=65.15. 23*65.15≈1498.45. Way too big. Nope.\n\nAlternatively, (70 +40) * (194 /23). Let's compute 194/23≈8.4348. 70+40=110. 110*8.4348≈927.828. No, way off.\n\nHmm. So division doesn't seem to help here. So the two possible equations are the ones using addition and subtraction. The one that groups the subtraction first, like (23 +194) - (70 -40). Let me make sure that in that equation, all numbers are used once. Yes, 23,194,70,40. All used once. So that's valid.\n\nAlternatively, if I write 23 +194 -70 +40. Let's compute: 23+194=217. 217-70=147. 147+40=187. That also works. So the equation 23 +194 -70 +40=187. But does that use all numbers and each once? Yes. Because you're adding and subtracting them. So that's another way to write it without parentheses. But maybe the problem expects parentheses for clarity. The example given was (1+2)/3. So maybe they want it grouped. But the problem doesn't specify that parentheses are required. However, in the example, they used parentheses. So perhaps the user expects parentheses.\n\nSo perhaps the best way is to write it as (23 + 194) - (70 - 40) = 187. Because this groups the operations and uses all numbers. Alternatively, (194 -70) + (40 +23) =187. Both are correct.\n\nBut the problem says \"create an equation that equals 187\". Either way is fine. Let me confirm the arithmetic again for the first option: 23 +194=217. Then 70-40=30. 217-30=187. Correct. For the second option: 194-70=124. 40+23=63. 124+63=187. Correct. Both equations work and use all numbers once.\n\nSo I can choose either. Maybe the first one uses a combination of addition and subtraction with grouping. Let me check if there's any other way. Hmm. Let's think differently. Suppose we have 70*(23 - (194/40)). Let's compute 194/40=4.85. 23-4.85=18.15. 70*18.15≈1270.5. No, way too big. Not helpful.\n\nAnother angle: 194 - (70 +23) =194-93=101. Then add 40, 101+40=141. Not 187. No.\n\nAlternatively, 194 -40=154. Then 154 +23=177. 177+70=247. Nope. Not helpful.\n\nHmm. So I think the two possible equations are the ones I mentioned. So I'll pick one of them. Let's go with the first one I found: (194 -70) + (40 +23) =187. Or maybe the other one which groups the numbers differently. Let me check if there's a standard way. The example given was (1+2)/3, so parentheses. So perhaps using parentheses is better. The equation (23 +194) - (70 -40)=187 is probably more efficient in terms of operations. So I'll present that as the answer.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(23 + 194) - (70 - 40) = 187</answer>"}]}

Let me think how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should consider the target number, 384. Let's see if I can break this down into factors or see what operations might get me close. 384 divided by 10 is 38.4, which isn't helpful. Let's think about multiplication because that can get large numbers quickly.\n\nLooking at the numbers given: 70 is the largest, followed by 47, 41, 36. Maybe multiplying some of these together. Let me try combinations:\n\n70 multiplied by 47 is 3290, which is way too big. 70 times 41 is 2870, still too big. 70 times 36 is 2520. Hmm, maybe combining two smaller numbers first?\n\nWait, 47 and 41 are both in the 40s. If I subtract them, 47 - 41 = 6. Then maybe 70 times 6 is 420. Then subtract 36? 420 - 36 = 384. Wait, that would be 70*(47-41) -36. Let's check: 47-41=6, 70*6=420, 420-36=384. Yes! But wait, does that use all numbers? Let's see: 47,41,70,36. Yes, all four. So the equation would be 70*(47-41) -36 = 384. Let me verify the calculation again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 47-41 is 6, 70*6 is 420, 420-36 is indeed 384. That works! So the equation is correct. But wait, I need to check if the order of operations is followed correctly. The parentheses around 47-41 ensure that the subtraction happens first, then multiplication by 70, then subtraction of 36. Yes, that's correct.\n</think>\n\n<answer>70 * (47 - 41) - 36 = 384</answer>"}]}

Maybe I can break it down into parts that these numbers can reach.\n\nFirst, I notice that 95 is a large number. If I can multiply it by something, maybe that gets close. Let's try 95 * 4 = 380, which is 14 less than 394. But I don't have a 4. Wait, maybe 95 * 8? That's 760, which is way too big. Hmm, so maybe multiplication isn't the way to go here. Alternatively, 95 plus something. Let's see: 95 + 59 = 154. Then 154 + 30 = 184, which is still way below 394. So that's not helpful.\n\nWhat if I subtract instead? 95 - 59 = 36. Then 36 * 8 = 288. Adding 30 would give 318, which is still less. Maybe 95 - 30 = 65. Then 65 * 8 = 520, which is over. 520 - 59 = 461, still not 394. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe combining 95 and 59 in some operation. Let's try 95 + 59 = 154. Then 154 * something. If I multiply by 3, that's 462. But I don't have a 3. Wait, 30 divided by 8 is 3.75. Hmm, not sure. Let me try another approach.\n\nWhat if I use 30 and 8 first. 30 * 8 = 240. Then add 95: 240 + 95 = 335. Then add 59: 335 +59= 394. Oh wait, that's 30*8 +95 +59. Let's check: 30*8 is 240, plus 95 is 335, plus 59 is 394. But wait, that uses all numbers: 30,8,95,59. Each once. So that works. Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me verify again.\n\n30 multiplied by 8 is 240. Then adding 95 gives 335, and then adding 59 gives 394. Yes, that's correct. So the equation would be 30 * 8 + 95 + 59 = 394. Let me check if all numbers are used once: 30,8,95,59. Yes. All four numbers used, each once. So that works. But wait, the problem says \"create an equation that equals 394\". So the equation would be (30 * 8) + 95 + 59 = 394. But the parentheses aren't necessary for order of operations here because multiplication is done first anyway. So maybe just 30*8 +95 +59. That should be correct. Let me check the calculation again step by step to make sure.\n\n30 * 8 = 240. Then 240 +95 = 335. Then 335 +59 = 394. Yes. So that's correct. Hmm, I think that's the solution. Let me see if there's another way, but this seems straightforward. Maybe the problem was easier than I thought.

I need to create an equation using the numbers 3, 96, 57, and 232 exactly once each, combining them with basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) to get 347. Hmm. Let me start by thinking about the target number, 347. It's a bit over 300, so maybe I can get close by adding some of the larger numbers here. Let's check the numbers available: 232 is the biggest, then 96, 57, and 3. \n\nFirst idea: Maybe start with 232 and see how to reach closer to 347 by adding or subtracting the other numbers. 347 - 232 = 115. So, I need to make 115 using 96, 57, and 3. Wait, can I combine 96 and 57? 96 + 57 = 153, which is way over. 96 - 57 = 39. Then 39 + 3 = 42, still not 115. Alternatively, 57 - 3 = 54, then 96 +54=150. Still not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, maybe 96 multiplied by something. Let's see. 96 * 1.2 = around 115.2. But how to get 1.2 with 57 and 3? That might not be straightforward. Let me think differently. What if I subtract 232 from something else? But 232 is the largest number, so subtracting it might lead to negatives, which would complicate things. Let's see: 96 + 57 + 3 = 156. 156 - 232 = -76. Not helpful. \n\nAnother approach: Maybe use division or multiplication to create larger numbers. For example, 232 is a big number. If I divide it by 3, that's about 77.333. Then maybe 77.333 + 96 = 173.333. Still not enough. Hmm. Wait, 232 - 57 = 175. Then 175 + 96 = 271. Still not 347. What if I multiply 96 by 3? 96*3=288. Then 288 +57=345. Close to 347, but 2 short. Then maybe 232 + (96*3) +57? But that uses 232 and the others, but then we have all numbers except 3 is already used in 96*3. Wait, but each number must be used once. So if I use 3 in 96*3, then 3 is used. Then 232, 96, 57, and 3 are all used. Wait, but 232 + (96*3) +57 is 232 + 288 +57= 577. That's way over. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe combining 232 and 57 first. 232 +57=289. Then 347-289=58. Need to make 58 with 96 and 3. 96/3=32. 32 is 32, which doesn't get to 58. Alternatively, 96 -3=93. 93 is too big. Maybe subtract: 289 + (96 -3) = 289 +93=382, which is over. Hmm.\n\nLet me try another angle. Let's list all possible operations between pairs and see. Maybe 232 plus 96 is 328. Then 347 -328=19. So need 19 from 57 and 3. 57 divided by 3 is 19. So 232 +96 + (57/3) = 232 +96 +19= 347. Wait, that works! Let me check: 232 +96 is 328. Then 57 divided by 3 is 19. 328 +19=347. Yes! And all numbers are used once: 232, 96, 57, 3. Perfect. So the equation is 232 + 96 + (57 / 3) = 347. Let me verify each number is used once: 232, 96, 57, 3—yes. All operations are basic arithmetic. So that's the solution.\n</think>\n\n<answer>232 + 96 + (57 / 3) = 347</answer>"}]}

Each number has to be used exactly once, and I can use basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Let me start by thinking about how these numbers can combine to reach 24.\n\nFirst, 24 is a relatively small number compared to some of these, especially 92 and 46. So maybe I need to use division or subtraction to bring those larger numbers down. Let's see.\n\nLooking at 92 and 46, I notice that 92 divided by something might get me closer. 92 divided by 4 is 23, which is close to 24. Hmm, that's interesting. Then if I can adjust that by 3, maybe. Wait, 92 divided by 4 is 23, so 23 plus 3 would be 26, which is too much. Or 23 minus 3 is 20. Not quite. Alternatively, maybe 92 divided by something else. Wait, 46 is half of 92, so 92 divided by 46 is 2. Then 2 multiplied by 3 and then by 4? Let's see: 2 * 3 = 6, 6 * 4 = 24. That works, but wait, I used 92 divided by 46, which uses 92 and 46. Then multiplying by 3 and 4 uses those. But that would be (92 / 46) * 3 * 4. Let's check that: 92 divided by 46 is 2, times 3 is 6, times 4 is 24. Yes! But wait, does that use all the numbers? Let's see: 92, 46, 3, and 4. Yep, all four numbers used once. So that equation would be ((92 / 46) * 3 * 4) = 24. But can I write that in a different way with parentheses? Let me see. Alternatively, maybe (92 / 46) * (3 * 4) = 2 * 12 = 24. So that's another way. Either way, the key is 92 divided by 46 equals 2, then multiplied by the product of 3 and 4 (12) gives 24.\n\nWait, but does the problem allow using multiple operations like that? The user said basic arithmetic operations can be used multiple times. So yes, as long as each number is used once. Let me double-check. The numbers used are 92, 46, 3, and 4. Each is used once. The operations are division and two multiplications. So that's allowed. Therefore, the equation would be (92 / 46) * 3 * 4 = 24. But maybe to format it with parentheses properly, perhaps ((92 / 46) * 3) * 4, but that's redundant. Alternatively, (92 / 46) * (3 * 4). That's more concise. Let me compute that: 92 divided by 46 is 2, and 3 times 4 is 12. 2 times 12 is indeed 24. So that works. Therefore, the equation is (92 / 46) * (3 * 4) = 24.\n\nAlternatively, maybe another combination. Let's see if there's another way. For example, using subtraction. Suppose I take 92 minus 46, that's 46. Then 46 minus 4 is 42, then 42 divided by 3 is 14. Not helpful. What about 46 minus 92? That's negative, which complicates things. Maybe 3 times 4 is 12, then 92 divided by something. Wait, 92 divided by (3 + 4) is 92/7, which is around 13.14, not helpful. Hmm. Or 3 * 4 = 12, then 46 - 12 = 34. 92 - 34 = 58. Not helpful. Let me think again.\n\nAnother angle: 24 can be made from 3 * 8, or 4 * 6, or 12 * 2, etc. Since we have a 3 and a 4, maybe that can be part of it. For example, if I can get 6 from 92 and 46, then 6 * 4 would be 24. Wait, 46 divided by something? 46 divided by (92/3) is not helpful. Alternatively, 92 minus 46 is 46. 46 divided by something. 46 divided by (something) equals 6? 46/6 is about 7.666, not an integer. Hmm. Maybe 92 minus (3*4) = 92 -12 = 80. Then 80 minus 46 = 34. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe use 46 divided by something. 46 divided by (92 - something). Let's see, 92 minus what? If I take 92 - (3*4) = 92-12=80. Then 46 / 80 is 0.575. Not helpful. Alternatively, 92 - 46 = 46. Then 46 / (4 -3) = 46/1=46. 46 * 3 would be 138, but that's too much. Maybe 46 + (3*4) =46+12=58. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, think about 3 and 4 making 12, and then how to get another 12 from 92 and 46. 92 - 46 = 46. 46 - 12=34. Not helpful. Maybe 92 divided by 46 is 2, then 2 * 3 *4=24. Oh, that's the same as before. So that seems to be the solution. Let me confirm again: 92 divided by 46 is 2. Then multiply by 3 (2*3=6) and then by 4 (6*4=24). So yes. So the equation is (92 / 46) * 3 * 4. Alternatively, grouping them as (92 /46) * (3*4) which is 2*12=24. Both ways work. So the answer could be written either way, but probably with parentheses to make the order clear. The problem allows using the operations multiple times, so multiplication twice is okay. Each number is used once. So I think that's the correct equation. Let me check once more for other possibilities, but I don't see another combination. For example, 46 - (92 / (4 +3)). Let's see: 4+3=7, 92/7≈13.14, then 46 -13.14≈32.86. Not 24. Or (46 - 92)/ (4 -3) = (-46)/1 = -46. Not helpful. How about 46 * 3 =138, then 138 -92=46, then 46 -4=42. No. Alternatively, 3*4=12, 92-12=80, 80-46=34. Nope. Another way: 46 - (3*4) =46-12=34, 92-34=58. Not helpful. So yeah, the only way seems to be (92/46)*(3*4)=24.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(92 / 46) * (3 * 4) = 24</answer>"}]}

Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should note that I have two 74s. Maybe I can use them in a way that their combination helps reach 37. Since 37 is half of 74, perhaps subtracting them could lead to zero, but that's not helpful here. Alternatively, maybe dividing one 74 by something to get 37. Let me explore that.\n\nIf I can get 74 divided by 2, that gives 37. But I don't have a 2. Maybe I can create a 2 using the other numbers. The other numbers are 60 and 104. Let's see. 104 minus 60 is 44, which isn't 2. 60 divided by something? 60 divided by 30 is 2, but how to get 30? Hmm. Alternatively, maybe 104 divided by something. 104 divided by 52 is 2, but again, need a 52. Not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps combining 60 and 104 with subtraction or addition. 104 - 60 = 44. Then maybe 44 can be used with the two 74s. Let me see. If I take one 74 and subtract 44 (from 104-60), that gives 30. Then the other 74 divided by 30? That would be 74/30 ≈ 2.466, not helpful. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, what if I take 74 plus 74? That's 148. Then 148 minus 104 is 44. Then 44 minus 60 would be -16. No, that's not useful. Maybe 148 divided by something. 148 divided by 4 is 37. Wait, how to get 4? The remaining numbers would be 60 and 104. Let's see. 104 minus 60 is 44. 44 divided by something? If I can get 44 divided by 11, which is 4. But where would 11 come from? Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe 60 divided by (104 divided by something). Let's try. If I take 104 divided by 60, that's about 1.733. If I then divide 60 by that, it's 34.615. Not helpful.\n\nAnother angle: 37 is a prime number, so maybe it's a result of subtraction or addition. For example, maybe (something) minus (something else) equals 37. Let's see. Let's think of possible combinations:\n\nIf I use the two 74s: 74 + 74 = 148. Then subtract 104 and 60. 148 - 104 = 44; 44 - 60 = -16. Not good. Alternatively, 148 - (104 + 60) = 148 - 164 = -16. Still no.\n\nWhat if I do 104 - 60 = 44. Then 44 + 74 = 118. Then 118 - 74 = 44 again. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe using division. Let's try combining the numbers with division. For example, 104 divided by something. If I can get 104 divided by (something) = 37, but 104 divided by 37 is approximately 2.81. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (74 - (104 / 60)) * something. Let's compute 104 divided by 60 first: approx 1.733. Then 74 minus that is about 72.267. Multiply by what's left, which is the other 74. That's way too big. Not helpful.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe factor 37 into the equation. Since 74 is 2*37, maybe using one 74 divided by 2. But how to get 2 from the remaining numbers. The remaining numbers are 60, 104, and the other 74. Wait, perhaps 60 + 44 is 104. So 104 - 60 =44. Then 44 divided by something. 44 divided by 22 is 2. But how to get 22. Let me see. The other 74. 74 divided by 22 is 3.363. Hmm, not helpful. Alternatively, if I take 74 and subtract 60, that gives 14. Then 104 divided by 14 is approximately 7.428. Not useful.\n\nWait, maybe (74 + 74) divided by something. 148 divided by (104 - 60) = 148 /44 ≈3.363. Not 37.\n\nHmm. Let me try to use multiplication and division. Since 74 is twice 37, maybe one of the 74s can be divided by 2, but I need to create a 2 from the other numbers. The other numbers are 60 and 104. Let's see. 104 minus 60 is 44. 44 divided by 22 is 2. How to get 22? 74 minus 52 is 22. But I don't have a 52. Alternatively, 60 minus 38 is 22. Not helpful. Wait, maybe 60 divided by (something). 60 divided by 30 is 2. How to get 30? 104 minus 74 is 30. Oh! Wait, here's an idea:\n\nTake one 74 and divide it by (104 - 74). Then 104 -74 is 30. So 74 /30 is about 2.466. But if I can then multiply that by something else to get 37? Not sure. The remaining numbers are 60 and the other 74. Wait, 60 divided by 30 is 2. Maybe 74 divided by (104 -74) * (something). Let me write this down.\n\nMaybe (74 / (104 -74)) * (something). 104-74=30. 74/30=2.466... Then multiply by 60? 2.466 *60=148. Then subtract the other 74? 148-74=74. Not 37.\n\nAlternatively, 74 divided by (something) to get 37. So 74 divided by 2. So I need to create 2 using 60, 104, and the other 74. Let's see. How to get 2 from those three numbers. Let's try (104 - 60) =44. Then 44 divided by 22=2. How to get 22? The other 74 minus 52=22. Wait, 52 is half of 104. Hmm. But I don't have a 52. Alternatively, 60 divided by 30=2. How to get 30? 104 -74=30. So 60/(104-74)=60/30=2. Then 74 divided by that 2 would be 37. That uses 74, 104, 74, and 60. Wait, let me check:\n\nEquation would be 74 / ( (104 -74) ) * (60 / (104-74)) ? Wait, maybe not. Let's see:\n\nIf I do 104 -74 =30. Then 60 /30=2. Then 74 /2=37. That uses 104,74,60, and the other 74. Wait, but each number can only be used once. Wait, 104 is used once, the first 74 is used in (104-74), then 60 is used in 60/30, and then the second 74 is used in 74/2. Wait, but the two 74s are separate. The problem states \"each number can only be used once\", but since there are two 74s, each can be used once. So maybe that's allowed. Let me check:\n\nThe numbers given are 74,60,104,74. So each instance is considered a separate number. So we can use each 74 once. So the equation would be 74 / ( (104 - 74) / 60 ). Wait, let me parse that. Wait, 104-74=30. Then 60 divided by 30=2. Then 74 divided by 2=37. So the equation would be 74 / ( (104 -74) / 60 ). Let's compute this step by step:\n\nFirst, compute (104 -74) which is 30. Then divide that by 60: 30/60=0.5. Then divide 74 by 0.5: 74/0.5=148. That's not right. So that gives 148. Hmm, that's not correct. Wait, perhaps the parentheses are misplaced.\n\nWait, if I want 74 divided by (60 divided by (104-74)), let me check. (104-74)=30. Then 60 divided by 30=2. Then 74 divided by 2=37. So the equation is 74 / (60 / (104 -74)). Let me compute that:\n\n104-74=30.\n\n60 divided by 30=2.\n\n74 divided by 2=37.\n\nYes, that works. Now, check that all numbers are used exactly once: 74 (numerator), 60, 104, 74 (denominator in the inner division). Wait, wait. Let's see:\n\nThe equation is 74 / (60 / (104 -74)).\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- First 104 is used.\n\n- The first 74 is used in (104 -74).\n\nWait, no. Wait, the first 74 in the equation is the one being divided. Then in the denominator, we have 60 divided by (104 -74). So:\n\nThe numbers used are:\n\n- The first 74.\n\n- 60.\n\n- 104.\n\n- The second 74 (in 104 -74).\n\nYes, each of the original numbers (74, 60, 104, 74) is used once. So that's acceptable. Because even though there are two 74s, each is considered a separate number and each is used once.\n\nSo the equation is 74 / (60 / (104 -74)) = 37.\n\nLet me verify the calculation:\n\nFirst, compute 104 -74: that's 30.\n\nThen compute 60 divided by 30: 60/30=2.\n\nThen divide 74 by 2: 74/2=37.\n\nYes, that works. So the equation is 74/(60/(104-74))=37.\n\nSo in the required format, it would be (74) / (60 / (104 - 74)). To make sure the parentheses are correct: (74) / ((60) / (104 - 74)).\n\nBut maybe to make it clearer with parentheses: (74) / (60 / (104 - 74)).\n\nSo the answer is <answer>74 / (60 / (104 - 74))</answer>\n</think>\n\n<answer>74 / (60 / (104 - 74))</answer>"}]}

Each number has to be used exactly once, and I can only use basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the target number, 204. Let's see what combinations might get close. Since 24 is one of the numbers, maybe multiplying it by something. Let's check 24 * 8.5 is 204, but I don't have 8.5. Alternatively, 204 divided by 24 is 8.5. Hmm, not sure. Let's see the other numbers: 34 is a larger number, so maybe combining that with others. 34 * 6 is 204, but how to get 6 from 24, 4, and 1? Wait, 24 divided by 4 is 6. Then 34 multiplied by (24/4) would be 34*6=204. But then we have 1 left over. Oh, right, because we have to use all numbers. So that's a problem. So that approach uses 34, 24, and 4, but leaves out 1. So maybe need to incorporate 1 somehow.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using addition or subtraction. Let's see. If I take 34 and multiply by something. Let's see 34*5=170. Then 170 + 34 = 204, but that's using 34 twice. Not allowed. Hmm. What if we use 24 * (something). 24*8=192. Then 192 +12=204. But where to get 12 from 34,4,1? Maybe 34 - (4* something). Wait, 34 - (4* (something)) to get 12. Let's see, 34 - (4*5.5)=12, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, 4*3=12. But where to get 3 from? 34 - 1=33. 33 divided by 11=3. But that's using more numbers. Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe 24*(34 - 1) divided by 4? Let's calculate that: 34 -1=33. 24*33=792. 792 divided by 4 is 198. Not 204. Close but not there. Alternatively, 24*(34 - (1/4)). Let's see, 1/4=0.25. 34 -0.25=33.75. 24*33.75=810. No, that's way too high.\n\nWhat if we do 34*4=136. Then 136 + 24=160. Then 160 +1=161. Not enough. Or 34*4=136, then 136*1=136. Then 136 +24=160. Still not.\n\nAlternatively, 24* (4 +1) =24*5=120. Then 120 +34=154. No. Not enough.\n\nWait, 34 +24=58. 58 *4=232. Then 232 -1=231. Not helpful.\n\nHow about 34*6=204. As before, but how to get 6 from 24,4,1. 24 divided by 4 is 6. Then 34*(24/4) +1? That would be 204 +1=205. Oh, but that's over. Or maybe subtract 1. 34*(24/4) -1=204-1=203. Not 204. Hmm. So close.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 34*(24/(4-1)). Let's compute denominator:4-1=3. 24/3=8. 34*8=272. That's over.\n\nWait, maybe (34 + 1) * (24 /4). Let's see: 34+1=35. 24/4=6. 35*6=210. Still over.\n\nHmm. Let's think of other combinations. Maybe subtraction. 240 - 36=204. How to get 240 and 36? 240 could be 24*10, but 10 from where? 34 - (4*1)=30. 24*10 would be 24*(34 - (4+1))=24*29=696. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 34 * (4 + 1) =34*5=170. 170 +24=194. Not enough. 194 +10=204, but where's the 10? No.\n\nWait, 204 divided by 4 is 51. So 51*4=204. How to get 51 using 34,24,1.

No.\n\nOr 34 * (24 - 4) +1. 24-4=20. 34*20=680 +1=681. Nope.\n\nAlternatively, (34 -4) * (24 +1). 30*25=750. Not.\n\nHow about combining numbers in another way. Let's think of 204 as 200 +4.

So 24/(4-1)=8, then 34*8=272. No. But maybe 24/(4/1 - something). Wait, 4 divided by 1 is 4. 24/(4 - something). Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, (24 + 34) * (4 -1). That's 58*3=174.

Maybe using division in a way that combines numbers. For example, 34 * (24 / (4/1)). Let's see: 4/1=4. 24/4=6. 34*6=204. Oh! Wait, that's 34*(24/(4/1)) which is 34*(24/4) since 4 divided by 1 is 4. So that's 34*6=204. But does this use all numbers? Let's check:\n\n34 is used, 24 is used, 4 is used, and 1 is used in 4/1. So yes. So the equation would be 34 * (24 / (4 / 1)) = 204. Let me verify:\n\nCalculate the denominator first: 4 divided by 1 is 4. Then 24 divided by 4 is 6. Then 34 multiplied by 6 is indeed 204. And all numbers are used once.

Let's start by thinking about possible combinations.\n\nFirst, maybe add some numbers and subtract others. For example, 77 is a big number. If I add 77 and 56, that's 133. Then I have 61 and 59 left. 61 minus 59 is 2. So 133 plus 2 is 135. Not enough. Or 133 plus 8 would be 141, but how to get 8 from 61 and 59? 61 - (59 / something?), but division might complicate. 59 divided by something... Maybe not.\n\nWait, if I subtract instead. Let's try 77 + 56 + 61 +59. That's way over. 77+56 is 133, plus 61 is 194, plus 59 is 253. Way too high. So adding all is too much. So maybe combine multiplication and division.\n\nWhat if I multiply two numbers and then add or subtract others. Let's see. For example, 56 * 2 is 112, but how to get 2 from others. Maybe 61 -59 = 2. Then 56*(61-59) = 56*2=112. Then 112 +77= 189, which is over. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 77 * something. 77*2=154. 154 -13=141. How to get 13 from 56,61,59. Hmm. 56 - (61-59) =56-2=54. Not helpful. Or 61 - (56/ something). 56 divided by 4 is 14, but 61-14=47. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe 77 + (56 * something). Let's see. 56*1=56. 77+56=133. Then need 8 more. 61-59=2. So 133+2=135. Still not 141. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe 56 divided by something. If 56/(61-59)=56/2=28. Then 77 +28=105. Then 105 + 61 -59=105+2=107. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe 61 * 2 =122. Then 122 + 19=141. How to get 19 from 77,56,59. 77 -56=21. 21 - (59/ something). 59 divided by something... Maybe not. Or 56 - (77 -59)=56-18=38. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 77 + 61=138. Then need 3 more. 59-56=3. So 138 +3=141. Oh! Wait, that works. Let me check: 77 +61=138, then 59-56=3. Adding those gives 138+3=141. So the equation would be 77 + 61 + (59 -56) =141. But need to use all numbers once and correct operations. Yes, 77,61,59,56 all used once. Operations are + and + and -. So the equation is (77 + 61) + (59 -56) =141. Let's compute: 77+61=138. 59-56=3. 138+3=141. Perfect. So that's the answer.\n</think>\n\n<answer>77 + 61 + (59 - 56) = 141</answer>"}]}

Let me start by thinking about how these numbers can combine.\n\nFirst, 742 is a pretty big number. The largest number I have is 89. Maybe I can multiply 89 by something to get close. Let's see: 89 * 8 = 712, which is under 742. 89*9=801, which is over. Hmm, so maybe 89 multiplied by a combination of the other numbers. Let's see what numbers are left: 5, 45, 59. \n\nWait, if I use 89 multiplied by 5, that's 445. Still not enough. Alternatively, 45 * 59 is a big number. Let me check that: 45*59 = 2655. That's way too big. Maybe subtract something from that? But then I have to use all numbers. Maybe 45*59 - 89 -5. Let's calculate that: 2655 -89=2566, 2566-5=2561. Nope, way over.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 59 multiplied by something. 59*12=708, which is close to 742. 708 + 34 would get there. But where would I get 34 from? The remaining numbers would be 89,5,45. Hmm. Let's see. 45 - (89/5). 89 divided by 5 is 17.8, so 45-17.8 is 27.2. Adding that to 708 would be 735.2, not quite 742. Not helpful.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe 89 * (something) plus or minus another number. Let's think. Suppose I do 89 * 8 = 712. Then 742-712=30. So I need to make 30 from the remaining numbers: 5,45,59. Wait, but I have to use all numbers. So 5,45,59 must be used to make 30. Let's see. 45 - (59-5) = 45 -54 = -9. Not helpful. Alternatively, (59 - 45) *5 = 14*5=70. But 712+70=782, which is over. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe 89*(5 + something). Let's try 5 + 45 = 50. 89*50=4450. That's way too big. 89*(5+45) +59=4450+59=4509. Not helpful. Alternatively, 89*(59 -45). 59-45=14. 89*14=1246. Then subtract 5? 1246-5=1241. Not 742.\n\nWhat if I do (89 + 5) * something. 89+5=94. 94* something. 94*8=752. Close to 742. 94*7.8=733.2. Not helpful. The remaining numbers are 45 and 59. Maybe 94*(45 - something) using 59? Wait, but I need to use all numbers. Let me see. If I do (89 +5) * (59 -45) = 94*14=1316. Then subtract something? But already used all numbers. No.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe 59*5=295. 295* something. Let's see, 295*2.5=737.5. Close to 742. But how to get 2.5 from the remaining numbers? 89/45=1.977... Not exact. Maybe 45 - (89/5)=45 -17.8=27.2. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 59*(45 -5)=59*40=2360. Then subtract 89? 2360-89=2271. No. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe division could help. Let's think. If I do 89 * (59 - (45/5)). Let's compute that: 45/5=9. So 59-9=50. Then 89*50=4450. Still too big.\n\nHmm. Maybe (89 * 5) + (59 * 45). Let's compute that: 445 + 2655=3100. Way too big. No.\n\nAlternatively, (89 +59) * (45 -5). 148 *40=5920. No.\n\nWait, 742 is even. Let me check if it's divisible by any of the numbers. 742 divided by 89: 742 ÷89=8.337. Not a whole number. 742 ÷5=148.4. Hmm. 742 ÷45≈16.48. 742 ÷59≈12.576. So none of them divide evenly.\n\nWhat if I think of 742 as 800 -58. How can I get 800 and subtract 58? Let's see. 800 could be 5*160, but not sure. 89*9=801, which is close. 801 -59=742. Wait, that's 89*9 -59=742. But I need to use 5 and 45. So that's not possible because I can't use 9. Wait, but maybe 89*(something) using 5 and 45. For example, 89*(45/5) -59. Let's calculate: 45/5=9, 89*9=801, 801-59=742. Oh! Wait, that uses all numbers: 45,5 (as 45/5), 89, and 59. So 89*(45/5) -59=742. Let me check that again. 45 divided by 5 is 9. 89 multiplied by 9 is 801. 801 minus 59 equals 742. Yes! That works. All numbers used once. Operations are division, multiplication, and subtraction. Perfect.\n</think>\n\n<answer>89 * (45 / 5) - 59 = 742</answer>"}]}

Each number has to be used exactly once, and we can use basic operations. Hmm, okay. Let's start by thinking about the target number, 231. Breaking it down, 231 divided by 11 is 21. So maybe 11 times something equals 231. If I can get 21 by using the other numbers (4, 3, and the other 11), then multiplying by 11 would work. Wait, but I can only use each number once. So if I use 11 once for the multiplication, the other 11 would have to be part of the 21. Let me think: 21 can be 11 plus 10, but where does 10 come from? 4 and 3 can make 7 or 1 (4-3) or 12 (4*3). Not 10. Alternatively, 21 could be 24 minus 3. 24 is 4*6, but 6 isn't directly available. Wait, 4*3 is 12, then 12 plus something? 12 plus 9 is 21, but 9 isn't there either. Hmm.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe 231 is 3*77. How to get 77 from 11, 11, 4. Let's see. 11*7 is 77. How to make 7 using 11 and 4. Wait, 11 minus 4 is 7. So that would be 11*(11 - 4) = 77, then 77*3 = 231. But wait, that uses two 11s, 4, and 3. Yes! So that's 3 * 11 * (11 - 4). Let me check that: 11 -4 is 7, 7*11 is 77, 77*3 is 231. Perfect! But let me make sure I used each number once: 3, 11, 11, 4. Yes, each is used once. So the equation would be 3 * 11 * (11 - 4) = 231.

Let me start by thinking about the target number. 837 is a bit large, so maybe multiplication is involved here. Let's see.\n\nFirst, I should check the approximate sizes. Let me list the numbers: 86, 8, 63, 72. The largest numbers here are 86 and 72. If I multiply them, 86 * 72 = let's calculate that. 80*72=5760, 6*72=432, so total 6192. That's way too big. Hmm. Maybe that's not the way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe combining some of the other numbers. Let's see: 63 and 72. 63 * 72 = 4536. Still too big. Maybe subtracting? 86 - 8 =78. Then 78 * something.

No, too high.\n\nWait, maybe division could help. Let's see. If I can get a larger intermediate number and then divide to bring it down. For example, 63 *72=4536. Then divided by 8: 4536/8=567. Then add 86? 567+86=653. Not enough. Alternatively, 4536 divided by something else. Maybe 86? 4536/86 is around 52.7, which doesn't seem helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 86*63=5418.

Not allowed.\n\nAlternatively, (86 +72) * (63 -8). Let's calculate that. 86+72=158. 63-8=55. 158*55=8690. That's way over.\n\nWait, 63*8=504. Then 504 +86=590. Then 590 +72=662. Not enough.

Maybe I need a different approach. Let's think about factors of 837. Let's factor 837. Divided by 3: 837/3=279. 279/3=93. 93/3=31. So 837=3*3*3*31. Hmm. So 31 is a prime here. Maybe we can get 31 through the numbers. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, 837 divided by 8 is about 104.625. If I can make 104.625 by combining 86, 63,72, then multiply by 8. Wait, but numbers can be used once. So 8 is already used in division.\n\nAlternatively, 837 = (86 + 8) * (63 - 72). Wait, no. 63 -72 is negative, so that would be negative. 86+8=94. 94*(-9)= -846.

Maybe 86 + 8 =94. 94*9=846. 846 is close to 837. 846-9=837. But 9 from where? 63-72? No. Wait, 94*9.5=893, which is over. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, 86*9=774. Then 774 +63=837. But how to get 9? Using 72 and 8. 72 divided by 8 is 9. So that's 72/8=9. Then 86*9 +63. Let's check that. 72/8=9. 86*9=774. 774 +63=837. Yes! But wait, that uses 72, 8, 86, 63. All numbers once.

Let's start by thinking about what operations can lead to larger numbers. Multiplication is probably key here because 920 is a pretty big number. Let's check the numbers we have: 45, 69, 8, 75. \n\nFirst, maybe multiply two of the larger numbers and then see how the others can adjust it to reach 920. Let's try 75 and 45. 75 * 45 is 3375. That's way too big. If I subtract something from that, maybe? 3375 minus something. But then we have 69 and 8 left. 3375 - 69 -8 = 3375 -77=3298. Not close. So maybe that's not the right approach.\n\nWhat about 69 and 8? 69 *8=552. Then, adding 75 gives 627, then multiplying by 45? No, that would be way too big. Alternatively, maybe 552 +75=627, then 627 +45=672. Not enough. So that's not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe using division to reduce a large product? Let's see. Suppose I do 75 * 69. Let's calculate that: 75*69=5175. Then maybe divide by something. If I divide by 5, that would be 1035, but we don't have a 5. Wait, the numbers we have left are 45 and 8. Wait, maybe 5175 divided by 45? 5175 /45 = 115. Then 115 *8=920. Oh! That could work. Let's check:\n\n75 * 69 = 5175. Then 5175 /45 = 115. Then 115 *8 =920. So the equation would be (75 * 69 /45) *8 =920. But let's verify the order of operations here. Since multiplication and division are left to right. So (75*69)=5175, then divided by 45 is 115, then multiplied by 8 gives 920. Yes. So the equation is ((75 * 69) / 45) * 8 = 920. Let me check all numbers are used once: 75, 69, 45, 8. Yes. All used once. So that works. \n\nAlternatively, maybe another way, but this seems to fit. Let me double-check the calculations. 75*69: 70*69=4830, plus 5*69=345, so 4830+345=5175. Then 5175 divided by 45: 45*100=4500, so 5175-4500=675. 675/45=15. So 100+15=115. Then 115*8=920. Yep. Correct. So the equation is (75 × 69 ÷ 45) × 8 = 920. All numbers used once, operations are basic. So that should be the answer.\n</think>\n\n<answer>((75 * 69) / 45) * 8 = 920</answer>"}]}

Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let me recall that 528 is the target. Let's see what operations might get us there. Maybe multiplication could help since 528 is a relatively large number. Let's check if any combination of multiplying two of these numbers gets close. For example, 68 * 30 is 2040, which is way too big. 523 * 43 is way too big as well (like around 22,489). So maybe multiplication of two numbers isn't the way unless combined with other operations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps combining addition and multiplication. Let's think: 523 is a big number. If we subtract something from 523 to get close to 528. Wait, 523 is less than 528 by 5. Hmm, but how to get 5 from the remaining numbers: 68, 43, 30. Let's see. If I had 68 - 43 = 25, but that's not 5. Or 43 - 30 = 13. Not helpful. Maybe division? 30 / 6 = 5, but we don't have a 6 here. Wait, but maybe 30 divided by (68 - 43) which is 25, so 30/25 is 1.2. That's not helpful. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 523 plus something. 528 - 523 = 5. So if I can get 5 from 68, 43, 30. Let's see. 43 - 30 = 13, 68 - 43 = 25. 30/ (68 - 43) = 30/25 = 1.2. Not 5. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe if we do 68 - (43 - 30) = 68 -13 = 55. Then 523 +55 = 578, which is over. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 523 - (something) = 528. But 523 is less than 528, so subtracting would make it even smaller. So that's not possible. So maybe adding to 523.\n\nWait, but 523 + 5 = 528. So how to get 5 from 68, 43, 30. Let's see. Maybe 43 - (68 - 30). Let's compute 68 -30 =38, then 43 -38=5. So 43 - (68 -30) =5. Then 523 +5 =528. That works. Let's check:\n\nNumbers used: 523, 43, 68, 30. All used once. The equation would be 523 + (43 - (68 - 30)) = 528. Let me compute that step by step:\n\nFirst, 68 -30 =38. Then 43 -38=5. Then 523 +5=528. Perfect. That uses all numbers once with the operations -, -, +. Wait, but the problem allows using each arithmetic operation multiple times, but each number once. So that should work. Let me confirm the equation: 523 + (43 - (68 - 30)) = 528. Yes. That's (68 -30) is 38, then 43 -38 is 5, then 523 +5 is 528. All numbers used once.

Or maybe (43 - 28) = 15, then 15 +6=21. Wait, that's 15+6=21, but then how do the other numbers fit? Wait, if I have 59-53=6, and 43-28=15, then 15 +6=21. That uses all four numbers.

If I can get 1 from those, 7 + 1 = 8. But 67 minus 13 is 54, which is not 1. Alternatively, 67 divided by 13 is about 5.15, not helpful.

Maybe 9 - (13 / something). If I have 67 - 63 =4, then 9 - (13 /4) is 9 - 3.25 =5.75. Not 8. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe group differently.

Hmm, 873 is a pretty big number. Let me think about how to get there with these numbers.\n\nFirst, I should note that I have two 71s. Since 71 is a prime number, maybe multiplying them could help reach a larger number. Let's try multiplying 71 by 71. That would be 71*71. Let me calculate that: 70*70 is 4900, plus 70*1 + 1*70 is 140, plus 1*1=1, so total 4900+140+1=5041. Wait, that's way too big. 5041 is way over 873. So multiplying them might not be the way. Maybe adding them? 71 +71 is 142. That's still not close.\n\nWhat if I use subtraction? 71 -71 is zero, which probably isn't helpful. Division? 71/71 is 1. Hmm. So maybe the two 71s need to be combined in a different way with another number.\n\nLet me look at the other numbers: 14 and 50. 50 is a round number, which might be useful. Maybe multiplying 50 by something. If I take 50*14, that's 700. Then 700 plus 71? That would be 771, which is still 102 short. 700 + 71 + 71 = 842. Still not enough. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 50*17. Let's see, but how to get 17? 71 minus something. Wait, maybe 71 - (14) =57. Then 50*57=2850, which is way over. Not helpful.\n\nWait, 873 divided by 71 is approximately 12.29. So maybe 71 * 12.29 is 873. But how to get 12.29 from the other numbers. Let's see, 14 and 50. 50/14 is approximately 3.57. 50 -14=36. 50+14=64. Maybe 71 * (50 -14) =71*36=2556. That's too big. \n\nAlternatively, 71*(14 +50)=71*64=4544. Still way too big. Maybe division. 71*(50/14)=71*(25/7)≈71*3.57≈253.57. Not close.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use subtraction to reduce a larger number. For example, 71*14=994. Then subtract 50? 994-50=944. Then subtract the other 71? 944-71=873. Wait, let me check:\n\n71 *14 = 994.\n\n994 -50 = 944.\n\n944 -71 = 873.\n\nBut wait, I need to use all numbers exactly once. So in this case, I used 71,14,50,71. But the two 71s are both used here. Let's see: 71 (the first one) multiplied by 14 gives 994, then subtract 50 gives 944, then subtract the second 71 gives 873. So that uses all numbers: 71,14,50,71. Each once. So that's (71*14) -50 -71 =873.\n\nWait, let me compute that again step by step:\n\nFirst, 71 *14 = 994.\n\nThen 994 -50 =944.\n\nThen 944 -71 =873.\n\nYes, that works. All numbers used once. Let me check: 71, 14, 50, and the other 71. Yep. So the equation is (71 *14) -50 -71 =873.\n\nAlternatively, written as 71×14 -50 -71. But to make sure the order of operations is correct, maybe parentheses aren't needed because multiplication comes first, but perhaps adding parentheses for clarity. Like ((71 ×14) −50) −71. Either way, the result is correct. Let me verify:\n\n71 ×14: 70×14=980, plus 1×14=14, total 994. 994 -50 is 944. Then 944 -71 is 873. Correct. So the equation would be (71 * 14) - 50 - 71 =873. But since each number is used once, and the operations are multiplication, subtraction, subtraction. So all numbers are used once. That should be the answer.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(71 * 14) - 50 - 71 = 873</answer>"}]}

Maybe subtract some numbers to get that. For example, if I have a larger number minus another number, that could work. Let's see. 68 is the largest here. If I subtract something from 68 to get 28, that something would be 40. Do any of the other numbers combine to make 40? Let's check. 51 - 23 is 28, not 40. 22 + 23 is 45. 51 - 22 is 29. Hmm, not 40. Maybe 51 minus something else? Wait, 68 - 40 = 28, but how to get 40 from 22, 51, 23? Maybe 51 - (23 - 22) = 51 -1 =50. That's not helpful. Or maybe 22 + 23 =45, so 68 -45=23, which is not 28. \n\nAlternatively, maybe add two numbers and subtract another. Like 51 +23=74, then subtract 68 and 22. Wait, 74 -68=6, then 6-22= -16. No good. Or 68 -22=46, then 46 - (51-23). Let's see, 51-23=28, so 46 -28=18. Not 28. \n\nWhat if I multiply some numbers? 22 * 23 is 506. That's too big. 51/23 is about 2.217. Maybe not helpful. How about 68 divided by something? 68 divided by 22 is about 3.09. Hmm. \n\nWait, maybe combining operations. Let's try 68 - (51 - 22) = 68 -29=39. Then 39 -23=16. Not 28. \n\nAlternatively, (51 - 22) + (68 -23) =29 +45=74. No. \n\nWait, maybe using division. Let's see. 68 divided by something. If I can get 68 divided by (something) to be 28, but 68 divided by 28 is about 2.428, which isn't an integer. Maybe 68 divided by a combination. Like 68 divided by (23 - (51/22)). But that's getting complicated and fractions might not help. \n\nWhat about 51 - 23 =28. Then I need to use 22 and 68. Maybe 51 -23 =28, but then how to include 22 and 68. Since we have to use all numbers. So maybe (68 - (22 + something)) =28. Wait, 68 -22=46. 46 - (something) =28. Then something is 18. How to get 18 from 51 and 23? 51 -23=28 again. That's not 18. 23 - (51/ something). 51 divided by 23 is like 2.217. 23 -2.217≈20.78. Not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, 68 - (51 - (23 -22)). Let's break that down. 23-22=1. 51-1=50. 68-50=18. No. \n\nWait, maybe using multiplication and division. Let's see. If I can make 28 by multiplying or dividing. For example, (68 -51) =17. Then 22 +23=45. 17 and 45. Hmm, 45 -17=28. Wait, that's possible. Let's check: (68 -51) =17, and (23 +22)=45. Then 45 -17=28. So combining all of them: (23 +22) - (68 -51) =45 -17=28. Let's verify:\n\n23 +22 is 45, 68 -51 is 17. 45 -17=28.

But how can I incorporate the 8s into the equation so that they somehow cancel out or add up in a way that doesn't affect the 420 +3?\n\nWait, maybe subtract the product of the 8s divided by something? Let me think. Let's see, 8 times 8 is 64. If I do 420 + 3 + (8*8), that would be 420 +3 +64 = 487, which is way too high. But 423 is 3 more than 420, so maybe I need to use the 8s to make 3 somehow.

If I subtract 50 from 98, that gives me 48. Then I have 68 and 17 left. 68 minus 17 is 51. 48 plus 51 is 99. Not enough. Hmm. Or maybe 98 plus 50 is 148. Then I need 4 more. But I have 68 and 17 left. 68 divided by 17 is 4. So 148 + (68/17) = 148 +4 =152. Wait, that works! Let me check again. 98 +50 =148. Then 68 divided by 17 is 4. 148 +4=152. Yes! So the equation would be 98 +50 + (68 /17) =152. But wait, are all numbers used once? 98,50,68,17—yes. All are used. And the operations are +, +, and /. That's allowed. So that works. Let me see if there's another way, but this seems correct. Let me verify:\n\n68 divided by 17 is indeed 4. Then 98+50 is 148. Adding 4 gives 152. Perfect. So the equation is (98 + 50) + (68 /17) =152. Or maybe written as 98 + 50 +68 /17. Since order of operations would handle division first. But to be explicit, parentheses might be good.

If I multiply 62 by something, maybe that's a start. 62 times 2 is 124, which is close. But how do I get 2 from the remaining numbers 6, 34, 44?

Let me check: 62 + 44 = 106, then 106 + 34 = 140, then 140 - 6 = 134. But I have to use all numbers once and in the equation. So the equation would be 62 + 44 +34 -6.

I need to use the numbers 83, 42, 49, and 98 each exactly once, with basic arithmetic operations to make 272. Hmm. Let's start by thinking about possible combinations. \n\nFirst, 272 is a bit over 200, so maybe I need some multiplication to get there. Let me check what each number is close to. 83 is around 80, 42 is 40, 49 is almost 50, and 98 is almost 100. So maybe combining the larger numbers first.\n\nIf I multiply 98 by something, that could get a big number. Let's see: 98 * 2.7 is around 265, which is close to 272. But I don't have a 2.7. Alternatively, maybe subtracting or adding other numbers. Wait, maybe combine subtraction and addition. Let's see:\n\nWhat if I do 98 * 3? That's 294, which is higher than 272. Then subtract 22 to get 272. But how to get 22 from 83, 42, 49. Wait, the remaining numbers are 83, 42, 49. Let's see. 83 minus 42 is 41, then 41 minus 49 is negative 8. That's not helpful. Alternatively, 42 + 49 is 91. Then 83 - 91 is -8. Hmm, not useful. \n\nAlternatively, maybe 98 multiplied by something else. Let's see 98 * 2 is 196. Then we need 76 more to reach 272. But how to get 76 from 83, 42, 49. 83 - 42 + 49 = 83 -42 is 41, plus 49 is 90. 196 + 90 is 286, which is over. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe subtract instead. 98 * 3 is 294. Then 294 - 22 is 272. How to get 22 from the remaining numbers. 42 - (83 -49). Let's compute that: 83 -49 is 34. Then 42 -34 is 8. Not 22. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 49 - (83 -42). 83 -42 is 41, then 49 -41 is 8. Still not. Maybe 42 + (49 - something). Wait, maybe 83 - (42 +49) = 83 -91 = -8. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let's try another approach. Maybe 83 * something. 83*3 is 249. Then 272 -249 is 23. How to get 23 from 98, 42, 49. Not sure. 98 - (42 +49) = 98 -91 =7. 7 is not 23.\n\nWait, maybe use division. Let's see. 98 divided by something. 98 /49 is 2. Then 2 * 83 is 166. Then 166 + 42 = 208. Not enough. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, 83 + 42 = 125. Then 125 + 49 = 174. 174 +98=272. Wait, that works! Wait, 83 +42 is 125, 125 +49 is 174, 174 +98 is 272. Oh, but that uses all the numbers with just addition. But the problem says to use each number once and all operations are allowed. Wait, but addition is allowed. So the equation would be 83 +42 +49 +98 =272. Let me check that. 83 +42 is 125, 125+49 is 174, 174+98 is 272. Yes! That works. Wait, but did I miss any restrictions? The problem says \"using basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) one or multiple times\" but each number is used once, and all numbers must be used. So adding them all up is allowed. But let me verify the sum: 83 +42 is 125, 125+49=174, 174+98=272. Yes. So why didn't I think of that earlier? Maybe because I overcomplicated it with trying multiplications. So the answer is 83 +42 +49 +98 =272. So the equation is (83 + 42) + (49 +98) =272, but since addition is associative, maybe just 83 +42 +49 +98. But since the problem allows using operations multiple times, and each number once, this should be acceptable. Let me check the sum again. 83 +42 =125. 49+98=147. 125+147=272. Yes. So the equation is 83 +42 +49 +98 =272. But the example given in the problem uses parentheses, like (1+2)/3. So maybe I need to format it with parentheses even if they are not necessary. For example, (83 +42) + (49 +98). But the sum is the same. Alternatively, just adding all together without parentheses. But maybe the problem requires using at least one operation, but addition is an operation. So maybe that's acceptable. Let me check the problem statement again: \"You can use basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) one or multiple times but each number can only be used once, and you must use all the numbers.\" So adding all numbers together uses the + operation multiple times, which is allowed. So the equation is 83 + 42 +49 +98 =272. So the answer should be enclosed in <answer> tags. Therefore, the final answer is <answer>83 + 42 + 49 + 98</answer>.

I need to create an equation using the numbers 95, 59, 7, and 23, each exactly once, with basic arithmetic operations to get 989. Hmm, 989 is a pretty big number, so maybe multiplication is involved here. Let's start by looking at the largest numbers first.\n\nThe two biggest numbers are 95 and 59. If I multiply those, 95 * 59. Let me calculate that. 95 times 50 is 4750, and 95 times 9 is 855, so total would be 4750 + 855 = 5605. That's way bigger than 989. So maybe division? But 95 divided by 59 is less than 2, which isn't helpful. Maybe subtraction? 95 - 59 = 36. Still too small. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe combining 95 and 59 with another operation. Let's see. What if I do 95 multiplied by something else. Let's see, 95 * 23. Let me compute that: 95*20=1900, 95*3=285, so 1900+285=2185. Then subtract 59? 2185 -59=2126. Still too big. Not helpful. Or maybe 95* (23 - 7) which is 95*16=1520. Still not 989.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 59 multiplied by 23. 59*20=1180, 59*3=177, so total 1357. Subtract 95? 1357-95=1262. Still not. Or 59* (23 -7)=59*16=944. Closer. Then 944 + something. But I have 95 left. 944 +95 is 1039. Not 989. Hmm.\n\nWait, 7 and 23. 7*23=161. Then 95*59=5605. Maybe 5605 divided by (something with 7 and 23). Wait, but 5605 divided by 5.7 (if that were allowed) would be around 983, but I can't use decimals. Not sure. Alternatively, 95* (59 - (23+7)). Let's see: 23+7=30. 59-30=29. 95*29=2755. Still not 989.\n\nLet me try a different approach. 989 divided by 95 is approximately 10.41. So maybe 95 times (something around 10.41). But how to get that with the other numbers. 59, 7, 23. Let's see. 23 + 7 = 30. 59 - 30 = 29. Wait, 59 - (23 +7) = 29. So 95 *29=2755. Not helpful. Alternatively, 59 -23=36. 36 -7=29. Same as before.\n\nAlternatively, 23 * 7 = 161. Then 95 + 59 = 154. 161 + 154=315. Still too low. Maybe 95*7=665. Then 59*23=1357. 665 +1357=2022. No. Or 95*7=665, 59*23=1357. 1357 -665=692. Not 989.\n\nWait, 989. Let me see the factors of 989. Let's check if 23 is a factor. 23*43=989. Because 23*40=920, plus 23*3=69, so 920+69=989. Yes! So 23*43=989. But how can I get 43 from the remaining numbers? The remaining numbers are 95, 59, 7. Wait, 95, 59, and 7. Let's see. 59 - (95/ something). For example, 95 divided by 5 is 19, but I don't have a 5. Wait, 95 divided by 7 is about 13.57. 59 - 13.57 is 45.43, which is close to 43 but not exact. Alternatively, maybe 59 - (95 - something). Hmm. Or 95 - 59 =36. Then 36 +7=43. Wait, that's 36+7=43. So 43= (95 -59) +7. Then multiply that by 23. So ( (95 -59) +7 ) *23 = (36 +7)*23 =43*23=989. Oh! That works. Let me check the numbers: 95,59,7,23. All used once. Operations: subtraction, addition, multiplication. Yes! So the equation is ((95 - 59) + 7) *23 =989. Let me verify:\n\n95-59=36\n\n36+7=43\n\n43*23=989. Perfect!\n</think>\n\n<answer>((95 - 59) + 7) * 23 = 989</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using the numbers 53, 4, 75, and 38 each exactly once, and combine them with basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) to get 280. Hmm. Let's start by thinking about how these numbers can interact. \n\nFirst, 280 is a multiple of 40 and 70, so maybe I can get close to that. Let me look at the numbers given. 75 is a large number, so maybe multiplying it by something. If I multiply 75 by 4, that's 300. Then 300 minus something. Let's see. 300 minus 20 would be 280. Do I have the numbers to make 20? Well, there's 53 and 38 left. 53 minus 38 is 15. Hmm, not 20. Alternatively, 53 minus 38 is 15, but 15 isn't helpful here. Wait, maybe if I subtract 53 and 38 from 300 in some way. Let me try: 75 * 4 = 300. Then subtract 53 and 38? But that would be 300 - 53 -38 = 300 -91=209. Not 280. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe adding 75 and 38 first. 75 +38=113. Then multiply by something. 113*4=452. Then subtract 53? 452-53=399. No, that's too high. Or maybe 113*2.5 would be 280, but I don't have 2.5 here. \n\nWhat if I use division? Let's see. 53 is a prime number, so maybe dividing it by 4? 53/4 is 13.25. Then 75 - 38 =37. 13.25 *37 would be... 13*37=481, plus 0.25*37=9.25, so total 490.25. Not helpful. \n\nAnother approach: 280 divided by 4 is 70. So if I can get 70 from the other numbers. 75 - (something) =70. So 75 -5=70. How to get 5? 53 and 38. 53 -38=15. That's 15. Hmm, 15 divided by 3 is 5, but I don't have a 3. Alternatively, maybe 38 - (53 / something). Wait, 53 divided by 4 is 13.25. Then 38 -13.25=24.75. 75 -24.75=50.25. 50.25*4=201. Not helpful. \n\nWait, maybe I can use subtraction and multiplication. Let's think: 75*4=300. Then 300 - (53 -38)=300 -15=285. Close to 280, but still 5 off. How to get rid of 5? Maybe subtract 5 more. But I don't have any numbers left. All numbers are used once. So that approach might not work. \n\nHow about combining 38 and 4 first? 38*4=152. Then 152 +75=227. 227 +53=280. Wait, that's 38*4=152. 152 +75=227. Then 227 +53=280. Oh! That works! Let me check: 38 multiplied by 4 is 152, then add 75 (152+75=227), then add 53 (227+53=280). Wait, but are we allowed to use the numbers once? Let me see: 38,4,75,53—each used exactly once. Yes. So the equation would be (38 *4) +75 +53= 280. Wait, but the way to write it is with all numbers used once and operations. Let me verify the calculation: 38*4 is 152. 152+75 is 227. 227+53 is 280. Yes! So that's the equation. So the equation is 38*4 +75 +53 =280. But since the problem requires using all four numbers and each operation is allowed, maybe parentheses aren't necessary here. Alternatively, could write (38 *4) +75 +53. But since multiplication has higher precedence, it's already calculated first. So the equation is 38*4 +75 +53 =280. Let me check again: 38*4=152. 152+75=227. 227+53=280. Yep, that's correct. And all numbers are used once. So this should work.\n</think>\n\n<answer>38 * 4 + 75 + 53 = 280</answer>"}]}

I need to use all the numbers 36, 97, 44, and 12 exactly once each with basic operations to get 165. Hmm. Let me start by thinking about how these numbers can combine. \n\nFirst, 97 is the largest number here. Maybe if I subtract something from 97 to get close to 165. Wait, 97 is less than 165, so that might not work. Alternatively, maybe adding 97 and another number. Let's see: 97 + 36 = 133. Then 133 + 44 = 177, which is over. Hmm. 177 -12 = 165. Wait, that's interesting. So 97 +36 +44 -12. Let's check: 97+36 is 133, plus 44 is 177, minus 12 is 165. Oh, that works! Wait, but does that use all numbers once? Let me check: 97,36,44,12. Yes, all four. So that would be 97 + 36 + 44 - 12 = 165. But let me make sure that's correct.\n\nWait, 97 plus 36 is 133. 133 plus 44 is 177. 177 minus 12 is indeed 165. So that's the equation. But maybe the problem requires some multiplication or division? Because adding three numbers and subtracting one might be too straightforward. Let me see if the problem allows that. The user said basic operations can be used one or multiple times. So addition and subtraction are allowed. So maybe that's the solution. But let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, could there be another way? Let's see. Maybe multiply some numbers. For example, 44 and 12. 44*12 is 528, which is way too big. 97 -36 =61. 61 * something. 61*2.7 would be around 165, but we don't have fractions. Maybe 44 divided by 12 is about 3.666. Then 97 +44/12 +36. Wait, but that's using division but not sure. Let's calculate: 97 + (44/12) is 97 + 3.666... which is 100.666..., plus 36 is 136.666... which is not 165. Hmm.\n\nWhat about 97 multiplied by something. 97*1.7 is around 165, but how to get 1.7 with the remaining numbers 36,44,12. Not sure. Alternatively, 97 + (something). Maybe 36*44=1584. 1584 divided by 12 is 132. Then 97 +132 =229. No. Or 36*44=1584, 1584 -97=1487, which is way off. \n\nAnother idea: 97 - (44 -36) *12. Let's compute that: 44-36=8. 8*12=96. 97-96=1. Not helpful. \n\nOr 97 + (44 - (36/12)). 36/12=3. 44-3=41. 97+41=138. No. \n\nWait, maybe (97 - 12) * something. 97-12=85. 85*2=170, which is close to 165. 85*1.94... Hmm, but how to get 1.94 with 36 and 44. 44/36 is about 1.222. 85*(1.222) is about 103. Not close. \n\nAlternatively, 36 + 97 =133. 133 +44=177. 177 -12=165. Wait, that's the same as the first idea. So that uses all numbers once. That seems correct. Let me check if the operations are allowed. Yes, addition and subtraction. Each number used once. So the equation is 97 + 36 + 44 -12 =165. So that would be written as (97 + 36) + (44 -12) or without parentheses since order doesn't matter here. But the problem says to return the equation. So maybe 97 +36 +44 -12 =165.

Each number can only be used once, and I can use +, -, *, / as needed. Let me start by thinking about possible combinations.\n\nFirst, maybe I can pair some numbers together. Let me try adding some. 37 + 46 is 83. That's close to 81, but 83-2 would be 81. But where do I get the 2? The remaining numbers are 22 and 68. Wait, 68 - 22 is 46. Oh, but 46 is already used. Hmm, maybe that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, if I take 68 - 22, that gives 46. Then, using 37 and 46, maybe? Wait, but I already used 46. Wait, the original numbers are 37, 46, 22, 68. So if I subtract 68 - 22 = 46, but I already have 46 as a separate number. That might not work since each number can only be used once. So maybe that approach is invalid.\n\nWhat if I do 68 - (something) to get closer. Let's think about multiplication. 22 * 3 is 66, but 3 isn't one of the numbers. Alternatively, 37 * 2 is 74, but again, 2 isn't there. Maybe division?\n\nLooking at 46 and 22. 46 divided by 22 is roughly 2.09. If I multiply that by 37, that's like 77.43, which isn't 81. Maybe not.\n\nAnother angle: Let's think of 81 as 80 +1. Maybe 68 + 22 is 90. Then subtract 9. But how to get 9 from the remaining numbers. The remaining numbers would be 37 and 46. 46 - 37 is 9. So 68 +22 =90, then subtract (46-37)=9: 90 -9=81. Let's check:\n\nSo equation would be (68 +22) - (46 -37) = 81. Wait, that uses all four numbers: 68,22,46,37. Let me compute that: 68+22 is 90. 46-37 is 9. 90-9=81. Yes! That works. So the equation is (68 + 22) - (46 - 37) = 81. Let me make sure all numbers are used once: 68,22,46,37. Yep, all four. The operations are addition and subtraction. So that should be the correct answer.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(68 + 22) - (46 - 37) = 81</answer>"}]}

First, let me list out the numbers again: 8, 58, 51, 58. Wait, two 58s? So I have to use each exactly once.\n\nLet me think about possible operations. Since 408 is a larger number, maybe multiplication is involved. Let's check if 58 multiplied by something gets close. 58 times 7 is 406, which is very close to 408. But how can I get a 7 from the remaining numbers? Let's see, the remaining numbers are 8, 51, and the other 58. Hmm, 51 minus 8 is 43. Not helpful. 58 minus 51 is 7! Oh, wait, 58 - 51 = 7. Then 58 * 7 would be 58 * (58 - 51) = 58*7 = 406. But 406 is 2 less than 408. Maybe add the remaining 8? But then I have to use all numbers. Wait, let's see: 58 * (58 - 51) + 8. That would be 406 + 8 = 414. Not 408. Close, but not quite.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 58 * 7 + 8? But again, that's 406 +8=414. Still not. Hmm. Maybe subtract something else. Wait, perhaps I can adjust the numbers. Let's see: 51 and 8. 51 - 8 is 43. 58 times 43 is way too big. 58 * 8 is 464. Then 464 plus 58 is 522. Not helpful. \n\nWhat if I combine the two 58s first? 58 +58=116. Then 116 * something. Let's see, 116 * 3.5 = 406. But how to get 3.5 from 51 and 8. 51/8 is 6.375. Not helpful. 8/51 is about 0.156. Not useful. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe 51 * 8 = 408. Oh! Wait, 51 multiplied by 8 is exactly 408! But then I have the two 58s left. How can I use them? Since I have to use all numbers, maybe subtract or add them in a way that cancels out? Like 51*8 +58 -58 = 408 +0=408. That might work. Let me check: 51*8 is 408. Then adding 58 and subtracting 58 cancels out. So equation would be 51*8 +58 -58 =408. But does that use all numbers? Yes: 51,8,58,58. Each used once. But is that allowed? The problem says each number can only be used once. So even though there are two 58s, each 58 is used once. So using both 58s as separate terms would be okay. So 58 -58 is zero, and 51*8 is 408. So 51*8 +58 -58 =408. That seems valid. But let me verify.\n\nYes, 51 multiplied by 8 is 408. Then adding 58 and subtracting 58 (so net zero) gives 408. So the equation would be (51 × 8) + 58 - 58 = 408. That uses all four numbers once each. Let me check the arithmetic again. 51*8=408. 408 +58=466. 466 -58=408. Yep. So that works. But maybe there's another way without having to subtract and add the same number. But since the problem allows using operations multiple times, as long as each number is used once, this should be acceptable. So the equation is 51×8 +58 -58 =408. But maybe written differently, like 51×8 + (58 -58). But that's the same thing. So that's a possible solution.\n</think>\n\n<answer>51 * 8 + 58 - 58 = 408</answer>"}]}

All numbers must be used once, and I can only use basic operations: +, -, *, /. Hmm. Let's start by thinking about the target number, 116. Maybe I can break it down into parts and see how these numbers can combine.\n\nFirst, let's look at the larger numbers: 61 and 67. If I subtract them, 67 - 61 = 6. That's not too helpful. If I add them, 67 + 61 = 128. That's over 116. Maybe 128 minus something. Then there's 12 and 1 left. 128 - 12 = 116. Oh! Wait, if I do 67 + 61 = 128, then subtract 12, that would be 128 - 12 = 116. But then what about the 1? Oh no, I need to use all four numbers. So that approach only uses three numbers. Hmm. So maybe that's not the way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe multiply some numbers. Let's see. 12 * something. 12*10 is 120, which is close. But how to get 10 from the remaining numbers. 67 - 61 = 6, then 6 + 1 = 7. Not 10. Alternatively, 61 - (67/ something). Wait, division might complicate things.\n\nWait, let's try combining 61 and 1 first. 61 + 1 = 62. Then multiply by 12? 62 * 12 is way too big. 744. No, that's not helpful. Maybe subtract: 61 -1 = 60. Then 60 * something. 60*2=120, but how to get 2 from 67 and 12. 12 - (67/x). Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 67 - (something). Let's see 67 - (12/1). That would be 67 -12=55. Then 61 +55=116. Wait, but then how? Let me check: 67 - (12/1) = 67-12=55. Then 55 +61=116. But here I used 67, 12, 1, and 61. Wait, that uses all four numbers. Wait, but how is the equation structured? Because order matters. So maybe (67 - (12 / 1)) + 61. Let's calculate that: 12/1=12, 67-12=55, 55+61=116. Yes! That works. So the equation is (67 - 12/1) +61 =116. But let me check if the operations are allowed. Division is allowed, and all numbers are used once: 67, 12, 1, 61. Yes. So that should be it. Let me just confirm the arithmetic:\n\n12 divided by 1 is 12. 67 minus 12 is 55. 55 plus 61 is 116. Perfect. So the equation is (67 - 12/1) +61 =116. But maybe there's another way to write it without the parentheses, but according to the rules, we need to use all numbers once with operations. Let me see if there's another possible arrangement, but this seems to work. Alternatively, maybe 67 +61 -12/1. That's the same thing. But the problem requires using all four numbers. Either way, that works. So the equation would be 67 + 61 - 12 / 1. Wait, but division has higher precedence, so it's 12/1 first. So yes, that works. So the answer would be (67 + 61) - (12 / 1) = 116. Alternatively, without the outer parentheses: 67 +61 -12/1. But probably better to include parentheses for clarity. Either way, it's correct. Let me check once more: 12 divided by 1 is 12, 67 plus 61 is 128, 128 minus 12 is 116. Yep, exactly. So the equation uses all four numbers once with division, subtraction, and addition. That should be the solution.\n</think>\n\n<answer>67 + 61 - 12 / 1 = 116</answer>"}]}

If I multiply 50 by something. Let's try 50*7, but again, 7 isn't here. But maybe 50* (something). Let's see the other numbers: 9, 44, 48. Maybe subtract something from 50 to get a number that when multiplied by another gives 338. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 44 is part of the equation. 44 times 8 is 352, which is higher. 44*7.5 is 330, but again, fractions. Hmm. Let me think of possible combinations.\n\nWhat if I use 48 and 50 first. 50 + 48 is 98. Then 98 times something. But 98*3 is 294, 98*4=392. 338 is between those. Not helpful. Or 50*48 is 2400, way too big. Maybe divide. 50/48 is about 1.04. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe subtract. 50 - 9 = 41. Then 41* something. 41*8 is 328, 41*8.2 is around 338. But 8.2 is not available. Maybe 44 - 48? That would be -4. Not useful. Alternatively, 44 + 48 = 92. Then 92 * something. 92*3.67 is around 338. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use multiplication and addition. Let's see: 48 * 9 = 432. Then 432 - (50 +44) = 432 -94= 338. Wait, that's 48*9 - (50 +44) = 432 -94=338. Let me check that. 48*9 is 432. 50+44 is 94. 432-94 is 338. Yes! That works.

Maybe adding something to it? 719 plus 100 would be 819, which is close to 831. Then we have 12 left. Wait, 831 minus 819 is 12. But we have 34 and 46 left. How can we get 12 from those? Let's see: 46 minus 34 is 12. So maybe 719 + 100 + (46 - 34) = 831. Let me check: 719 + 100 is 819, then 46 -34 is 12, so 819 +12 is 831. But wait, that uses all the numbers: 719, 100, 46, 34. Yes. So that would be 719 + 100 + (46 - 34) = 831. Let me write that as an equation: 719 + 100 + 46 - 34. Because subtraction is the same as adding the negative. So yes, that works. Let me verify:\n\n46 -34 is 12. Then 719 +100 is 819. 819 +12 is 831. Perfect! So the equation would be 719 + 100 + (46 - 34) = 831. Wait, but do I need to use all the operations? No, the problem just says each number is used once, and all numbers are used. Let me check the numbers: 719, 100, 46, 34. All are used. The operations are +, +, and -. So that's allowed. Yeah, that should work. Let me see if there's another way, just to be thorough.\n\nAlternatively, maybe multiplying some numbers. Let's see: 100 divided by something? 100/ something plus others. Let's say 719 + (100/ something) + others. Hmm. 100 divided by something. If I use 46 and 34, maybe. For example, 100 * (46 -34) = 100 *12 = 1200. Then 719 + 1200 is 1919, which is way over. Not helpful. Maybe subtract something. 719 * something? 719*1 is 719. 719*100 is way too big. 34 times 46 is 34*46. Let's calculate that: 34*40 is 1360, 34*6 is 204, total 1564. 1564 is too big. 719 + 1564 is way over. What about 46*34? Same as above. Maybe subtract. 46*100 = 4600. That's way too big. 719 - (100 +34 +46) would be 719 - 180 = 539. Not helpful. Hmm. Alternatively, 100 -34 is 66. 719 +66 is 785, then 46 left. 785 +46 is 831? Let me check: 719 + (100 -34) +46. So 719 +66 is 785, then +46 is 831. Yes! Wait, that's 719 + (100 -34) +46. Let me check the numbers: 719, 100, 34, 46. All used once. So that's 719 + (100 -34) +46 = 831. Let's compute step by step: 100-34 is 66. Then 719 +66 is 785. Then 785 +46 is 831. Yes, that works as well. So there's two possible equations here. Either 719 +100 + (46-34) or 719 + (100-34) +46. Both are valid. Which one is better? The first one uses addition and subtraction, the second one uses subtraction and addition. Since the problem allows any order as long as each number is used once, either should be acceptable. Let me check if the problem requires a specific order. The problem just says to use each number once with basic operations, so both equations are correct. But maybe the second one is more straightforward. Let me confirm again. The first approach: 719 +100 is 819. Then 46-34=12. 819+12=831. The second approach: 100-34=66, then 719+66=785, then +46=831. Both are correct. So either equation would work. Let me see if there's another possible way. Maybe multiplication. For example, 34*24 is 816, but we don't have 24. Wait, but we have 46. 46 divided by something? 46/2 is 23, but we don't have 2. Hmm. Maybe 100 - (something). Let's see, 719 +46 = 765. Then 765 + something. 831-765=66. So 66 needs to come from 100 and 34. 100 -34=66. So that's the same as the second approach. So yes, that's how that works. So the equation is 719 +46 + (100 -34) = 831. So, the equation could be written with different orders, but as long as all numbers are used once. So the answer can be either of those. Let me present one of them. The problem didn't specify order, so either is acceptable. Let's pick the first one I thought of: 719 + 100 + (46 -34) = 831. Let's check again: 719 +100 is 819. 46-34 is 12. 819 +12 is 831. Correct. So that's the equation. Alternatively, the other way: 719 + (100 -34) +46. Either way, but the problem might expect the numbers in the original order? Not sure. The numbers given are 719, 100, 34, 46. So the equation can be arranged in any order. Let me write it as 719 + 100 + 46 -34. Since subtraction is equivalent to adding negative, that's 719 +100 +46 -34. Which is same as (719 +100) + (46 -34). So that works. Therefore, the final equation is 719 + 100 +46 -34 = 831.\n</think>\n\n<answer>719 + 100 + 46 - 34 = 831</answer>"}]}

Let's see their approximate sizes. 183 is the largest, then 51, 50, and 22. Maybe I can subtract or add some combinations to reach 262.\n\nLet me start by trying to use 183, since it's the biggest. If I subtract something from 183, maybe I can get closer. Let's see: 262 is higher than 183, so maybe adding some of the other numbers to 183. For example, 183 + 50 = 233. That's still less than 262. Then 233 + 22 = 255. Hmm, still 7 short. But 255 + 7 = 262, but I don't have 7. Alternatively, maybe multiply some numbers.\n\nWait, 50 and 51 are close to each other. Let's see if using them together helps. 50 * 51 is 2550, which is way too big. Maybe 51 - 50 = 1. Then 183 + 1 = 184. Still not helpful. Maybe 50 divided by something? Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 183 - 22 = 161. Then 161 + 50 = 211. Then 211 +51=262. Wait, that works! Let me check: 183 - 22 = 161. Then 161 +50 =211. 211 +51=262. But wait, that uses all four numbers: 183, 22, 50, 51. But the operations would be 183 -22 +50 +51. Let me calculate that step by step.\n\n183 -22 is 161. Then 161 +50 is 211. 211 +51 is 262. Yes! So that's 183 - 22 + 50 +51 =262. But let me check if all numbers are used once: 22,183,50,51. Yes, all used once. And all operations are subtraction and addition. So this equation works. But wait, is that correct? Let me verify again:\n\n183 minus 22 is 161. Then 161 plus 50 is 211. Then 211 plus 51 is 262. Yep. So the equation is (183 - 22) + 50 + 51 =262.

Wait, the problem allows using the operations multiple times, but each number once. So this equation uses all numbers once and operations -, +, +. So yes.\n\nBut maybe another way? Let me check if there's another combination. For example, maybe using division or multiplication. Suppose 50*51 is 2550. Then 2550 / 22 is approximately 115.9. Then 115.9 +183 is about 298.9, which is way over. Not helpful. Alternatively, 183 - 51 = 132. Then 132 +50=182. 182 +22=204. No, not 262. Hmm.\n\nAnother idea: 50*22 = 1100. Then 1100 divided by something. 1100 / (183 -51) = 1100 /132 ≈8.333. Not helpful. Alternatively, 183* something. 183*1 is 183. If we do 183 + (50*51)/22. Let's compute 50*51=2550. 2550/22≈115.9. 183 +115.9≈298.9. Still not.\n\nWait, maybe subtract and add differently. For example: 183 +50=233. 233 +51=284. 284 -22=262. Oh! That's another way. Let me check: 183 +50 =233. 233 +51=284. 284 -22=262. So that would be 183 +50 +51 -22 =262. Let me verify the order: since addition and subtraction are left associative, this is equivalent to ((183 +50) +51) -22. Which is 233 +51=284, then 284-22=262. Yes, that works. So this uses all numbers once. So that's another equation. So either 183-22+50+51 or 183+50+51-22.\n\nBut since the problem allows any combination as long as each number is used once, either of these would work. Let me check if the problem requires parentheses or not. The example given is (1 + 2)/3. So maybe parentheses are acceptable. But in the first approach, the equation can be written as 183 - 22 + 50 +51 =262. But since addition and subtraction are left to right, it's the same as ( (183 -22) +50 ) +51. Alternatively, the second approach is 183 +50 +51 -22. Either way, it's the same result. So both equations would evaluate to 262.\n\nTherefore, the answer is one of these. Let me just confirm once again that all numbers are used once and the result is correct. For example, in the second equation: 183 +50 is 233, +51 is 284, minus 22 is 262. Correct. All numbers used once. So the equation is 183 +50 +51 -22 =262. Alternatively, the same as 183 + (50 +51) -22. Since addition is associative.\n\nTherefore, the equation can be written as 183 + 50 + 51 - 22 = 262. Let's check again the numbers: 183, 50, 51, 22. All used once. Correct. Operations are +, +, -. So that's acceptable. Therefore, the answer is 183 + 50 + 51 - 22 = 262. So the equation is (183 + 50) + (51 - 22) but that might not be necessary. Alternatively, since it's left to right, but perhaps writing it without parentheses is okay. The example in the problem uses parentheses, but maybe it's optional. However, the problem says \"return the final equation\", so perhaps the most straightforward way is 183 +50 +51 -22. But perhaps using parentheses for clarity. For example, (183 + 50) + (51 - 22). Let's compute: 183+50=233, 51-22=29, then 233+29=262. Yes, that works. So that's another way to write it. So either form is acceptable. The problem example includes parentheses, but maybe it's not necessary. Let's see.\n\nThe example given is (1 + 2)/3. So they used parentheses even though division has higher precedence. But in our case, if I write (183 + 50 +51) -22, which is the same as 183 +50 +51 -22. So parentheses here are optional. Alternatively, (183 + (50 +51)) -22. But perhaps the simplest way without unnecessary parentheses is 183 +50 +51 -22. But if I want to use parentheses as in the example, maybe group some terms. For instance, (183 +50) + (51 -22) = 233 +29=262. That works. So that's another way. Let me check: 51-22=29, 183+50=233, 233+29=262. Correct. So the equation could be written as (183 +50) + (51 -22) =262. This uses all numbers once and combines them with + and -, and uses parentheses as in the example. Since the example uses parentheses, perhaps this is the preferred format. \n\nSo I think the answer would be (183 + 50) + (51 - 22) = 262. Let me verify again: 51 -22=29, 183+50=233, 233+29=262. Yes, correct. All numbers used once. So that's the equation.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(183 + 50) + (51 - 22) = 262</answer>"}]}

Let me start by thinking about how these numbers can interact.\n\nFirst, let's look at the target number: 622. It's even, so maybe division isn't the main operation here. Let's see the numbers I have. The largest number is 778. If I subtract something from 778, maybe I can get close to 622. Let's see: 778 - 156 = 622. Hmm, so I need to make 156 from the remaining numbers 77, 20, and 99.\n\nWait, the remaining numbers after using 778 would be 77, 20, 99. Let me check if those can combine to 156. Let's see: 77 + 20 = 97; 97 + 99 = 196. That's too big. What if I subtract? 99 - 20 = 79; 79 +77=156. Oh! That works. So 99 - 20 = 79, then 79 +77=156. Then 778 -156=622. So putting that together: 778 - (77 + (99 -20)) = 622. Let me check the math:\n\nFirst, 99 minus 20 is 79. Then add 77: 79 +77=156. Subtract that from 778: 778 -156=622. Perfect!\n\nBut let me make sure all numbers are used exactly once: 778, 77, 99, 20. Yes, each is used once. So the equation is 778 - (77 + 99 -20). Wait, but in the order of operations, parentheses matter. Let me write it correctly. The expression would be 778 - (77 + (99 - 20)).\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write it without nested parentheses: (99 - 20) +77 = 156, so 778 - 156 = 622. So the equation is 778 - (77 + 99 - 20). Let me verify the arithmetic again:\n\n99 -20 is 79. 79 +77 is 156. 778 -156 is indeed 622. Yes! So this should work. Let me just check if I used all numbers once and only once. 778, 77, 99, 20. All are used. Great.\n\nSo the final equation would be 778 - (77 + 99 - 20) = 622. Alternatively, maybe written as 778 - 77 - (99 -20) to make the order clearer. Let's compute that: 778 -77 is 701. Then 99-20 is 79. So 701 -79 is 622. Wait, that's another way to arrange it. So 778 -77 - (99 -20). But that's using the same numbers. Let me check if that's equivalent.\n\nYes: 778 -77 -99 +20 = 778 -77 =701; 701 -99=602; 602 +20=622. Wait, that's different. Wait, that approach would be 778 -77 -99 +20. Let me calculate that: 778-77 is 701. 701-99 is 602. 602 +20=622. Oh! So that's another valid equation. So here, all numbers are used once, and the operations are subtraction and addition. So the equation would be 778 -77 -99 +20 =622. Let me check if that's correct. 778-77=701, 701-99=602, 602+20=622. Yes! So this also works. \n\nBut which one is better? The problem allows using each number once and all operations. The first approach uses parentheses, but the second uses a combination of subtraction and addition without parentheses. Let me see if the order of operations allows the second approach. Since subtraction and addition are left-associative, the expression 778 -77 -99 +20 would be evaluated as ((778 -77) -99) +20. Which is the same as 778-77=701; 701-99=602; 602+20=622. So that works.\n\nBut the problem allows using the operations one or multiple times. So either way is acceptable. The question is which one to present. Let me write both possibilities and see which is more straightforward.\n\nThe first equation: 778 - (77 + (99 -20)) =622. The second: 778 -77 -99 +20 =622. The second might be simpler to write without parentheses. Let me check if the second version is acceptable. Since all numbers are used once, and operations are applied as needed, yes.\n\nSo the answer could be written as 778 - 77 - 99 + 20 = 622. Let me confirm the arithmetic again. 778 minus 77 is 701. Then 701 minus 99 is 602. Then 602 plus 20 is 622. Correct. All numbers are used once. That's a valid equation. So that's the solution.\n</think>\n\n<answer>778 - 77 - 99 + 20 = 622</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using the numbers 84, 55, 100, and 87, each exactly once, with basic arithmetic operations, to get 152. Hmm. Let me start by thinking about the target number, 152. What combinations of these numbers could get me close to that?\n\nFirst, maybe adding some of the larger numbers. Let's see: 100 + 84 is 184, which is over. 87 + 55 is 142, that's 10 less. If I subtract those, but I need to use all numbers. Wait, I have to use all four numbers. So maybe combine addition and subtraction or multiplication and division.\n\nAlternatively, maybe multiplying some numbers. Let's see: 55 times 3 is 165, but I don't have a 3. Wait, 84 divided by something? Hmm. Let's think of possible operations.\n\nAnother approach: 152 is between 100 and 87. Maybe subtract 87 from something. If I take 100 and add 55, that's 155. Then subtract 3 to get 152. But where do I get 3 from? Using the remaining numbers 84 and 87. Wait, but I have to use all numbers. So if I do 100 +55 + something - something else... Wait, this might not be the right path.\n\nWait, 84 and 87 are both close to 80s. Let's see, 87 - 84 = 3. That's a small number. Then maybe 100 + 55 + (87 -84) = 100 +55 +3=158. No, that's 158. Not 152. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, 100 - 55 =45. Then 45 +84=129, then add 87? 129+87=216. Too big. Not helpful.\n\nWhat if multiply some numbers. For example, 55 * 2 =110, but again, how to get 2. 84 divided by 42 is 2, but I don't have 42. Alternatively, 100 divided by 50 is 2, but 55 is close. Wait, maybe 100 divided by (something) to get a multiplier.\n\nAlternatively, 84 + 87 = 171. Then subtract something. 171 -19=152. Where to get 19? 55 and 100. Maybe 100 -55=45. Not 19. Hmm. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe 100 - (55 - something). Let's see. Suppose I do 100 + 84 =184. Then subtract 87 -55=32. 184 -32=152. Wait, let me check that again. 100 +84 =184. Then 87 -55 is 32. 184 -32=152. But that uses all numbers: 100,84,87,55. So the equation would be 100 +84 - (87 -55) =152. Let's compute it step by step. 87-55=32. Then 100+84=184. 184-32=152. Yes, that works. So the equation is (100 + 84) - (87 - 55) =152.\n\nBut let me double-check if that uses all numbers once: 100, 84, 87, 55. Yes, each is used once. The operations are addition and subtraction. So this should work. Let me confirm the calculation:\n\nFirst, compute 87 -55: 32. Then 100 +84: 184. Subtract 32 from 184: 184 -32=152. Exactly. So that's the equation. So the answer would be (100 + 84) - (87 -55) =152. So putting that in the required tags.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(100 + 84) - (87 - 55) = 152</answer>"}]}

Let me start by thinking about how to combine these numbers.\n\nFirst, 381 is a relatively large number, so maybe multiplication will be involved to get there. Let's see what combinations could give a large product. The two largest numbers here are 45 and 16. Multiplying them gives 45*16=720. That's already over 381. If I subtract something from that, maybe. Let's see: 45*16=720. Then 720 minus something. But we need to use all the numbers. So maybe 45*16 - (7 and 3). Let's see. How can I use 7 and 3? If I subtract (7*3)=21, then 720-21=699. That's still too low. Hmm, not enough. Alternatively, maybe 45*16 - 7 -3=720-10=710. Still not 381. Maybe that's not the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider division. Let's see. If I take 45 divided by 3, that gives 15. Then 15*16=240. Then add 7: 240+7=247. No, still too low. Not helpful.\n\nWhat if I do 45*7=315. Then 16*3=48. Then 315+48=363. Close but still 18 short. Hmm. Maybe 45*7 +16*3 = 315 +48=363. Still not there.\n\nWait, perhaps combining operations in a different way. Let's think of 381 as 45 multiplied by something. Let's see: 45*8=360, 45*9=405. So 45*8.466...=381. But how to get 8.466 with the remaining numbers 16,7,3. Maybe (16+7)/3=23/3≈7.666... So 45*( (16+7)/3 )=45*(23/3)=345. Then 345 + something? But we have already used all numbers except 3, but 3 was used in the division. Wait, the numbers are 16,45,7,3. All must be used once. So if I have (16+7)/3, then that uses 16,7,3. Then multiply by 45. So that's 45*((16+7)/3) = 45*(23/3) = 345. Then how do I reach 381? 345 + 36=381. But where would 36 come from? We've already used all numbers. Alternatively, maybe there's another way.\n\nAlternatively, 45*(16 - 7) +3 = 45*9 +3=405+3=408. Not 381. Or 45*(16-7)-3=405-3=402. Still no.\n\nWait, maybe 16* (45 - (7*3))? Let's compute 7*3=21. 45-21=24. 16*24=384. Hmm, 384 is close to 381. Then 384-3=381. But wait, have I used all numbers? Let's check: 16,45,7,3. In this case, 7*3 uses 7 and 3, then 45-21 uses 45, then 16*(24) uses 16. Then subtract 3. Wait, but 3 was already used in 7*3. So that's using 3 twice. Not allowed. Each number once. So that's a problem.\n\nWait, maybe 45*(7) + 16*3. 45*7=315, 16*3=48. 315+48=363. Still not enough. 363 + 18=381. But where's 18 from? But we've used all numbers. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using division. Let's think: 45 / 3=15. Then 16*15=240. Then 240 +7=247. No. Not helpful.\n\nWait, what if I do 45 * (7 + (16 / 3))? Let's compute 16/3≈5.333. Then 7+5.333≈12.333. 45*12.333≈555. That's way over. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 16 * (45 - 7) - 3. Let's see: 45-7=38. 16*38=608. 608-3=605. Nope.\n\nWait, maybe 45* (16 - 3) -7. 16-3=13. 45*13=585. 585-7=578. No.\n\nWhat if I try 45 + 16*7*3? 16*7=112. 112*3=336. 45+336=381. Wait, that works! Let me check: 16*7=112. 112*3=336. Then 45+336=381. But have I used all numbers? Let's see: 45,16,7,3. Yes, each used once. So the equation would be 45 + 16*7*3. Wait, but 16*7*3 is 336, so 45 + 336 = 381. That's correct. But wait, does that use all operations? Well, it's 45 + (16 multiplied by 7 multiplied by 3). So the operations are two multiplications and one addition. Each number used once, and all numbers are used. Let me verify:\n\nNumbers: 16,45,7,3. All used. Operations: * (twice) and +. So yes. That seems to work. Let me check the arithmetic again: 16*7=112, 112*3=336. 45+336=381. Correct. So the equation is 45 + 16 * 7 * 3. But according to order of operations, the multiplications are done first, so parentheses aren't needed. But maybe I can write it as 45 + (16 * 7 * 3). But the user's example included parentheses even when not necessary, so maybe it's okay. Alternatively, maybe the user wants the equation as written with necessary parentheses. Since multiplication is associative, the order doesn't matter. So 45 + 16*7*3 is correct. Let me write that in the answer.\n</think>\n\n<answer>45 + 16 * 7 * 3</answer>"}]}

Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, 816 is a pretty big number. Let me see what operations could lead to that. Multiplication is probably necessary here because addition and subtraction would need really large numbers, which we don't have. Division might complicate things, but maybe if combined with multiplication.\n\nLet me check the product of the largest numbers first. 34 multiplied by 15 is 510. Then, 8 multiplied by 5 is 40. If I add those together, 510 + 40 = 550. That's way too low. What if I multiply them? 34 * 15 * 8 *5. Wait, that would be way too big. Let me calculate: 34*15 is 510, 510*8 is 4080, 4080*5 is 20400. That's way over. So multiplying all of them isn't the way.\n\nMaybe I need to combine operations. Let's see. What if I do 34 * (something with 5,8,15) to get 816. Let's see: 816 divided by 34 is 24. So if I can make 24 with 5,8,15. Hmm. How to get 24 from those three numbers?\n\nLooking at 15, 8, and 5. Let's see: 15 - 8 = 7, 7 +5=12. Not enough. 15 +8=23, 23 +5=28. Still not. 15 * (8 -5) = 15*3=45. That's too much. 15 - (8 +5)=2. Not helpful. Maybe 8/(15-5) = 8/10=0.8, then 15*0.8=12. Not 24.\n\nWait, maybe 15 + 8 +5=28. Still no. What if 15*(8 - (5))? 8-5=3, 15*3=45. No. 8* (15 -5) =8*10=80. Hmm. 80 divided by something? 80/5=16. But not helpful. Wait, maybe (15 +5) *8=20*8=160. Still not 24.\n\nAlternatively, 8/(something). Maybe 15/(5) =3, then 8*3=24. Oh! Wait, that's possible. So 15 divided by 5 is 3, then 8 multiplied by 3 is 24. Then 34*24=816. Let me check that:\n\n15 /5 =3, 8*3=24, 34*24=816. Yes! So the equation would be 34 * (8 * (15 /5)). Let me verify the numbers: 34, 15,5,8. All used once. Operations are division, multiplication, multiplication. So that works.\n\nAnother way to write it might be 34 * 8 * (15 /5). Let's compute: 15/5=3, 8*3=24, 34*24=816. Yep. So the equation is 34 * 8 * (15 /5). Alternatively, parentheses can be arranged differently, but the key is that the division is between 15 and5, and then multiplied by8 and34.\n\nI think that's the correct equation. Let me just check if there's another possible combination, but this seems to fit. Let me double-check the arithmetic:\n\n15 divided by 5 is 3. 8 multiplied by 3 is 24. 34 multiplied by 24: 34*20=680, 34*4=136, 680+136=816. Perfect. All numbers used once, and operations are allowed. So this should be the right answer.\n</think>\n\n<answer>34 * 8 * (15 / 5)</answer>"}]}

Hmm. Let's start by thinking about how these numbers can combine. Since one of the target numbers is 169, maybe that can be part of the equation directly. But I have to use all four numbers, so 169 can't just stand alone.\n\nLet me list out the numbers again: 58, 169, 31, 89. The target is 169. So perhaps subtract or add some combination of the other numbers to reach 169. Let's see. If I use 169 as part of the result, maybe I can structure it so that the other numbers somehow cancel out or add up appropriately. For example, 169 plus something minus something else equals 169. But that would require the other parts to net zero. Let's check that possibility.\n\nSo 169 + (something) - (something else) = 169. That would mean the something minus something else equals zero. So maybe (58 + 31) - 89? Let's calculate: 58 +31 is 89, so 89 -89 is zero. Then 169 + (89 -89) = 169. But wait, how do the numbers get arranged here? Let me try to write that as an equation. If I do 169 + (58 +31 -89), but that uses all four numbers? Wait, 58, 31, 89 are used, and 169. Yes. So 169 + (58 +31 -89) = 169 + (89 -89) = 169 +0 =169. That works. Let me verify each number is used once: 169, 58, 31, 89. All are used once. So the equation would be 169 + (58 +31 -89) =169. But since we need to use all the numbers in the equation, this seems to fit. Let me check the arithmetic again. 58+31 is 89, then 89 -89 is 0. Adding that to 169 gives 169. Yes. So that works. But wait, maybe the equation can be written as 169 +58 +31 -89. Let me compute that: 169 +58 is 227, plus 31 is 258, minus 89 is 169. Yes, that works. So the equation would be 169 +58 +31 -89 =169. Let me check if all numbers are used: 169,58,31,89. Yes, each once. So that's a valid equation. Alternatively, the parentheses could be arranged differently, but the order of operations might not matter here since it's all addition and subtraction. So the equation is 169 +58 +31 -89 =169. That seems correct. Let me see if there's another way. Maybe using multiplication or division. For instance, 89 is a prime number, so maybe dividing 58 by 31? Let's see. 58 divided by 31 is approximately 1.87. Then maybe 89 - (58/31) =89 -1.87...≈87.12. Then 87.12 + something? Not sure. Alternatively, 169 could be expressed as a combination of other numbers. Let's try 89 *2 is 178, which is higher than 169. 89 +58 is 147, which is lower. 89 +58=147, plus 31=178, which again is over. So maybe 89 +58=147, then 169 -147=22, but how to get 22 from the remaining numbers? Wait, but we need to use all numbers. Alternatively, maybe (89 -58) * something. 89-58=31. So 31 * something. But 31 is one of the numbers, so that's already used. So 31* (something) equals 169. But 31*5.45≈169. Not helpful. Alternatively, 169 divided by 31 is approximately 5.45. Not helpful. Maybe 89* (58 -31) divided by something. Let's see: 58-31=27. 89*27=2403. Then divide by something to get 169. 2403 /14.18≈169. But 14.18 is not a number we have. Hmm. Maybe that's not the right approach. Let me go back to the first idea where it's straightforward addition and subtraction. The equation 169 +58 +31 -89=169. Let me confirm this again: 169 +58=227, 227+31=258, 258-89=169. Correct. So that uses all four numbers once each, and the result is 169. So that's a valid equation. Therefore, the answer is (169 +58 +31 -89)=169. But since we need to write it in an equation form using all the numbers with operations, and each number once, this works. Another way could be 169 + ((58 +31) -89). But that's the same as the previous, just with parentheses added. Since addition and subtraction are left associative, the parentheses might not be necessary. But to present it clearly, maybe with parentheses: (58 +31) gives 89, then 89 -89=0, so 169 +0=169. So the equation would be 169 + (58 +31 -89). But written as 169 +58 +31 -89. Either way, it's correct. Let me check if there's another combination. For example, 89 * (31 - (169 /58)). Let's see: 169 divided by58 is approximately 2.913. 31 -2.913≈28.087. Then 89*28.087≈2499. Which is way over. Not helpful. Alternatively, 89 +58=147, 169 -31=138. Then 147 +138=285. Not helpful. Maybe 58 -31=27, then 89 -27=62. 62*something? No. Alternatively, 89 * (58 -31) / something. Wait, 58-31=27. 89*27=2403. 2403 divided by 14.2 is 169. But we don't have 14.2. Alternatively, 2403 divided by (something). The remaining number is 169. 2403 /169≈14.2. Not an integer. So that's not helpful. So maybe the first approach is the only viable one. Let me just confirm that in the equation 169 +58 +31 -89, all numbers are used once. Yes: 169,58,31,89. All present. The arithmetic works. So that's the answer.\n</think>\n\n<answer>169 + 58 + 31 - 89 = 169</answer>"}]}

Hmm, let's start by thinking about the target number. 595 is a bit over 500, so maybe multiplication will be involved here. Let's see.\n\nFirst, let me check if any of these numbers can multiply to get close to 595. Let's see:\n\n26 * 58 = 1508, which is way too big. 26 * 77 is 2002, also too big. 26 * 85 is 2210. So that's not helpful. How about 58? 58 * 10 is 580, which is close to 595. So 58 * 10 is 580, but how to get 10 from the remaining numbers? Wait, the remaining numbers would be 26, 77, 85. Hmm, but 85 - 77 = 8, and 26 divided by something... Maybe not. Alternatively, maybe 77 - 26 = 51, and 51 divided by something. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 85 is a good number to use. 85 * 7 is 595. Oh! Because 85 * 7 = 595 exactly. So if I can use 85 and then somehow get 7 from the remaining numbers 26, 58, 77. Let's see.\n\nSo how to make 7 from 26, 58, 77. Let's see. 77 - 58 = 19. Then 26 - 19 = 7. Wait, that's 77 minus 58 equals 19, then 26 minus 19 equals 7. So combining that, that would be 26 - (77 - 58) = 7. Then multiply that by 85: 85 * (26 - (77 - 58)) = 85 * (26 - 19) = 85 * 7 = 595. Let me check:\n\n77 - 58 is 19. 26 - 19 is 7. 85 * 7 is 595. Yes, that works. But do I have all numbers used once? Let me check: 85 is used, 26, 77, 58. Yes, all four numbers are used once each. So the equation would be 85 * (26 - (77 - 58)) = 595. Let me write that as (85 * (26 - (77 - 58))) but maybe the parentheses can be arranged differently. Alternatively, maybe without the inner parentheses if order of operations allows. But since subtraction is left associative, we need the parentheses.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 77 - 58 is 19, then 26 - 19 is 7, then 85 * 7. So yes, that's the same as 85 * (26 - 77 + 58). Wait, because 26 - (77 - 58) is 26 -77 +58. Let's check: 26 -77 +58 = (26 +58) -77 = 84 -77 =7. So another way to write it is 85 * (26 +58 -77). Let me verify that:\n\n26 +58 = 84; 84 -77 =7; 85*7=595. Yes, that works. So that equation would be 85*(26 +58 -77) = 595. Let's check the numbers used: 85,26,58,77. All used once. Perfect.\n\nSo the equation is 85*(26 +58 -77) = 595. Alternatively, maybe using division somewhere else, but this seems to work. Let me check if there's another possible combination, but this seems straightforward.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe 58 * 10 + 15 = 595, but 58*10 is 580, 580+15=595. But how to get 10 and 15 from the remaining numbers. Let's see, but that would require splitting the numbers into parts, which isn't allowed since each number must be used whole once. Alternatively, maybe (85 + 77) * something. 85+77=162. 162*3.67≈595, but that's not an integer. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 77*8 = 616, which is close. 77*8=616, then subtract 21 to get 595. But 21 from 26,58,85. Hmm, 85-58=27, 27-26=1. Not helpful. Alternatively, 58-26=32, 32- something. Not sure.\n\nAnother angle: 595 divided by 85 is 7. So if I can make 7 from the other numbers. Which is exactly what I did earlier. So that seems the best path. Therefore, the equation is 85*(26 +58 -77) = 595.\n</think>\n\n<answer>85 * (26 + 58 - 77) = 595</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using the numbers 42, 78, 85, and 83, each exactly once, with basic arithmetic operations, to equal 312. Hmm, let's start by thinking about what combinations might get close to 312.\n\nFirst, 312 is a bit over 300. Let's check the sum of all numbers: 42 + 78 is 120, and 85 +83 is 168. Adding those together gives 288. That's under 312. Maybe multiplication can help here. Let's see which numbers multiplied could get close.\n\nLooking at 78 and 42, 78*42 is 3276, which is way too big. Maybe 85 and 83? 85*83 is 7055, definitely too big. So multiplication of two numbers might not be the way. Maybe combining addition and subtraction with multiplication.\n\nAnother approach: Let's think about factors of 312. 312 divided by 12 is 26, but not sure. Wait, 312 is 24*13, but maybe breaking it down into parts. Alternatively, 312 is 78 multiplied by 4. Wait, 78 is one of the numbers. So 78*4=312. But do we have a 4? Hmm, maybe we can create 4 from the other numbers: 42, 85, 83. Let's see. 85 - 83 = 2. Then 42 divided by (85 -83) would be 42/2=21. Not helpful. Wait, 85 -83 =2, then 42 -2=40. Still not 4. Alternatively, 83 -42=41, 85-78=7. Not helpful. Maybe 85 - (83 -42) = 85 -41=44. Still not. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, if we can use 78 as a multiplier, maybe 78*(something) =312. So 312 divided by78 is 4. So we need to get 4 from the remaining numbers: 42,85,83. How? Let's see. Maybe (85 -83) =2, and then 42 / (85-83) =21. That gives 21, which is 42/(2). But that's 21, which is not 4. Hmm. Alternatively, 85 - (83 +42) =85 -125= -40. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe combining subtraction and division. For example, (85 - 83) =2, then 42 divided by that 2 is 21. So 78 *21 would be 1638, way too big. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, using addition and subtraction. Let's try combining the numbers. Maybe 85 +83 =168, 78 +42=120. 168 +120=288. That's 24 less than 312. So how to get 24 more? Maybe if instead of adding, subtract something. Wait, but all numbers must be used once. So maybe instead of 85 +83 +78 +42=288, can we adjust some operations?\n\nWhat if we do 85* something. Let's say 85*3=255. Then 312-255=57. Do we have 57 from the remaining numbers? 78,83,42. 78-42=36. 36+ (83- something?) Not sure. Alternatively, 85*4=340, which is 28 over. 340 -28=312. How to get 28 from 78,83,42. 83- (78-42)=83-36=47. Not 28. Alternatively, 78 - (83 -42)=78-41=37. No. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe 83 -42=41. Then 78 -41=37. 85 +37=122. 85 + (78 - (83-42))=85+37=122. Not helpful. Maybe combining in a different way.\n\nAnother idea: 85 +83 =168. 168*2=336. 336-24=312. How to get 2 and 24? But we have 78 and 42 left. 78-42=36. Not 24. Hmm. Maybe 78/ something. 78 divided by 3.25 is 24, but 3.25 would be 13/4. Not sure. Alternatively, 42/(85-83)=21. 78-21=57. 85-57=28. Not useful.\n\nWait, let's try a different approach. Let's look at possible ways to get close to 312 with combinations. For example:\n\nIf I take 85 * 3.6 = 306. But how to get 3.6. Maybe 78 / (83 -42) =78/41≈1.9. Not 3.6. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, 83 * 3 =249. Then 312 -249=63. Need to get 63 from 78,85,42. 85 - (78 -42)=85-36=49. Not 63. 78 -42=36. 85-36=49. Still not.\n\nWait, what if we do 78 * (85 - 83) =78*2=156. Then 156 +42=198. Not enough. Or 156 *2=312, but how to get 2? 85-83=2, but already used 85 and83 in that calculation. Wait, maybe:\n\n(78 * (85 -83)) + (42). So that's 78*2 +42=156+42=198. Still not.\n\nAlternatively, 78 * (85 - (83 -42)). Let's compute inside: 83-42=41. 85-41=44. 78*44=3432. Way too big.\n\nWait, maybe subtract instead. 85 - (83 -42)=85-41=44. Then 44*78=3432. No. Hmm.\n\nWhat if we use division. Let's say 85/83 is approximately 1.024. Multiply by 42? 42*1.024≈43. Then 43 +78=121. Not close.\n\nAlternatively, 78/42=1.857. 1.857* (85-83)=3.714. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe (85 +83) * something. 85+83=168. 168 * something=312. 312/168≈1.857. So 1.857 is 78/42. Exactly, 78/42=1.857. So 168*(78/42) =168*(13/7)= (168/7)*13=24*13=312! Oh! Wait, that works. Let's check:\n\n(85 +83) * (78 /42) =168 * (78/42). Simplify 78/42=13/7. 168*(13/7)=24*13=312. Yes! So the equation would be (85 +83) * (78 /42) =312. Let's check if all numbers are used once: 85,83,78,42. Yes. Each is used once. Operations are +, *, /. So that's valid.\n\nWait, but does the order matter? Let me calculate:\n\nFirst, 85+83=168. Then 78 divided by42=1.857... Then multiply 168 by that. 168*1.857≈312. So exact value is 312. Yes, because 78 divided by42 is 13/7, and 168*(13/7)=24*13=312. Perfect.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(85 + 83) * (78 / 42) = 312</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using 6, 12, 66, and 27, each exactly once, with basic operations, and it has to equal 369. Hmm. Let's start by thinking about the target number, 369. That's a pretty large number, so maybe multiplication is involved here. Let's look at the numbers given: 66 is the largest, so maybe that can be part of a multiplication.\n\nIf I multiply 66 by something, let's see. 66 multiplied by 5 is 330, which is less than 369. 66*6 would be 396, which is over. But 66*5.5 would be 363, but we don't have 5.5. Wait, maybe combining other numbers with 66. Let's see what's available. The other numbers are 6, 12, and 27. Maybe 66 plus something, but 369-66 is 303, so that leaves 303 to make with 6, 12, 27. Not sure. Alternatively, maybe 66 multiplied by 6 is 396, and then subtract something. 396 - 27 is 369, but then I have to use 12 as well. Wait, but if I do 66*6 - 27, that uses 66,6,27, but leaves out 12. So that's a problem because all numbers must be used.\n\nAlternatively, let's see if I can use 27 somehow. 27 is a bit over a quarter of 100. Maybe 27*13 is 351, but that's not helpful. Wait, 27 multiplied by 12 is 324. Then 324 plus 45 is 369. Where would 45 come from? 45 could be 66 - 21, but 21 isn't directly available. Wait, maybe 66 - (something). Let me think.\n\nAnother approach: Let's consider combining 12 and 6. 12 +6=18, but not sure. 12*6=72. Maybe 72 plus 27 is 99, then 99* something. 99*3.727... Hmm, not helpful. Alternatively, 12*27=324. Then 324 + 45=369. Again, 45 from 66-21, but how to get 21. Wait, 6 and 12: 12-6=6, but 66-6=60. Hmm, not helpful. Maybe 66 - (something). Alternatively, 66 divided by something. 66/6=11. Then 11* something. 11*33.545... Not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to combine operations. Let's try different combinations. For example, 66 * 6 = 396. Then 396 - 27 = 369. But then how to use 12? Oh, wait, I can't leave 12 unused. So maybe that approach won't work. Unless there's a way to include 12 into the equation without affecting the result. Like, 66*6 - 27 + 12 -12, but that's using 12 twice. No, can't do that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use division. For example, 66 divided by something. Let's say 66/(12/6) = 66/2=33. Then 33*27=891, which is way too big. Not helpful. Or 27 divided by something. 27/(12/6) =27/2=13.5. Then 66*13.5=891. Still too big.\n\nWait, another angle: 369 divided by 66 is approximately 5.59. Not helpful. 369 divided by 27 is around 13.666. 27*13 is 351, which is 369-18. Hmm. Maybe 27*13 +18=369. Where would 18 come from? 12+6=18. So that's 27*(12+6) + 66? Wait, let me check. 12+6=18. 27*18=486. 486+66=552. No, too big. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe 27*12=324. Then 324 + something. 324+45=369. So how to get 45? 66 - 21=45. But where does 21 come from? 6+12+something? Not sure. Wait, 66 - (27 - 6) = 66 -21=45. Then 27*12 + (66 - (27 -6)). Wait, but that uses 27 twice. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 66 + 27=93. 93*4=372, which is close. 4 is not directly available. 12/3=4, but 3 isn't a given number. Alternatively, 12-6=6. So 93*(12-6)=93*6=558. Not helpful.\n\nHmm, maybe trying to use parentheses for order of operations. Let's think. For example, 66 * (12 - 6) = 66*6=396. Then 396 - 27=369. But again, that leaves out the 27 and uses 6,12,66, but then 27 is subtracted. Wait, so 66*(12-6) -27 = 369. Let's check: 12-6=6, 66*6=396, 396-27=369. Yes! But wait, have we used all the numbers? Let's see: 66,12,6 are used in 66*(12-6), then subtract 27. So yes, all four numbers: 6,12,66,27. Each used once. That works! Let me verify: 12-6=6. 66*6=396. 396-27=369. Yes. So the equation is 66*(12 -6) -27 = 369. So that would be written as (66 * (12 - 6)) - 27 = 369. But let me check the arithmetic again. 12-6 is 6. 66*6 is 396. 396-27 is 369. Exactly. So that works. So the equation is (66 * (12 - 6)) - 27 = 369. Let me make sure all numbers are used: 66,12,6 (inside the parentheses), and 27. Yes, all four. Perfect.\n</think>\n\n<answer>66 * (12 - 6) - 27 = 369</answer>"}]}

All numbers must be used once, and I can only use basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Hmm. Let me start by thinking about the target number, 140. What combinations of these numbers could get close to that?\n\nFirst, the largest number here is 63. If I can multiply that by something, maybe. Let's see: 63 * 2 = 126, which is less than 140. 63 * 3 is 189, which is too big. So maybe 63 multiplied by something else. But I need to use all numbers. Let me think about other operations.\n\n26 is another big number. Maybe subtract something from 26? Or add? Wait, 26 + 63 is 89. That's not close. Maybe 63 minus 26 is 37. Still not helpful. Let's try multiplying 26 by something. 26*6 is 156. 156 is bigger than 140. Then maybe subtract something from 156. If I have 26*6 = 156, then subtract, say, 9 or 63. Wait, 156 - 63 is 93, which is not 140. 156 -9=147. Closer. 147 is 7 away. Hmm. But how to get 140 from there. Maybe another approach.\n\nWhat if I do 63 + 26? That's 89. Then multiply by something? 89*2=178, which is too big. Maybe divide? Not sure. Let's see. 63 divided by 9 is 7. So 63 /9 =7. Then maybe 26*7=182. Then subtract something. Wait, 26*(63/9) =26*7=182. Then 182 - something. What's left is 6. 182 -6=176. No, not 140. Alternatively, maybe subtract 42? But I don't have 42. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, 63 - 9 =54. Then 54 multiplied by something. 54*6=324. That's way too big. Maybe 54 divided by something? 54/6=9. Then 26 +9=35. Not helpful.\n\nWait, what about combining 63 and 6? 63*6=378. That's way too high. But maybe divide by something. 378 / (26 -9) = 378/17 ≈22.23. Not helpful.\n\nWait, let me list all possible operations between pairs and see.\n\nFirst, possible multiplications:\n\n26*6=156\n\n26*9=234\n\n26*63=1638 (way too big)\n\n6*9=54\n\n6*63=378\n\n9*63=567\n\nDivisions:\n\n26/6≈4.333\n\n26/9≈2.888\n\n26/63≈0.412\n\n6/9≈0.666\n\n63/9=7 (this seems useful)\n\n63/6=10.5\n\nSubtractions:\n\n26-6=20\n\n26-9=17\n\n26-63=-37\n\n6-9=-3\n\n63-9=54\n\n63-6=57\n\nAdditions:\n\n26+6=32\n\n26+9=35\n\n26+63=89\n\n6+9=15\n\n6+63=69\n\n9+63=72\n\nSo looking for combinations where operations can chain to 140.\n\nHmm. Let's think about 63/9=7, which is a clean division. Then maybe 7 multiplied by 20 is 140. How to get 20? 26-6=20. So putting that together: (26 -6) * (63 /9) =20 *7=140. Wait, that uses 26,6,63,9. Exactly all numbers once each. Let me check:\n\n26 -6 =20\n\n63 /9 =7\n\n20 *7 =140. Yes! That works. So the equation would be (26 -6) * (63 /9) =140. Let me verify all numbers are used once: 26,6,63,9. Yes, all used. So that's the equation.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(26 - 6) * (63 / 9) = 140</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using all the numbers 67, 72, 13, and 9 exactly once, with basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) any number of times, and the result should be 37. Hmm. Alright, let's start by thinking about possible combinations.\n\nFirst, 37 is a prime number, so maybe subtraction or addition could get me there. Let's see. Let's consider the larger numbers first. 72 and 67. If I subtract them, 72 - 67 is 5. That's small. If I add them, that's 139, which is way too big. Maybe multiply or divide? 72 divided by something? Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe if I can get numbers close to 37 by combining some of these. For example, 72 minus something. Let's try 72 - 35 = 37. How can I get 35 from the remaining numbers 67, 13, 9. Wait, but I can't use 67 again. Wait, no, I have to use all numbers. So if I use 72 in one part, the other numbers 67, 13, 9 need to be used in another part.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 67 minus something. 67 - 30 = 37. How to get 30 from 72, 13, 9. Hmm. 72 divided by (something) maybe? 72 divided by 2.4 is 30, but I don't have 2.4. Wait, 13 minus 9 is 4. 72 divided by 4 is 18. Then 67 - 18 is 49. Not 37. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe combining 13 and 9. 13 +9=22. 72-22=50. 67-50=17. Not helpful. Or 13*9=117. Then 117 -72=45. 67-45=22. Still not 37.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 72 divided by something. Let's see, 72 divided by (13 - 9) is 72/4=18. Then 67 -18=49. Still not 37.\n\nHmm. What if I use division with 67 and another number. 67 divided by something. Like 67/13 is about 5.15, not helpful. 67/9 is around 7.44. Maybe subtract that from 72. 72 - 7.44 is around 64.56. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe (72 - 67) =5. Then 13*5=65. Then 65 -9=56. No, that's 56. Not 37.\n\nAlternatively, (72 - 67) =5. Then 13 -9=4. 5*4=20. Not 37.\n\nHmm. Maybe using subtraction and division together. Let's see: 67 - (72 / (13 -9)). Wait, 13-9=4, 72/4=18, 67-18=49. Still not.\n\nWait, perhaps (72 - 13) =59. Then 59 - (67-9)=59 -58=1. Not helpful.\n\nOr 72 - (13 +9) =72-22=50. Then 67 -50=17. No.\n\nAlternatively, 13*9=117. Then 117 -72=45. Then 67-45=22. Still no.\n\nWait, maybe division and multiplication. Let's think: 67 - (72 / 13) +9. Let's calculate that. 72 divided by 13 is approximately 5.538. So 67 -5.538 ≈61.462 +9≈70.462. Not 37.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (67 - 72) + (13 *9). That would be -5 + 117=112. Nope.\n\nHmm. Maybe trying a different approach. Let's see, 37 is a prime number. So maybe combining operations. Let's consider using fractions. For example, 13*(something) to get close. 13*3=39. 39-2=37. How can I get 3 and 2 from the remaining numbers. Wait, 9-6=3, but we don't have a 6. Wait, 72 divided by something. 72/24=3. How to get 24 from 67 and the other numbers. Hmm, not straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, 72 - 67=5. 5*13=65. 65 -9=56. Still not.\n\nWait, maybe (72 - 67) * (13 -9). That's 5*4=20. Not 37.\n\nAlternatively, 72 divided by 9 is 8. Then 8*13=104. 104 -67=37. Oh! Wait, that uses all numbers. Let's check:\n\n72 / 9 =8.\n\n8 *13 =104.\n\n104 -67=37.\n\nYes! So the equation would be (72 / 9) * 13 -67 =37.

It's a bit over 200, so maybe multiplication or addition of the larger numbers could get me close.\n\nFirst, let's look at the numbers I have: 7, 9, 58, 18. The largest numbers here are 58 and 18. If I multiply 58 by something, maybe that could get close. Let's try 58 * 3.5 = 203. But 3.5 would require using 7 and 9 or 18. Wait, 7 divided by 2 is 3.5. But I don't have a 2. Alternatively, maybe 58 multiplied by (something) plus or minus another number equals 203.\n\nLet me check: 58 * 3 = 174. Then 203 - 174 = 29. But I need to make 29 from the remaining numbers 9, 7, 18. Hmm, 18 + 9 + 7 = 34. That's too much. Maybe subtract? 18 + (9 -7) = 20. Not enough. Alternatively, 18 + 9 =27, 27 -7=20. Still not 29. So maybe that approach isn't working.\n\nAlternatively, 58 * 4 =232. That's more than 203. 232 - 203=29. Again, same problem. So maybe not the best path.\n\nWhat if I use 58 and 18 together. 58 + 18=76. Then 76 * something. 76*2=152, 76*3=228. 228 is close to 203. 228 -25=203. But how to get 25 from 7 and 9? 7*3 + 9=30. No. 9*3 -7=20. Not 25. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe a different combination. Let's try 18 * 9=162. Then 203-162=41. So need 41 from 58 and 7. 58 -7=51. Not 41. 58 /7 is about 8.28. Not helpful. Alternatively, 7 * something. 7*5=35. 35+6=41. But I don't have a 5 or 6. Hmm.\n\nAnother angle: 58 + 18=76. Then 76 * (9 -7)=76*2=152. 152 + 51=203? Wait, but 51 would need to come from remaining numbers. But already used 58,18,9,7. So that's not possible. Maybe that's not the way.\n\nWait, perhaps using division. Let's see: 58 divided by something. For example, 58 / (something) = maybe a number that when multiplied by another gives 203. Let's see. 203 is a prime number? Wait, 203 divided by 7 is 29. So 7*29=203. Hmm, interesting. So if I can make 29 from 9, 58, 18. Let's see. 58 - (18 +9)=58-27=31. Close. 58 - 18 -9=31. No. 58 - (18* something). 18*1.6=28.8. Not helpful. How about 18 +9=27. 27 + (58 - 27)=58. Not helpful.\n\nWait, but if 7*29=203, then maybe 7*(58 - 29). Wait, 58 -29=29. That's 7*29=203, but how to get 29 from 9 and 18? 18 + 9 + (something). Wait, but 18 and 9. If I do 18 +9=27. Then 27 + (something) to get 29. But I need to use all numbers. Wait, but I already used 7, 58. So maybe 58 - (18 +9) =31. Then 7*31=217. That's too big. Not 203.\n\nAlternatively, 58 - (18 +9 +7)=58-34=24. 24* something. Not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps (58 + 18) * something. 76 * something. Let's see, 76 *2 =152. 203-152=51.

Let's see: 58 * 3.5=203. So how can I get 3.5 from 9,18,7. 7 divided by 2 is 3.5. But 2 comes from where? Maybe 18 divided by9=2. Then 7/(18/9)=7/2=3.5. So then 58*(7/(18/9))=58*(7/2)=58*3.5=203. Let's check that.\n\nBreaking it down: 18 divided by9=2. Then 7 divided by2=3.5. Then 58*3.5=203. Yes! So the equation would be 58 * (7 / (18 / 9)) = 203. Let's check the numbers used: 58,7,18,9. All used once. Operations are division inside the parentheses first (18/9), then division (7 divided by that result), then multiplication. So that's valid. Let me verify the calculation:\n\n18 /9 =2.\n\n7 /2=3.5.\n\n58 *3.5=58*(7/2)= (58*7)/2=406/2=203. Exactly.\n\nSo that works. Therefore, the equation is 58 × (7 ÷ (18 ÷ 9)) = 203.\n</think>\n\n<answer>58 * (7 / (18 / 9)) = 203</answer>"}]}

I need to use the numbers 17, 619, 25, and 1 each exactly once, and combine them with basic arithmetic operations to get 662. Hmm, let's start by thinking about possible combinations.\n\nFirst, 619 is a pretty big number. Maybe I can use that as a base and see how to adjust it with the other numbers. Let me try subtracting or adding. If I subtract 17 from 619, that would be 602. Then maybe add 25 and 1. But 602 + 25 is 627, plus 1 is 628. That's not enough. What if I subtract something else?\n\nAlternatively, maybe multiply some numbers. 25 times 17 is 425. That's too low. 619 minus 25 is 594, then plus 17 is 611, plus 1 is 612. Still not 662. Wait, maybe I need to use division. Let's see. 619 divided by something? 619 divided by 1 is still 619. Then add 25 and 17. 619 +25=644 +17=661. Oh, that's close to 662. Only one off. Hmm. Maybe there's a way to adjust that. Wait, 619 + (25*17) would be 619 + 425 = 1044, which is way too high. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe I need to subtract something. Let's see. If I do 619 + 25 = 644. Then I have 17 and 1 left. How can I get from 644 to 662 using 17 and 1. The difference is 18. So 17 +1 =18. So 644 +17 +1=662. But wait, that uses all numbers: 619 +25 +17 +1=662. Wait, adding all of them. Let me check: 619+25 is 644, plus 17 is 661, plus 1 is 662. Oh! That works! Wait, but the problem says each number can only be used once and all must be used. So 619 +25 +17 +1=662. That's just addition. But I need to use all four numbers with each used once, and the operations can be +, -, *, / but maybe I can use them in any combination. But adding all of them seems straightforward. Wait, let me check if that's allowed. The problem says \"using basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) one or multiple times\". So adding them all together would require using the '+' operator three times. So the equation would be 619 + 25 + 17 + 1 = 662. But let me confirm the sum: 619 +25 is 644, +17 is 661, +1 is 662. Yes, that adds up. But wait, the example given in the problem was (1 + 2) / 3, which uses parentheses. Do I need to use parentheses here? If I just write 619 +25 +17 +1, that's valid, right? But maybe the problem expects combining them in a way that's not just straight addition. Let me check again the numbers. Maybe there's another way. Let's see. If I try 619 - 17 = 602. Then 25 *1 =25. 602 +25=627. Not enough. Or 25 -1=24, 602 +24=626. Still no. What if I do 25 * (17 +1). That's 25*18=450. Then 619 -450=169. Not helpful. Alternatively, 619 - (25*17) = 619 -425=194. Then 194 +1=195. Not 662. Hmm. Maybe division. Let's see. 619 divided by 1 is 619. Then add 25 and 17. Wait, that's the same as before. 619 +25 +17 +1=662. So that works. Maybe the answer is simply adding all of them. But I need to check if that's acceptable. The problem says \"create an equation that equals 662\", and the example uses parentheses but the answer here would be straightforward. Let me verify the numbers: 619, 25, 17, 1. All used once. Operations: three additions. So that should be acceptable. So the equation would be 619 + 25 + 17 + 1 = 662. But maybe the problem expects a more complex equation. Let me think again. What if I do something like 619 + (25 * (17 -1)). Let's compute that: 17-1=16, 25*16=400, 619+400=1019. Too big. Not helpful. How about 619 - (25 * (17 -1))? 25*16=400, 619-400=219. Not 662. Alternatively, maybe (619 -17) * (25 -1). Wait, 619-17=602, 25-1=24. 602*24 is way too big. 602*24=14,448. No. Not useful. Hmm. Alternatively, 619 + (25 - 17) *1. That's 25-17=8, 8*1=8. 619+8=627. Not 662. Or 619 +25*(17 -1). Wait, that's the same as before. 25*16=400. 619+400=1019. No. Hmm. What if I use division. Let's see: 619 /1 is 619. Then 25*17=425. 619 +425=1044. No. Alternatively, 25/1=25, 619 +25=644, +17=661. Then 661 +1=662. So same as before. So perhaps the simplest way is just adding all four numbers. Since that works, maybe that's the intended answer. Let me check once again. 619 +25=644, +17=661, +1=662. Yes. So the equation would be 619 +25 +17 +1 = 662. Therefore, the answer is <answer>619 + 25 + 17 + 1</answer>.\n</think>\n\n<answer>619 + 25 + 17 + 1</answer>"}]}

The largest numbers here are 95 and 84. Maybe if I multiply those two? Let's check: 95 * 84 = 7980. That's way too big. So that's not going to work. Maybe subtract something from that product? But even subtracting the next numbers, like 21 and 14, 7980 -21 -14 = 7945, which is still way off. So multiplying the two largest numbers isn't the way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe adding 95 and 84 first? 95 +84 = 179. Then I still have 14 and 21 left. 179 +14 +21 = 214. Still too small. Not close to 549. Maybe multiplying some of the other numbers. Let's see.\n\nWhat if I take 95 and multiply by something. Let's think: 95*6 = 570. Hmm, 570 is close to 549. So 95*6 is 570. Then 570 minus 21 is 549. But how do I get 6 from the remaining numbers? The remaining numbers would be 84, 14, 21. Wait, but I need to use all four numbers. So 95 is used, then I need to create 6 from 84,14,21. Let's see: 84 divided by 14 is 6. Yes! So 84 /14 =6. Then 95*(84/14) =95*6=570. Then subtract 21: 570 -21=549. But wait, that uses 95,84,14,21. All four numbers. Let me check: 95*(84/14) -21 = 95*6 -21 =570-21=549. Yes! That works. So the equation is 95 multiplied by (84 divided by 14) minus 21 equals 549. Let me verify each number is used once: 95,84,14,21. Yes. All used. Operations are division, multiplication, subtraction. That should be it.\n</think>\n\n<answer>95 * (84 / 14) - 21 = 549</answer>"}]}

I need to use the numbers 110, 16, 77, and 82 each exactly once, combining them with basic arithmetic operations to get 121. Hmm. Let me start by thinking about how these numbers can relate to each other. \n\nFirst, 121 is a square number (11 squared), so maybe there's a way to get that through multiplication or division. Alternatively, it might involve adding and subtracting. Let me check the possible combinations.\n\nLet me list out the numbers again: 110, 16, 77, 82. Let's see if adding some of them gets close. 110 + 16 = 126. That's 5 over 121. If I subtract 5, but I don't have a 5. Alternatively, 77 + 82 = 159. That's way too high. 16 +77=93, which is still low. 110-16=94. Still not. \n\nWait, maybe subtracting two numbers. Let's see: 110 - 82 = 28. Then 28 + 77 = 105. Adding 16 would be 121. Wait, that would be 110 - 82 + 77 + 16. Let me check that: 110-82 is 28, 28+77 is 105, plus 16 is 121. Oh! That works. But wait, do I have to use all the numbers? Yes, 110,16,77,82. So that uses all four numbers. Let me verify the calculation step by step:\n\n110 - 82 = 28\n\n28 + 77 = 105\n\n105 + 16 = 121\n\nYes, that adds up. So the equation would be (110 - 82) + 77 + 16 = 121. But since all operations are addition and subtraction, perhaps parentheses aren't necessary, but order matters. Alternatively, grouping them differently. Let me check if the operations are allowed. Subtraction and addition are allowed. So maybe the equation is 110 - 82 + 77 + 16. Let me compute again to confirm:\n\n110 minus 82 is 28.\n\n28 plus 77 is 105.\n\n105 plus 16 is 121. Yes, that's correct. All numbers are used once. So that's the solution. \n\nBut let me see if there's another way, just to be thorough. Maybe multiplication or division. For example, 16 and 77: 16*7.5 is 120, but 7.5 isn't a number here. Alternatively, 77 divided by something. 77 divided by 16 is about 4.8. Not helpful. 110 divided by 16 is around 6.875. Hmm. Alternatively, 82 minus 77 is 5. Then 5 times something. 5 times 24.2 is 121, but 24.2 isn't available. Maybe combining operations. Let's think: 110 - (82 - (77 / 16)). Let's compute that: 77/16 is 4.8125. 82 - 4.8125 is 77.1875. 110 - 77.1875 is 32.8125. Not 121. How about 110 + 16 = 126, then 126 - 5 = 121. How to get 5? 82 -77=5. So 110 +16 - (82 -77) = 126 -5=121. That would be 110 +16 - (82 -77) = 121. Let me check: 82-77=5. 110+16=126. 126-5=121. Yes. So that's another possible equation: 110 + 16 - (82 -77) =121. Here, all numbers are used: 110,16,82,77. Each once. So that's another valid solution. \n\nWait, which one is better? The first one was 110 -82 +77 +16 =121, which is straightforward, and the second one uses parentheses for subtraction. Either way, both are correct. But maybe the first one is simpler. Let me check if the problem requires minimal parentheses. Since the order of operations is left to right for addition and subtraction, the first equation would be evaluated as ((110 -82) +77) +16, which is the same as 28+77=105+16=121. So both equations are valid, but written differently. \n\nSo there are at least two possible equations. But the problem says to return the equation. Either would work, but perhaps the second one uses parentheses more effectively. Let me check if there's any other way with multiplication or division. For example, 77*16=1232, which is way too high. 110* something. 110*1.1 is 121, but 1.1 isn't available. Alternatively, 82 + something. 82+39=121. How to get 39? 16+77- something. 16+77=93. 93-54=39. But 54 isn't available. Alternatively, 110-71=39, but 71 isn't here. Hmm. Not helpful. \n\nAnother approach: 121 is 110 +11. How to get 11 from 16,77,82. Maybe 77 - (82-16). Let's compute: 82-16=66. 77-66=11. Then 110 +11=121. So that would be 110 + (77 - (82-16)) = 121. Which is the same as the second equation I found earlier. So that's another way to write it. \n\nSo the possible equations are:\n\n1) 110 -82 +77 +16 =121\n\n2) 110 +16 - (82 -77) =121\n\n3) 110 + (77 - (82 -16))=121\n\nAll are valid and use each number once. The problem says \"create an equation\" so any of these would work. The simplest might be the first one without parentheses, but perhaps the second one with parentheses is more explicit. Since the example uses parentheses, maybe the answer expects some grouping. Let me check the example given: <answer>(1 + 2) / 3</answer>. So they used parentheses. So perhaps the user expects grouping. Therefore, the second equation might be preferred. Let me confirm with the first equation:\n\n110 -82 +77 +16. Let's compute left to right: 110-82=28, 28+77=105, 105+16=121. So no parentheses needed. But the problem allows any use of basic operations. So either form is acceptable. But maybe the user would prefer using all the numbers in a more involved way. For example, using multiplication or division. Let me see if there's another solution using * or /.\n\nHmm. Let's think differently. Suppose we do 82 - (110 / (77 -16)). Let's compute the denominator first: 77-16=61. Then 110/61≈1.803. Then 82 -1.803≈80.197, which is not 121. Not helpful. How about 77 * (16 / (110 -82))? 110-82=28. 16/28≈0.571. 77*0.571≈44. That's no good. Alternatively, (110 -77) * (82 -16). That's 33 *66=2178. Way too big. \n\nAnother idea: 110 / (82 -77) +16. Let's see: 82-77=5. 110/5=22. 22+16=38. No. Alternatively, (77 +82) * (16 / something). 77+82=159. 16/159≈0.1. 159*0.1=15.9. Not helpful. \n\nWhat if I do (110 + 82) - (77 -16). Let's see: 110+82=192. 77-16=61. 192-61=131. Close but no. \n\nWait, 110 -16=94. Then 94 + (82-77)=94+5=99. Not enough. \n\nAlternatively, 82 + (77 - (110 /16)). 110/16≈6.875. 77 -6.875=70.125. 82+70.125=152.125. No. \n\nHmm. Maybe this path isn't fruitful. Let's return to the earlier solutions. Both equations are valid. The first one is 110 -82 +77 +16, the second is 110 +16 - (82 -77). Let me check if both use all numbers. Yes. The first uses 110,82,77,16. The second uses 110,16,82,77. Both are correct. \n\nThe problem statement says to return the equation in <answer> tags. The example uses parentheses even though they might not be strictly necessary, as in (1 + 2)/3. So maybe including parentheses is the way to go. Let me present the second equation with parentheses for clarity. So 110 +16 - (82 -77) =121. That would be written as (110 + 16) - (82 - 77) =121. Wait, if I group 110+16 first, it's 126 -5=121. Alternatively, the equation is 110 +16 - (82 -77). But according to order of operations, subtraction and addition are left associative, but parentheses would take precedence. So the equation as written is 110 +16 - (82 -77). Let me compute step by step: 82-77=5. Then 110+16=126. Then 126-5=121. So yes. So the equation is 110 +16 - (82 -77). \n\nTherefore, the answer would be <answer>110 + 16 - (82 - 77)</answer>.\n</think>\n\n<answer>110 + 16 - (82 - 77)</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using the numbers 40, 41, 5, and 179 exactly once each, along with basic arithmetic operations, to get 650. Hmm. Let me start by thinking about what operations can get me close to 650.\n\nFirst, maybe multiplication is key here because 650 is a relatively large number. Let me check if multiplying some of the larger numbers can get close. For example, 179 is the biggest number. If I multiply 179 by 5, that gives 895. Then maybe subtract or add the others. Let's try 179*5 = 895. Then 895 - 41 = 854, which is still more than 650. Maybe subtract 40 too? 854 - 40 = 814. Still too high. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe combine 40 and 5 first. 40*5=200. Then 200 + 41=241. Then 241 + 179=420. No, that's too low.\n\nWait, what if I do 179 + 41 = 220. Then 220 * something. If I multiply 220 by 3, that's 660, which is close to 650. But I don't have a 3. Wait, but maybe I can create 3 using 40 and 5. 40 divided by 5 is 8. Hmm, not helpful. Or 5 - (40/ something). Wait, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 179*40 = 7160. That's way too big. Maybe 179*3.5? But I don't have those numbers. Let's see, 179 multiplied by what would get close to 650. 179*3=537, 179*4=716. So 716 is close to 650 but over. If I could subtract something from 716. Like 716 - 66 = 650. How to get 66 from 41 and 5. 41+5=46. Not enough. 41*1.6=65.6. But we can't use fractions. Hmm. Wait, maybe 41 + (5*5)=41+25=66. But we already used 5 once. Oh right, each number can be used only once.\n\nSo scratch that. Let's think again.\n\nWhat if I take 40 and 5 to make 45. Then 45*14.44=650. But 14.44 is not possible with the remaining numbers. Wait, 179 - 41 = 138. Then 138 * 5 = 690. 690 - 40 = 650. Oh! Wait, let's check that. 179 - 41 is 138. Then 138 multiplied by 5 is 690. Then subtract 40. So 138*5=690, 690-40=650. But the numbers used would be 179,41,5,40. Yes! All used once. Let me verify: 179 - 41 = 138. 138 *5 =690. 690 -40=650. Yes! That uses all numbers once. So the equation would be (179 - 41) * 5 -40 = 650. Let me check the arithmetic again to be sure. 179-41=138. 138*5=690. 690-40=650. Yep, that works!\n</think>\n\n<answer>((179 - 41) * 5) - 40 = 650</answer>"}]}

Let me start by thinking about what operations could lead me close to 385.\n\nFirst, 385 is a relatively large number. Let me see the numbers I have: 18, 7, 356, 40. The largest number here is 356. If I can add or multiply that with something else to reach near 385. Let's see: 356 + 40 = 396. That's 11 over 385. Hmm, maybe subtract something. 356 + 40 - 18 +7? Let me check: 356+40=396, 396-18=378, 378+7=385. Wait, that actually works! But wait, did I use all the numbers? Let's see: 356, 40, 18, 7. Yes, all four. But wait, the operations would be addition, subtraction, and addition again. So the equation would be 356 + 40 - 18 + 7 = 385. Let me verify:\n\n356 + 40 = 396\n\n396 - 18 = 378\n\n378 +7 = 385. Yes, that's correct. But do I have to use each number only once and all of them? Yes, each number is used once. So that would be (356 + 40) - 18 + 7. But parentheses aren't necessary here because addition and subtraction are left associative. Alternatively, I could write it as 356 + 40 - 18 +7. That works. Wait, but maybe the problem expects me to use all four numbers in a way that combines operations more intricately? Let me check again. The problem says \"using all the numbers\" once, and operations can be used multiple times. So in this case, each number is used once, and the operations are +, -, +. So the equation is valid. Let me check if that's acceptable. The problem didn't specify that I have to use each operation, just that I can use them one or multiple times. So even if I use + twice and - once, that's okay. So this seems like a valid solution. Let me see if there's another way, perhaps with multiplication or division. For example, 356 is close to 385. Maybe 356 plus something. 356 + (7*40) = 356 + 280 = 636, which is too big. 356 + 18*7 = 356 +126=482, still not. 356 + (40 - 18) *7? Let's see: 40-18=22, 22*7=154, 356+154=510. No. Alternatively, 356 + (40/7)*18. Wait, 40 divided by 7 is approximately 5.714, times 18 is around 102.857, plus 356 would be 458.857. Not helpful. How about 18*7=126. 126 +356=482. Then 482 -40=442. Not close. Alternatively, 40*7=280. 356 +280=636. Then 636 -18=618. Still not. Hmm. Another approach: 356 + (40 -7) = 356 +33=389. Close to 385. Then 389 -18=371. No. Not enough. Alternatively, 356 - 7=349. 349 +40=389. Then 389 -18=371. Still not. What if I do 40*18=720. Then 720 - 356=364. 364 +7=371. Not helpful. Maybe 356/7 is approximately 50.857. Multiply by 18? That's way too big. 356*7=2492. Definitely too big. Let me think again. The first solution I found seems to work. 356 +40=396, minus 18 gives 378, plus 7 gives 385. So that uses all numbers once. The equation would be 356 + 40 - 18 +7 =385. But let me check if that's allowed. Since all numbers are used once, and operations are used as needed. Yes. So maybe that's the answer. Let me check once more: 356 +40 =396, 396-18=378, 378+7=385. Correct. So the equation is 356 + 40 - 18 + 7 = 385. But the problem might require parentheses? Like (356 +40) - (18 -7). Wait, that would be 396 -11=385. Oh, that's another way to write it. Let me calculate: 356 +40 =396, 18-7=11, 396-11=385. So that's another possible equation: (356 +40) - (18 -7) =385. But here, all numbers are used once, operations are +, -, and -, but each number is used once. So that's a valid equation. Which one is better? The first one uses the numbers in sequence, but requires three operations (+, -, +). The second uses two operations with parentheses. But both are correct. The problem allows any use of operations as long as numbers are used once. The second version might be more efficient. Let me check: (356 +40) is 396, and (18-7) is 11, 396-11=385. Correct. So that uses all numbers and operations. So that equation would be (356 +40) - (18 -7) =385. This way, each number is used once, and all four numbers are included. So that's another valid answer. Which one should I choose? The problem didn't specify whether parentheses are allowed. The example given was (1 +2)/3, so parentheses are acceptable. So the second version with parentheses might be better. Let me verify again. 356+40=396, 18-7=11, 396-11=385. Correct. So that's a valid equation. So the answer could be either 356 +40 -18 +7 or (356 +40) - (18 -7). Both are correct. Let me see which one uses the numbers once. In the first case, it's written as 356 +40 -18 +7. But here, it's using each number once. The second uses them in two grouped operations. I think either is acceptable. But maybe the second one is more concise. So perhaps that's better. Let me make sure. The problem says \"create an equation that equals 385. You can use basic arithmetic operations... each number can only be used once, and you must use all the numbers.\" So as long as all numbers are used once, the equation is correct. Both options meet that. But maybe the second one is more efficient. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects to use multiplication or division. Let me check if that's possible. For example, 7*40=280. 356 -280=76. 76 +18=94. No. Not helpful. Alternatively, 356 - (40*7)=356-280=76. 76 +18=94. No. 356/7 is approximately 50.857. 50.857 +40=90.857. 90.857*18=1635.428. Not 385. Hmm. How about 18*40=720. 720 -356=364. 364 +7=371. No. Not enough. What about 18*7=126. 126 +356=482. 482 -40=442. No. 442 is higher than 385. Alternatively, 356 - (40 +18)=356-58=298. 298*7=2086. No. Not helpful. Another way: 356 - (40/7) ≈356 -5.714≈350.286. 350.286 +18≈368.286. Not 385. Not helpful. Alternatively, (356 -18) =338. 338 * (7/40). Wait, that would be 338 *0.175=59.15. No. Not useful. Hmm. Maybe there's another way, but the first solution I found seems to be the straightforward one. Let me confirm once again. The equation (356 +40) - (18 -7) = 385. That's 396 -11=385. Correct. All numbers used once. So that's a valid equation. Alternatively, writing it without parentheses: 356 +40 -18 +7=385. Also correct. Since the problem allows using operations multiple times, either form is acceptable. The example given uses parentheses, so maybe the answer expects parentheses. But perhaps both are acceptable. Let me check the arithmetic again. 356 +40=396. 18-7=11. 396-11=385. Correct. So (356 +40) - (18 -7) is 385. That's correct. Alternatively, 356 +40=396, then subtract 18 gives 378, then add 7 gives 385. So both ways. The problem might prefer using all operations, but in this case, subtraction and addition. However, the problem doesn't require using all operations. So either equation is correct. But maybe the one with subtraction of a parentheses is better. Let's go with that.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(356 + 40) - (18 - 7) = 385</answer>"}]}

Let me start by thinking about how these numbers can combine. \n\nFirst, 306 is the largest number here. Maybe if I subtract something from 306 to get close to 338. Let's check: 306 minus something. 306 - 75 = 231, which is too low. 306 - 39 = 267, still too low. 306 - 4 = 302. Not helpful. Alternatively, maybe adding 306 and some of the other numbers. 306 + 39 = 345, that's over. 306 + 75 = 381, way over. 306 + 4 = 310, still not 338. \n\nAlternatively, maybe multiplying some numbers. Let's see. 75 * 4 = 300. Then 300 + 39 = 339, which is just one more than 338. Close, but not quite. Wait, but 75*4 is 300. Then 306 - 300 = 6. Hmm, but we need to use all numbers. Let me think again.\n\nWhat if I use 306 - 75 = 231. Then maybe 231 plus something. Let's see, 39 + 4 = 43. 231 + 43 is 274. Not 338. Hmm. \n\nWait, maybe 306 divided by something. 306 divided by 4 is 76.5. Then 76.5 * something. But maybe that's complicated. Let's see, 306 divided by 75 is about 4.08. Not helpful. \n\nAnother approach: 75 * 4 is 300. Then 306 - 300 is 6. Then 6 + 39 = 45. Not 338. Doesn't use all numbers. Wait, but we need to use all of them. So maybe combine operations in a different way. Let's think.\n\nHow about 75 - 4 = 71. Then 71 * 4? Wait, but 4 is already used. No, each number can be used once. So maybe 75 - 4 = 71, then 71 * 5? But 5 isn't in the numbers. Hmm. Not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps 39 * 4 = 156. Then 75 + 156 = 231. Then 306 + 231 = 537. Too big. No. \n\nAlternatively, 39 * 8 is 312, but where would 8 come from? 75 - (306 / 4) ? Let's calculate 306 divided by 4 is 76.5. Then 75 - 76.5 is -1.5. Then 39 * (-1.5) is -58.5. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe combine 306 and 75 first. 306 - 75 = 231. Then 231 + 39 = 270. 270 +4=274. Still not. \n\nWait, maybe using division. Let's see. 306 divided by something. For example, 306 / 75 = 4.08. Then 4.08 * 39 is about 159.12. Then subtract 4? 159.12 -4 = 155.12. Not close. \n\nWhat if I do 75 * (4 + something). Let's see, 4 + 39 = 43. 75 *43 = 3225. That's way too big. \n\nAlternatively, 39 + 75 = 114. 114 * 3 = 342. But 3 isn't here. But 306 is 3*102. Hmm. Maybe 39 +75 =114. Then 306 - 114 =192. Then 192 +4=196. No. \n\nWait, perhaps 306 - (75 - 4) = 306 -71 =235. Then 235 +39=274. Still not. \n\nHmm. Maybe multiplication and subtraction. Let's see: 39 * 4 = 156. Then 156 + 75 =231. Then 306 +231=537. No. \n\nWait, maybe 75 * (4) = 300. Then 306 - 300 =6. Then 39 -6=33. Not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, 75 * 4.5 = 337.5, but 4.5 would need division. Let's see: 306 divided by 75 is 4.08, which is not 4.5. \n\nWait, maybe 75 * (4 + (306 / 39))? Let's see. 306 divided by 39 is 7.846. Then 4 +7.846=11.846. 75 *11.846≈888.46. Way too big. \n\nAlternatively, 306 - (75 / (4 + something)). Let's see, 4 +39=43. 75 /43 ≈1.744. 306 -1.744≈304.256. Not helpful. \n\nHmm. Maybe using subtraction and addition. Let's try 306 + 75 =381. Then subtract something. 381 -39=342. Then 342 -4=338. Wait, that works! Let me check:\n\n306 +75 =381.\n\n381 -39 =342.\n\n342 -4=338.\n\nBut wait, we have to use all numbers once. So the equation would be 306 +75 -39 -4=338. But does that use each number once? Yes: 306,75,39,4. Each used once. All operations are + and -. That should be acceptable. Let me verify:\n\n306 +75 = 381.\n\n381 -39 = 342.\n\n342 -4=338. Yes, correct. So the equation is 306 +75 -39 -4 =338. But the problem says to create an equation using all numbers once with operations. So this works. Let me check if this is allowed. Each number is used once, and all are used. Operations are applied as needed. So yes, this is a valid equation.\n</think>\n\n<answer>306 + 75 - 39 - 4 = 338</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using the numbers 20, 13, 25, and 46, each exactly once, with basic operations to get 64. Hmm. Let me start by thinking about how these numbers can combine. \n\nFirst, maybe I should look for pairs that can make numbers close to 64. Let's see. 46 is the largest number here, so maybe I can use that as a base. If I subtract something from 46, what would that be? 46 - (something) = 64? Wait, that would need the something to be negative, which might not be possible here. Alternatively, adding 46 to another number. But 46 + 20 is 66, which is close. Then 66 minus something... 13 and 25. 66 - 13 is 53, 66 -25 is 41. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe multiplication? Let's see. 25 * 2.5 is 62.5, but I don't have 2.5. Alternatively, 46 divided by something. 46 divided by 0.71875 would be 64, but that's not helpful here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe combining 25 and 13 first. 25 +13=38. Then 46 - 38=8. Then 20 +8=28. No. Not helpful. Hmm. Let's try different combinations.\n\nAnother approach: target 64. Let's think what operations can get there. 64 is 8*8, 16*4, 32*2, etc. But how to get those numbers from the given ones. Alternatively, 64 could be 60 +4, 70-6, etc. Let's see.\n\nWhat if I use 46 and 20. 46 +20=66. Then subtract 2 would be 64. But where do I get 2 from? The remaining numbers are 13 and25. 25-13=12. Not 2. Alternatively, 13 - (25/ something). Wait, maybe 25 divided by something. But 25/13 is about 1.92, which is close to 2. If I do 46 +20 - (25/13) = 66 -1.92 ≈ 64.08. Close but not exact. But we need exact. So that might not work.\n\nAlternatively, 25 * 2.56 is 64. But getting 2.56 from 20,13,46? Not sure. Maybe another approach.\n\nLet me think of using multiplication. For example, 13*5=65, which is close. How can I get 5? 25 divided by 5. Wait, but 25 is one of the numbers. Wait, 20 divided by 4 is 5. But do I have a 4? Not directly. Hmm.\n\nWait, let's try using all numbers. Suppose 46 - 25 =21. Then 21 +13=34. 34 *20=680. No, that's way too big. Not helpful.\n\nAnother idea: 25 -13=12. Then 46 -12=34. 34 +20=54. Not 64. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe combining 20 and 25. 20 +25=45. Then 45 +13=58. 58 +46=104. No. Alternatively, 20 *25=500. That's way too big. Maybe division. 25/20=1.25. Then 46 -1.25=44.75. 44.75 +13=57.75. Not helpful.\n\nHow about 46 - (something). Let's see. 46 - (25 +13) = 8. Then 8 *20=160. No. Not 64. Alternatively, 46 -25=21. 21 * (20 -13) =21*7=147. Still no.\n\nWait, 46 +13=59. 59 +5=64. Where to get 5 from 20 and25? 25-20=5. Oh! Wait, that's a possibility. Let's check:\n\n46 +13 + (25 -20) =46+13=59, then 25-20=5, so 59+5=64. But does that use all numbers? Let's see: 46,13,25,20. Yes, each is used once. And operations: +, +, -. But the way to write this would be 46 +13 + (25 -20) =64. But I need to check the order. Wait, 25-20 is 5, then 46+13=59, plus 5=64. So yes. But the equation would be 46 + 13 +25 -20 =64. Wait, but 46+13 is 59, then +25 is 84, minus 20 is 64. Wait, that's different. Wait, hold on:\n\nIf I do 46 +13 +25 -20, that's 46+13=59, +25=84, -20=64. Oh! So that works. Let's check:\n\n46 +13=59; 59+25=84; 84-20=64. Yes. So the equation is 46 +13 +25 -20 =64. All numbers used once. Operations are all + and -, so that's allowed. Let me verify: 46,13,25,20 each used once. Yes. 46+13+25-20 = (46+13)+(25-20)=59+5=64. Alternatively, as written step by step. Either way, the total is 64. So that works.\n</think>\n\n<answer>46 + 13 + 25 - 20 = 64</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using the numbers 96, 54, 9, and 7, each exactly once, and the result should be 569. The operations allowed are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Hmm, this seems a bit tricky. Let me start by thinking about the target number, 569. It's a bit over 500, so maybe I need to combine the larger numbers first.\n\nLooking at the numbers provided: 96 is the largest, followed by 54. If I could multiply 96 by something close to 6, that would get me to around 576, which is just 7 more than 569. Wait, 96 multiplied by 6 is 576. But how do I get 6 from the remaining numbers? The remaining numbers are 54, 9, and 7. Wait, no, wait—if I use 96 and 54, then the remaining numbers would be 9 and 7. Wait, but I have to use all four numbers. So I can't just use 96 and 54; I need to use all four. So perhaps I need to structure it in a way that combines them all.\n\nLet me try different combinations. Let's see: 96 multiplied by something. If I take 54 divided by 9, that gives me 6. Then 96 times 6 is 576. Then subtract 7 to get 569. That would use all numbers: 96, 54, 9 (since 54/9 is 6), and then subtract 7. So the equation would be 96 * (54 / 9) - 7. Let me check that. 54 divided by 9 is 6. 96 times 6 is 576. 576 minus 7 is 569. Yes! That works. Wait, but does that use all the numbers? Let me see: 96 is used, 54 is used, 9 is used in the division, and 7 is subtracted. Yes, all four numbers are used once each. That seems to fit the requirements. Let me just verify the arithmetic again to make sure. 54 ÷ 9 = 6. 96 × 6 = 576. 576 - 7 = 569. Correct. So the equation would be 96*(54/9) - 7.

I need to use all the numbers 5, 97, 43, and 17 exactly once each with basic operations to make 743. Hmm. Let me start by thinking about what operations might get me close. \n\nFirst, 743 is a relatively large number. Since 97 is the largest number here, maybe multiplying it by something would get close. Let's check: 97 * 7 is 679, which is under 743. 97*8 is 776, which is over. So maybe 97*7.5 or something? But we can only use integers and the given numbers. Alternatively, perhaps adding or subtracting other numbers after multiplying 97 by something.\n\nWait, 97*7 is 679. Then 743 - 679 is 64. But do I have numbers left that can make 64? The remaining numbers are 5, 43, and 17. Hmm. 43 + 17 is 60, plus 5 is 65. Close but not 64. Alternatively, 43 + 17 is 60, then 5* something. 5*12.8 is 64, but that's not helpful. Maybe not the right path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 97* something else. Let's see, 97*43 is 4171, which is way too big. That's way over. So maybe division? If I use division, but dividing 97 by something? 97/5 is 19.4, which isn't helpful. 97 divided by 17 is around 5.7. Not sure. Maybe 43 - 17 is 26, then 26 * something. Wait, 43-17=26, 26*5=130. Then 97* something plus that. 97*7=679, 679+130=809, which is over. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe subtract instead. 97*8 is 776. If I can get 776 and then subtract 33, that's 743. But how to get 33 from 5, 43, 17. Let's see: 43 - (17-5) = 43-12=31, not 33. 17*2=34, but I don't have another 17. Hmm. 5*6.6=33, but that's not possible. Maybe 5+17=22, 43-22=21. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 43*17. Let's calculate that: 43*17=731. Then 731 + something =743. That would need 12. The remaining numbers are 5 and 97. But 97-5=92. 731 +92=823. Not helpful. Or 97/5=19.4. Not helpful. Alternatively, 43*17=731, then 743-731=12. So maybe 97 - 5* something equals 12. 97 -5x=12. 5x=85. x=17. But 17 is already used. So can't do that.\n\nAnother approach: let's look at 743 and see if it can be broken down into factors. 743 is a prime number, I think. So factoring might not help. Alternatively, maybe 743 divided by something. Not sure.\n\nWhat if we use subtraction? Let's see: 97*5 is 485. Then maybe 43*17=731. 731 -485=246. Not helpful. Alternatively, 97*5=485. 743-485=258. Can I get 258 from 43 and 17? 43*6=258, but we don't have 6. 17*15=255, close. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe 17*43 = 731. Then 731 + 5 =736. Still under. Then 736 +97=833. No, that's way over. But maybe a different combination. 97 +43=140. 140*5=700. 700 +17=717. Still under. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, 97* (43 -17). Let's compute 43-17=26. 97*26=2522. That's way too big. Then divide by 5? 2522/5=504.4. Not helpful.\n\nWait, 97 +43=140. Then 140*5=700. Then 700 +17=717. Still 26 away. Not enough. Hmm. Alternatively, 140*5=700, and then 17* something. 17*2=34. 700+34=734. Still 9 short. Not helpful.\n\nWhat if we do 97*5=485, then 43*17=731. Then 731 + (something). Wait, 731 + (97-5)=731 +92=823. No. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe 97*(5 + something). Let's see. 5 + 17=22. 97*22=2134. Way too big. Then subtract 43? 2134-43=2091. Not helpful. Alternatively, 5 +43=48. 97*48=4656. No. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, 97-43=54. 54*17=918. Then subtract 5* something. 918 -5=913. No. 918-5*17=918-85=833. Still not 743.\n\nWait, let's think again. 743. Maybe 17*43 is 731. Then 731 + (97-5). Let's compute 97-5=92. 731 +92=823. No. Alternatively, 731 + (5* something). 5*12=60. 731+60=791. Still over.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 97*7=679. Then 679 + 43=722. Then 722 +17=739. Still 4 short. Hmm.\n\nWait, 97*7=679. Then 43*17=731. 731 + (something). Wait, 731 is already higher than 743. How about 731 + something else. Wait, 97*7 is 679. 731 is 43*17. Then 731 - (97/5). But division might not get us an integer. 97 divided by 5 is 19.4. 731 -19.4=711.6. Not helpful.\n\nHmm. Maybe using subtraction. Let's see: 97*43=4171. That's way too big. But 4171 - something. If we use 17 and 5. 4171 - (17*5)=4171-85=4086. Still way too big. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 43*17=731. 731 +97=828. Then subtract 85 (which is 5*17). 828 -85=743. Wait, let me check that. 43*17 is 731. 731 +97=828. Then subtract 5*17=85. 828 -85=743. But wait, here's the problem: I would have used 17 twice. Because in 43*17, we used 17, then again in 5*17. But 17 can only be used once. So that's not allowed. So that approach doesn't work because we reused 17.\n\nHmm, so that's a problem. Let me see: 43*17 +97 -5*17. That would be 17*(43 -5) +97. But that's 17*38 +97. 17*38=646. 646+97=743. Wait a minute! Wait, 17*(43 -5) +97. Let's compute that: 43-5=38. 38*17=646. 646+97=743. But let's check the numbers used: 17 is used once in (43-5)*17. Then 97 is added. So numbers used are 17,43,5,97. All four numbers once each. That works! So the equation would be (43 -5) *17 +97 =743. Let me verify:\n\n43-5=38. 38*17=646. 646+97=743. Yes! That works. So the equation is (43 -5) *17 +97 =743. Let me check if all numbers are used once: 43,5,17,97. Yes. All used once. Perfect. So that's the solution.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(43 - 5) * 17 + 97 = 743</answer>"}]}

If I can multiply 50 by something to get close to 690. 50 times 13.8 is 690, but I need integers. Wait, 50 times 13.8 equals 690. Hmm, but I need to make 13.8 from the remaining numbers 9, 23, and 15. That might be tricky. Alternatively, maybe 50 multiplied by 23? 50*23 is 1150, which is way over. So that's too much.\n\nWhat if I combine 50 and 15 first? 50*15 is 750. Then subtract something. 750 minus what equals 690? 750 - 60 = 690. So can I make 60 from 9 and 23? 23 - 9 is 14, which isn't 60. 23 + 9 is 32. 23*9 is 207, which is way too big. 23/9 is about 2.55. Not helpful. So that approach might not work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 50 multiplied by something else. Let's think: 690 divided by 50 is 13.8. So maybe 23 minus something? Let's see: 23 - 9 is 14, then 14 times 15? Wait, 14*15 is 210, which is not 13.8. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe 15 divided by something. 15 divided by (something) to get 13.8. Not sure.\n\nWait, another idea: 15 multiplied by 50 is 750. Then, 750 minus (23 + 9) is 750 - 32 = 718. Not 690. Hmm. How about 23 times something. Let's see: 23 times 30 is 690. Wait, 23*30=690. But how to get 30 from the remaining numbers 9, 15, 50. Let's see. 15*2 is 30, but I need to use 9 and 50. 50 - (9 + 15) = 50 -24=26. Not helpful. Alternatively, 50 - (15 + 9) = 26 again. Hmm.\n\nWait, if I need 30, maybe 15*2, but I don't have a 2. Or 9 + 15 + (50/ something). Hmm. Alternatively, (50 / (something)) to get a number that when multiplied by 23 gives 690. Let's think: 690 divided by 23 is 30. So if I can get 30 from 9, 15, and 50. Let's see. 50 - (15 +9) =26, as before. Not 30. How about 15* (50/25) =30, but I don't have 25. Alternatively, 50 - 20=30. How to make 20 from 9 and 15? 15 +5=20, but where's the 5? Maybe 9 - (15 / something). Not sure. \n\nWait, maybe (50 - (15 -9))? 15-9=6, so 50-6=44. Not 30. Alternatively, 15 + (50/ something). 50 divided by 5 is 10, but how to get 5 from 9? 9-4=5, but no 4. Not helpful.\n\nAnother angle: Let's try combining 23 and 15. 23*15=345. Then 345*2=690. So if I can get 2 from the remaining numbers 9 and 50. 50 divided by 25=2, but I don't have 25. 9 -7=2, but no 7. Hmm. Alternatively, 50/ (something). 50 divided by 9 is about 5.55. Not 2. 50-48=2. How to get 48 from 9. 9*5.333, but that's not helpful. \n\nWait, maybe 50 - (9* something). 9*5=45, so 50-45=5. Not 2. Hmm. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 23 + 15 =38. Then 38 * something. 690 /38 is approximately 18.15. Not sure. Let's see 38*18=684, close to 690. Not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps (23 + 9) * (15 + something). 23+9=32. 32*21.5625=690. But 21.5625 isn't easy to get from 15 and 50. Maybe not.\n\nAnother approach: 50*15=750. Then 750 - (23* something). Let's see 750 -23x=690. So 23x=60. x=60/23≈2.608. Not an integer, but maybe fractions are allowed? Wait, the problem says basic arithmetic operations. So fractions are allowed. So 60 divided by 23 is 60/23. But how to get 60 from 9 and something. Wait, no, 23 is already used. Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nIf I have 50*15 - (23 * x) =690. Then 750 -23x=690 → 23x=60 → x=60/23. So x would need to be 60/23. But how to get 60/23 from 9 and the remaining numbers. Wait, but the remaining number is 9. Wait, but I've already used 50,15,23. The remaining number is 9. So I have to use 9. So maybe 50*15 -23*(something with 9)=690. But 23*(something)=60. So (something)=60/23. How to get 60/23 using 9. That seems impossible. Maybe that's not the way.\n\nAnother idea: 50* (23 - (15/9)). Let's compute that: 15/9 is 1.666..., 23-1.666≈21.333. 50*21.333≈1066.65. Not 690.\n\nHmm. Maybe (23 -15) * (50 +9). 23-15=8, 50+9=59. 8*59=472. Not 690.\n\nAlternatively, 23*(15 + (50/9)). Let's calculate 50/9≈5.555, 15+5.555≈20.555. 23*20.555≈473. Not enough.\n\nWait, 9* (50 + something) =690. 9*76.666=690. So 50 + x=76.666. x=26.666. So 26.666 from 23 and 15. 23 +15=38, which is more. 23*15=345, which is way over. Maybe 15 + (23/ something). 23/2=11.5, so 15+11.5=26.5. Close to 26.666. So 9*(50 +15 + (23/2))=9*(65 +11.5)=9*76.5=688.5, which is close but not exact. But we can't use 23 divided by 2 because we don't have a 2. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (50*15) - (23*9). Let's compute: 750 - 207=543. Not 690.\n\nWhat about (50*23) - (15*9)=1150-135=1015. No.\n\nWait, 23* (50 - (15-9)). Let's compute 15-9=6, 50-6=44. 23*44=1012. No.\n\nHmm. Maybe combining operations in a different way. Let's try to think of 690 as a product. 690 factors into 2*3*5*23. Let's see. So if I can get 2,3,5 from the numbers. Wait, the numbers are 9,23,15,50. 15 is 3*5, 50 is 2*5^2, 9 is 3^2. So maybe 23*15* (50/ (something)). Let's see: 23*15=345. Then 345*2=690. So 50 divided by 25=2. But how to get 25? Or 50 divided by 25=2. But 25 would be 50/2, but that's using 50 again. Wait, perhaps 50/(15- (9))=50/6≈8.333. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe 50/ (15/9) =50*(9/15)=50*(3/5)=30. Then 23*30=690. Oh! That's possible. Let's check:\n\n23 * (50 * (9 /15)) =23*(50*(3/5))=23*(30)=690. Yes! Let's verify the numbers used: 23,50,9,15. All used once. And the operations: division and multiplication. So the equation would be 23 * (50 * (9 /15)) =690. Let me write that with parentheses properly: 23 * (50 * (9 /15)) → but maybe simplify the parentheses. Alternatively, 23 * 50 * 9 /15. Let's check that calculation:\n\n50 *9 =450, 450 /15=30, 30*23=690. Yes. So the equation is (23 * 50 * 9) /15 =690. Or maybe 23 * (50 * (9 /15)) =690. Either way, all numbers are used once. Let me check if that's allowed. The division is part of the operations, and each number is used once. So yes.\n\nSo the equation is 23 * 50 * 9 /15 =690. Let me compute step by step:\n\nFirst, 9 divided by15 is 0.6. Then 50 multiplied by 0.6 is 30. Then 23 multiplied by30 is 690. Correct. So the equation can be written as (23 * 50 * 9) /15 =690, but perhaps with parentheses to make the order clearer. Alternatively, 23 * (50 * (9 /15)) =690. Either way, all numbers are used once, and the operations are valid.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(23 * 50 * 9) / 15 = 690</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using all the numbers 73, 47, 713, and 86 exactly once, with basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) to get 919. Hmm, this might be a bit tricky. Let me start by thinking about the target number, 919. It's a relatively large number, so maybe multiplication will be involved. But I need to use all four numbers, so perhaps combining them in some way.\n\nFirst, let me list the numbers again: 73, 47, 713, 86. Let me consider the larger numbers first, like 713 and 86. If I can combine those in a way that gets close to 919, maybe the smaller numbers can adjust it. For instance, 713 plus 86 is 799. That's still less than 919 by 120. But then I have 73 and 47 left. How can I use those? Maybe multiply them? 73 times 47 is 3431, which is way too big. If I subtract that from something, that would overshoot. Alternatively, maybe subtract 47 from 73 to get 26, then add that to 799: 799 + 26 = 825, which is still not enough. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe multiply 713 by a number. Let's see, 713 times 1.3 is around 926.9, which is close to 919, but how can I get 1.3 using the other numbers? Let's see, 86 divided by 73 is approximately 1.178, and 47 divided by 36 is around 1.305. Wait, but I can't use 36. Alternatively, maybe 86 divided by (73 - 47). Let's calculate 73 - 47 = 26. Then 86 / 26 ≈ 3.307. Then 713 * 3.307 is way over. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe use division differently. For example, 713 divided by something. 713 / 47 is approximately 15.17. Then 15.17 + 86 + 73 would be 15.17 + 86 = 101.17 +73=174.17, which is way too low. Not helpful.\n\nHow about subtracting 713 from something? Let's see, 86 * 47 = 4042. Then 4042 - 713 = 3329. Then 3329 + 73 = 3402. That's way over. Maybe not the right path.\n\nWait, maybe use subtraction and addition. Let's think: 919 is the target. Let's see if we can break it down. 919 can be expressed as 713 + 206. Then 206. How to get 206 from 86, 73, 47. Let's see, 86 * 2.4 is around 206.4. But how to get 2.4 from 73 and 47? 73 - 47 = 26. 73/47 ≈ 1.553. Hmm, not helpful. Alternatively, 86 + 73 = 159, then 159 +47=206. Wait, 86 +73 +47=206. But then 713 + 86 +73 +47 = 919. But wait, that uses all the numbers, but the operations are just addition. But the problem states that you have to use all the numbers once with basic operations. So maybe that's possible? Let me check: 713 + 86 + 73 +47 = 713+86=799, 799+73=872, 872+47=919. Oh, wait! That's actually correct. But is that allowed? The problem says you can use the operations one or multiple times. If I just add all of them together, that's using the + operation three times. Each number is used once. So maybe the equation is simply 713 + 86 + 73 + 47 = 919. Let me verify: 713 +86 is 799. Then 799 +73 is 872. Then 872 +47 is 919. Yes. That works. But wait, the problem says \"create an equation that equals 919\" using all the numbers with each used once. Since addition is allowed, and I used all numbers once, and the operations are all +, that should be acceptable. But maybe the problem expects some combination of operations, but according to the instructions, if adding them all works, then that's a valid answer. Let me check the problem statement again: \"using basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) one or multiple times but each number can only be used once, and you must use all the numbers.\" So adding all of them is acceptable. But wait, the user provided an example with parentheses, so maybe they are expecting a more complex equation. Let me check: the example is (1 + 2) / 3, which uses three numbers. In this problem, four numbers. But if adding all four numbers gives 919, then that's a valid equation. Let me confirm the sum: 713 + 86 = 799, 799 +73=872, 872 +47=919. Yes. So the equation is 713 + 86 + 73 + 47 = 919. However, let me check if that's correct. Maybe I made a miscalculation. Let me add them step by step: 713 + 47 = 760. Then 86 +73=159. 760 +159=919. Yes. So indeed, the sum of all four numbers is 919. Therefore, the equation is simply 713 + 47 + 86 + 73 = 919. But since order doesn't matter in addition, any order is acceptable. So the answer could be written as (713 + 47) + (86 + 73) = 919, but maybe the simplest way is 713 + 86 + 73 + 47. However, the problem might have wanted a more complex equation, but according to the rules, this is valid. Let me check if I didn't misread the numbers. The numbers given are 73, 47, 713, 86. Yes. So summing them all gives 919. So that's the equation. Therefore, the answer is 713 + 86 + 73 + 47 = 919, so the equation is (713 + 86) + (73 + 47) or just 713 + 47 + 86 + 73. Since the order doesn't matter, but perhaps to make it clear, group them in pairs. But the exact format can vary as long as all numbers are used once with + operations. So the final equation is simply the sum of all four numbers. Therefore, the answer is <answer>713 + 86 + 73 + 47</answer>.\n</think>\n\n<answer>713 + 86 + 73 + 47</answer>"}]}

I need to use all the numbers 56, 42, 10, and 16 exactly once each with basic arithmetic operations to make 40. Hmm. Let me start by thinking about the target number, 40. It's a multiple of 10, so maybe 10 can be part of the solution directly. Let's see.\n\nFirst, 10 is one of the numbers. If I can somehow get 40 using 10 multiplied by something, but 10 is already there. Wait, 40 divided by 10 is 4. Maybe if I can get 4 from the other numbers and then multiply by 10. Let's check: 56, 42, 16. How can I get 4 from these? Let's see. 56 minus 42 is 14. Then 16 divided by something. Wait, 14 plus 16 is 30. Not helpful. Or 56 divided by 16 is 3.5, but that's a fraction. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, 42 divided by 16 is 2.625, which isn't useful. Maybe subtract: 56 - 42 = 14. Then 14 + 16 = 30. Then 30 * something with 10. But 30*10 is 300, which is way over. Wait, maybe 56 - (42 - 16) = 56 - 26 = 30. Then 30 + 10 = 40. But that uses all numbers except 42? Wait no, wait. Let me check. If I do 56 - (42 -16) = 56 -26=30. Then 30 +10=40. But that would use 56,42,16,10. All four numbers. Wait, but the operations: 56 minus (42 minus16) plus 10. Let's compute that: 42-16=26, 56-26=30, 30+10=40. So that's (56 - (42 -16)) +10. Wait, but that uses all numbers once. Let me verify:\n\nNumbers used: 56,42,16,10. Each once. Operations: subtraction inside the parentheses, then another subtraction and addition. So the equation would be ((56 - (42 -16)) +10) = 40. Wait, but adding 10 at the end gives 30 +10=40. But wait, that's using all numbers. Let me check the calculation again. 42-16=26. Then 56-26=30. Then 30+10=40. Yes. So that's 56 - (42 -16) +10 =40. But written properly with parentheses: (56 - (42 - 16)) + 10. Let me compute that again: 42-16=26; 56-26=30; 30+10=40. Yes. So that works. But does the order of operations allow this? Let's see. The expression (56 - (42 -16)) is 30, then adding 10 gives 40. So yes. That would be the equation: (56 - (42 -16)) +10 =40. So that uses all numbers once. Let me write that down.\n\nWait, but let me check another possibility in case I made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe 56 divided by something. For example, 56 divided by (16 -10) =56/6≈9.333, which isn't helpful. Or 42 divided by something. 42/(56-16)=42/40=1.05. Then 1.05 *10=10.5. Not 40.\n\nAnother approach: 10 and 16 can be combined. 16-10=6. Then maybe 42 - (56/ (16-10)) =42 - (56/6)=42-9.333≈32.666. Not helpful. Hmm.\n\nWhat if I multiply two numbers? For example, 56*42 is way too big. 56-42=14. 14* something. 14*(16-10)=14*6=84. Not 40.\n\nAlternatively, 56 +42=98. 98 - 16=82. 82-10=72. No. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe using division. Let's think of 40 as 80/2. So 80 divided by 2. How to get 80 from the numbers. 56 + 42=98. No. 56 +16=72. Hmm. 42+16=58. 56* something? 56*(10 - (42/16))? Let's see, 42/16=2.625. 10-2.625=7.375. 56*7.375=413. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe (56 -16) * (42 -10). (40)*(32)=1280. Way too big.\n\nAlternatively, 56/(42/(16-10))). Let's compute. 16-10=6. 42/6=7. 56/7=8. Not 40.\n\nHmm. Let's try another angle. Let's list possible combinations. Since 40 is the target, and we have 10 and 16, maybe combining them with subtraction or addition. 16-10=6, or 10+16=26. Let's see. 56-42=14. 14 and 6: 14+6=20. Not 40. 14*6=84. 14/6≈2.333. Not helpful. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, 56 divided by (something). 56 divided by 1.4 is 40. How to get 1.4 from 42,10,16. Hmm. 42/(16+10)=42/26≈1.615. Then 56/1.615≈34.6. Not 40.\n\nWait, another approach: 42 - 10=32. 56 -16=40. Wait, 56-16=40. Oh! Wait, that's 56 minus 16 equals 40. But then what about 42 and 10? We need to use all numbers. So that idea is only using 56 and 16, leaving out 42 and 10. So that won't work.\n\nWait, but maybe if I can use 42 and 10 in a way that subtracts to zero? For example, 42-10=32. Then 56 -16 - (42-10) =56-16=40; 40 -32=8. Not helpful. Or 56 - (16 + (42-10))=56 - (16+32)=56-48=8. No.\n\nAlternatively, 56 - (42 / (16 -10)) ). Let's compute that: 16-10=6. 42/6=7. 56-7=49. Not 40.\n\nHmm. Let's think of 40 as a combination of operations. For example, (56 -42) + (16 -10) =14 +6=20. Not enough.\n\nWait, another way: 10*(something). 10*4=40. How to get 4 from 56,42,16. Let's see: 56-42=14. 16/(56-42)=16/14≈1.142. 10*1.142≈11.42. Not 40. Alternatively, (56-16)=40, but again missing 42 and 10.\n\nWait, maybe (56 - (42 +16))/10. Let's see: 42+16=58. 56-58=-2. -2/10=-0.2. Not 40.\n\nAlternatively, (56*10)/(42-16). Compute: 56*10=560. 42-16=26. 560/26≈21.538. Not 40.\n\nHmm. What if I do 42 - (56/(16-10)) ) * something. 16-10=6. 56/6≈9.333. 42-9.333≈32.666. Multiply by 10? 32.666*10=326.66. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe use division and multiplication. Let's try (56 - 16) + (42 -10). 40 +32=72. Not 40.\n\nAlternatively, (56 +16) - (42 +10)=72-52=20. No.\n\nHmm. Let's go back to the first idea where (56 - (42 -16)) +10=40. Let me verify this again. 42-16=26. Then 56-26=30. Then 30+10=40. Yes. So the equation is (56 - (42 -16)) +10 =40. This uses all four numbers: 56,42,16,10 each once. The operations are subtraction inside the parentheses, then subtraction again, then addition. That seems to work. Let me check if there's any other possible way, but maybe this is the correct equation.\n\nAlternatively, could there be another combination? Let me think again. For example, 42 - (16 -10) =42-6=36. Then 56 -36=20. Not 40. Or 56/( (42-16)/10 ). Let's compute: 42-16=26. 26/10=2.6. 56/2.6≈21.538. No.\n\nAlternatively, (56 +42) - (16 +10)=98-26=72. Not 40.\n\nHmm. Maybe (56 -42) * (16 -10). 14*6=84. No.\n\nWait, 10*(56/(42-16)). Compute denominator:42-16=26. 56/26≈2.1538. 10*2.1538≈21.538. Not 40.\n\nAnother idea: 42 - (56/(16/10)). Let's compute 16/10=1.6. 56/1.6=35. 42-35=7. Not helpful.\n\nHmm. What if I do (56*10 -42)/16. Let's see: 56*10=560. 560-42=518. 518/16=32.375. Not 40.\n\nAlternatively, (42*10) - (56+16)=420-72=348. Nope.\n\nAnother approach: 56 - (42 - (16 -10)). Let's compute inner parentheses:16-10=6. Then 42-6=36. 56-36=20. Not 40.\n\nHmm. I think the first solution I found works: (56 - (42 -16)) +10 =40. Let me just check again step by step. 42-16=26. 56-26=30. 30+10=40. Yes. All numbers are used once, each operation is basic. So this should be the correct answer.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(56 - (42 - 16)) + 10</answer>"}]}

The operations allowed are +, -, *, /. Hmm, 900 is a pretty big number, so maybe multiplication will be key here. Let me start by considering the largest numbers first.\n\nThe largest numbers given are 87 and 53. If I multiply those two, 87 * 53, let me calculate that. 80*50 is 4000, plus 80*3=240, plus 7*50=350, and 7*3=21. Adding those up: 4000 + 240 = 4240, +350 is 4590, +21 is 4611. That's way over 900. So that's too big. Maybe divide instead? 87 divided by 53 is less than 2, which won't help. Hmm.\n\nNext, maybe 87 and 35. 87*35. Let's see: 80*35=2800, 7*35=245. So 2800+245=3045. Still way over 900. Maybe combining with another number. Let's see, if I take 87*35 and then subtract something. But 3045 minus, say, 53 and 16 would be 3045 -53=2992, -16=2976. Not helpful. Not close to 900. Maybe division here isn't useful.\n\nWhat if I look for numbers that multiply to around 900. Let's think: 900 divided by 87 is about 10.34. So if I can get 10.34 from 35 and 16 and 53, but that seems tricky. Alternatively, 900 divided by 35 is around 25.7. So maybe 25.7 times 35 is 900. But how to get 25.7 from 53, 87, and 16. Not obvious.\n\nAlternatively, maybe combine numbers to get 100 and then multiply by 9. But 100 and 9? Not sure. Wait, 16 and 35: 35 + 16 = 51. Then 53 + 87 = 140. 140 * 51 would be way over. Not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps using subtraction. Let's think of 87 - 35 = 52. Then 52 * 16 = 832. Then adding 53 would get 832 +53=885. Close to 900 but 15 short. Hmm. Alternatively, 53*16=848. 848 + something. 848 + 87=935, minus 35=900. Wait! Wait, that could work. Let me check:\n\n53 * 16 = 848. Then 848 +87 = 935. Then 935 -35 = 900. So that would use all numbers: 53*16 +87 -35. Let me check the operations. Yes: 53 multiplied by 16, then add 87, then subtract 35. All numbers used once. Let me compute that:\n\n53*16: 50*16=800, 3*16=48, so 800+48=848.\n\n848 +87=935. 935 -35=900. Yes! That works. So the equation is (53 * 16) + 87 - 35 = 900. Let me check if I used all numbers: 53, 16, 87, 35. Yes, each once. All operations are allowed. So that should be the answer.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(53 * 16) + 87 - 35 = 900</answer>"}]}

Hmm, where do I start? Let me list the numbers and think about possible combinations.\n\nFirst, 52 is the largest number here. Maybe I can add or subtract something from 52 to get close to 65. Let's try adding. 52 + 15 = 67, which is 2 more than 65. Then, if I can subtract 2, that would work. But how do I get 2 from the remaining numbers 4 and 3? 4 - 3 = 1, which isn't 2. Alternatively, 4 divided by something? Wait, 4 divided by 2 is 2, but I don't have a 2. Maybe 3 - (4/ something). Not sure. Maybe that approach isn't working.\n\nAlternatively, what if I multiply some numbers? Let's see. 15 multiplied by 4 is 60. Then 60 plus 3 is 63, which is still 2 short. But again, I have 52 left. Wait, but I need to use all numbers. So maybe combining 52 with others. Let's try 52 + 15 = 67. Then if I subtract 4 and 3, that's 67 - 4 -3 = 60, which is not enough. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe 52 + something. Let's see. 52 + 15 is 67, then subtract 2. But how to get 2 from 4 and 3. 4 - 3 =1. Not enough. Alternatively, 3 - (4/ something). Not helpful. Maybe division. Let's see. If I take 52 and add 15, that's 67. Then subtract (4/3). But 4/3 is roughly 1.333, so 67 - 1.333 is around 65.666. Close but not exact. And I can't use fractions here because the problem requires exact equality. So that might not work.\n\nWhat if I use multiplication with 15 and 4? 15*4=60. Then 60 plus 3 is 63. But then how to use 52? Wait, maybe 52 + (15 - (4*3)). Let's compute that: 15 - 12 = 3. Then 52 +3=55. No, that's not 65. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 52 + (15 - 3) = 52 +12=64. Then add 1 more? But I only have 4 left. Oh, but 4/4 is 1, but I can't reuse 4. Wait, I have to use all numbers once. So maybe 52 + (15 - (4 -3))? Let's see: 4-3=1. 15-1=14. 52+14=66. Close but not 65.\n\nWait another approach. What if I multiply 15 and 3? 15*3=45. Then add 4 to get 49. Then add 52 would be 101. That's way over. Not helpful.\n\nWhat about subtraction? 52 - 15=37. Then 37* something? 37* (4-3)=37*1=37. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe divide 52 by something. 52 divided by 4 is 13. Then 13 +15 +3=31. No. Not 65.\n\nHmm. Let's think of combining operations differently. Maybe 52 + 15 + 3 +4= 74. That's too much. But maybe with some operations. Like 52 + (15 * (something)).\n\nWait, 15 multiplied by 4 is 60, plus 3 is 63. Then 52 +63=115, which is way over. No.\n\nWait, perhaps 52 - (something) =65. So 52 - x=65 implies x=-13. So I need to make -13 using 15,4,3. Let's see. 15 - (4*3)=15-12=3. Not -13. 3-15= -12, but then -12 -4= -16. Not helpful. Maybe (3 -15) *4= (-12)*4=-48. Then 52 - (-48)=100. Not 65. Doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (15 + 4) *3=19*3=57. Then 57 +52=109. No. Not helpful.\n\nAnother angle: 52 + something =65. So the something is 13. Can I get 13 from 15, 4, 3? 15 - (4 -3)=14. No. 15 - (4/3)=15 -1.333…≈13.666. Not exact. 15 - (3 +4)=8. Not 13. 15 -3 -4=8. 15/(4-3)=15. Hmm. No. 3*4=12. 12 + something? 12 +1=13. But 1 from where? Can't reuse numbers.\n\nWait, perhaps 52 + (15 - (4 -3))? Let's check: 4-3=1, 15-1=14. 52+14=66. Close. Not 65. What if 52 + (15 -4 -3)=52 +8=60. No.\n\nWait, maybe 52 + (3*(15-4)). Let's compute 15-4=11. 3*11=33. 52+33=85. No. Not 65.\n\nAlternatively, 52 + 3*4=52+12=64. Then add 1 from 15? But how? Wait, 15 is left. Wait, no, we have to use all numbers. So if I use 3*4, that's 3 and 4 used. Then 52 +12=64, but then 15 is left. How can I get 1 more? But I can't combine 15 with anything else. So 64 +15=79. No. Not helpful.\n\nHmm. Let's try different approach. Let's think of 65 as 60 +5. How to get 60 and 5 from the numbers. 15*4=60. Then 52-3=49. Not helpful. Or 52- (something)=5. 52-47=5. How to get 47? Not sure. Alternatively, 52 divided by something. 52/4=13. Then 13*5=65. But where do I get the 5? 15/3=5. Oh! Wait, here's an idea. \n\nIf I do 52 divided by 4, that's 13. Then multiply by (15 divided by 3), which is 5. So 13*5=65. Let's check: (52 /4) * (15 /3) =13 *5=65. Yes! But wait, have I used all numbers? Let's see: 52,4,15,3. Each used once. Yes. So the equation would be (52 / 4) * (15 / 3) =65. That works! But I need to write it using all numbers once. Let me check again: 52 divided by 4 is 13, 15 divided by 3 is 5, then multiply them. So yes, all numbers are used once. \n\nWait, but the problem says \"create an equation\" so it needs to equal 65. So the equation would be (52 / 4) * (15 / 3) =65. But in the required format, just the expression. So like (52/4)*(15/3). Let me check that: 52/4=13, 15/3=5, 13*5=65. Yes! That works. So that's the answer.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(52 / 4) * (15 / 3)</answer>"}]}

The operations allowed are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let's look at the target number: 886. That's a pretty large number. The numbers given include 960, which is the largest. Maybe I can use 960 as a starting point. If I subtract something from 960 to get 886, then the difference would be 960 - 886 = 74. So I need to make 74 using the remaining numbers: 78, 23, and 27. But wait, 78 is bigger than 74. Hmm, maybe that's not the right path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 960 divided by something? Let's see. 960 divided by a number close to 1.085 would give around 886, but that seems complicated. Maybe multiplication? 78 times something. Let's see: 78*11 is 858, which is less than 886. 78*12 is 936. Hmm. 23*38.5 is 886, but we don't have 38.5. Maybe another approach.\n\nWhat if I use 23 and 27? Let's see: 23 + 27 is 50, which is small. 27 - 23 is 4. Maybe multiplying them: 23*27=621. Then 621 plus some number. 886 - 621 = 265. Do we have 265 left? The remaining numbers would be 78 and 960. 78 + 960 is 1038, way too big. Maybe 960 - 78 is 882. Then 882 + 621 is 1503. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe combining 960 and 78. Let's try 960 - 78 = 882. Then 882 is close to 886. So 882 + something. The remaining numbers are 23 and 27. 23 + 27 = 50. 882 + 50 = 932, which is over. Alternatively, 27 - 23 = 4. So 882 + 4 = 886! Oh, that could work. Let me check that again.\n\nSo 960 - 78 = 882. Then 27 - 23 = 4. Adding those two results: 882 + 4 = 886. But wait, how do we combine these using all the numbers? Because each number must be used exactly once. So the equation would be (960 - 78) + (27 - 23) = 886. Let's verify:\n\n960 - 78 is 882. 27 -23 is 4. 882 +4 is 886. Yes! And all numbers are used once. That works. So the equation is (960 - 78) + (27 - 23) = 886.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(960 - 78) + (27 - 23) = 886</answer>"}]}

Let me start by thinking about the target number, 983. It's a little under 1000, so maybe subtraction or division could be involved. But let's look at the numbers I have.\n\nFirst, the largest number here is 917. If I can somehow use that to get close to 983, maybe by adding or subtracting the other numbers. Let's try adding: 917 + 62 = 979. That's close, but 979 is 4 less than 983. Then maybe add another number. But wait, I have to use all numbers. So 917 + 62 + 93 = 917 + 62 is 979, plus 93 is 1072, which is way over. Hmm. Maybe subtract instead. 917 - 62 = 855. Then 855 + 93 = 948, and 948 +89= 1037. Still not close.\n\nAlternatively, maybe multiply some numbers. Let's see. 917 minus something. If I take 917 and subtract, say, 93, that's 824. Then maybe add 89: 824 +89=913. Still need 62 left. Hmm. 913 +62=975. No. Not enough. Maybe 917 -93=824, then 824 + (89* something). Wait, 89* something. Let's see, 89*11=979, which is close to 983. But how to get 11? If I use 62 and 93. 62 - 93= -31. Not helpful. 93 -62=31. Still not 11. Maybe 93 / something. 93 divided by 9 is about 10.333... but 9 isn't one of our numbers. Hmm. Alternatively, 62 divided by something. Wait, 62 divided by 5.6, but again, not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe I need to use division to get a smaller number. Let's think. For example, 917 - (93 - 89) * 62. Let's compute that. 93 -89=4. 4*62=248. 917-248=669. Not close. Hmm. What if I do 917 + (something involving 93 and 89). Let's try 93 +89=182. 917 +182=1099. Then subtract 62: 1099-62=1037. Still over.\n\nWhat if I multiply 62 and 93. 62*93=5766. That's way too big. Then subtract 917 and add 89. 5766 -917=4849 +89=4938. Way over. Not helpful.\n\nMaybe using division. Let's see. 917 divided by something. 917/93 ≈9.86. Then 9.86*62≈611. Then add 89: 700. Not close.\n\nAlternatively, 917 divided by 89. Let me calculate that. 917 ÷89. 89*10=890, 917-890=27. So 10 + 27/89≈10.303. Then multiply by 93? 10.303*93≈958. Then add 62? 958+62=1020. Still over.\n\nHmm. Maybe subtract something from 917. 917 - (93 +89) = 917 - 182=735. Then 735 +62=797. No, not enough.\n\nWait, 917 -62=855. Then 855 +89=944. Then 944 +93=1037. Still over. How else can I combine these?\n\nAlternatively, maybe use 917 and 62 to make a larger number, but I'm not sure. Let's try 917 + 62=979. Then need 4 more to get 983. But the remaining numbers are 93 and 89. How to get 4 from 93 and 89? 93-89=4. Oh! Wait, that's 4. So maybe 917 +62 + (93 -89) = 917 +62 +4=983. Let's check: 917 +62 is 979, plus 4 is 983. Then the equation would be 917 +62 + (93 -89) = 983. But does that use all numbers? Let's see: 917, 62, 93, 89. Yes! Each is used once, and all are used. So the equation would be 917 + 62 + (93 - 89) = 983. Let me verify the arithmetic:\n\n93 -89 =4.\n\nThen 917 +62=979. 979 +4=983. Exactly! That works. So the equation is 917 +62 +93 -89 =983. Alternatively, grouped as (917 +62) + (93 -89). Either way, all numbers are used once with each operation. So this should be the answer.\n</think>\n\n<answer>917 + 62 + 93 - 89 = 983</answer>"}]}

Each number has to be used exactly once, and the result should be 29. Hmm. Alright, let's start by thinking about the target number, which is 29. Since 29 is one of the numbers provided, maybe I can find a way to subtract or add the other numbers in a way that cancels out or combines to leave 29.\n\nFirst, let me list the numbers: 29, 2, 13, 26. The operations allowed are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Each number must be used once. So the equation will have all four numbers, each used once, connected by operations to equal 29.\n\nLet me try different combinations. Let's see. If I take 29 and somehow use the other numbers to get zero or something. For example, 29 + (something - something else). Let's see. Let's consider 26 and 13. 26 divided by 13 is 2. Wait, 26 /13 is 2. So if I do 26 /13 = 2, then I have 2 and 2 left. But I already have a 2 in the numbers. Wait, the numbers are 29, 2, 13, 26. So if I do 26 divided by 13, that's 2, but I already have a 2. So maybe I can use that to create a subtraction or addition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 26 - 13 is 13. Then 13 plus 2 is 15, which doesn't help. Hmm. Let's try combining 26 and 2. 26 divided by 2 is 13. So 26 /2 =13. Then we have 29 and 13 left. If I subtract 13 from 29, that's 16. Not helpful. Wait, maybe 29 - (26/2) =29 -13=16. Not 29. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 29 plus 13 is 42. Then 26 minus 2 is 24. 42 minus 24 is 18. Nope. Not helpful.\n\nWhat if I do multiplication? Let's see. 2 multiplied by 13 is 26. Then 26 plus 26 is 52, but we already used 2 and 13, so that's not allowed. Wait, but maybe 29 plus (26 - (13 * 2))? Let's compute that. 13 *2 is 26. Then 26 -26=0. So 29 +0=29. But wait, the numbers used would be 29, 13, 2, 26. Yes, that's all four. Wait, so that would be 29 + (26 - (13 * 2)) =29 + (26 -26)=29 +0=29. But let me check the usage: 29, 26, 13, 2. All used once. So the equation would be 29 + (26 - 13 * 2). Wait, order of operations here. Since multiplication comes before subtraction and addition. So 13*2 is 26, then 26 -26=0, then 29 +0=29. That works. So the equation is 29 + (26 - 13 * 2) =29. Let me verify: 13*2=26, 26-26=0, 29+0=29. Yes. That uses all numbers once. So that's possible. Let me write that as an equation: 29 + (26 - 13 * 2) =29. But wait, do I need to use all the numbers? Let's check. 29 is used, 26, 13, 2. All four. So that works. Alternatively, maybe there's another way, but this seems to fit.\n\nLet me see if there's another way. For example, 29 - (26/13 - 2). Let's compute. 26/13=2, so 2 -2=0. Then 29 -0=29. But that would be 29 - ( (26/13) -2 ) =29 - (2-2)=29 -0=29. But here, we used 29,26,13,2. All four. So that's another possibility: 29 - (26/13 -2)=29. Let's check the calculation: 26 divided by 13 is 2, subtract 2, gives 0, then 29 minus 0 is 29. That works. So the equation is 29 - (26/13 - 2) =29. But in this case, parentheses are important. So the equation is 29 - ( (26 /13) -2 )=29. Both equations work. Which one is more straightforward?\n\nAlternatively, maybe using subtraction and addition in another way. Let's think: 29 is the target. If we can get the other numbers to sum up to zero. For example, 2 +13 +26=41. That's not zero. But 26 -13 -2=11. Then 29 -11=18. Not helpful.\n\nWait, but in the first approach I had, using 13*2=26, then 26-26=0, adding to 29. So the equation is 29 + (26 -13*2). Or written as 29 + (26 - (13*2)). That works. So the answer is that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 29 = (26 + 2) - (13 - something). Hmm. Let's see. 26 +2=28. Then 28 - (13 - x) =29. So 28 -13 +x =29. So 15 +x=29. Therefore x=14. But we don't have 14. So that might not work.\n\nAnother approach: 13 and 2. 13-2=11. Then 26-11=15. 29-15=14. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe 26 divided by 2 is 13. Then 13 +13=26. But we already used 26 and 2. So not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 29 - 26=3. Then 13 -2=11. 3 +11=14. Not helpful.\n\nWait, let me check the first solution again. 29 + (26 -13*2). Let's compute step by step. 13*2=26. 26-26=0. 29+0=29. That works. All numbers used once. So that's a valid equation. Another way is 29 - (26/13 -2). Let's check: 26/13=2. 2-2=0. 29-0=29. Also valid. So both equations work. But which one uses the numbers in the required way? Let me check the first one: uses 29, 26, 13, 2. The second one: same. So either is acceptable. But perhaps the first one is simpler in terms of operations. Let's write them:\n\nFirst solution: 29 + (26 - 13 * 2)\n\nSecond solution: 29 - (26 /13 - 2)\n\nEither would work, but let's see if the problem requires a specific format. The problem says you can use basic arithmetic operations one or multiple times, so both are possible. The first uses multiplication and subtraction and addition, the second uses division, subtraction, and addition. Both are acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe another combination. Let's try. 29 + 2 - (26 -13). So 29 +2=31. 26-13=13. 31-13=18. No.\n\nOr 29 - 2 + (26 -13). 29-2=27, 26-13=13, 27+13=40. Not 29.\n\nHmm. Let's see another angle. Maybe multiply two numbers. 26 and 2. 26*2=52. Then 52 divided by 13 is 4. Then 4 +29=33. Not 29.\n\nAlternatively, 26*13 is 338, which is way too big. Not useful.\n\nWhat about 26 -13=13. Then 13*2=26. Then 29 -26=3. Not helpful.\n\nWait, 29 is already a number. So perhaps if I can use the other three numbers to make 0, then 29 +0=29. Let's think. How can 2,13,26 make 0? Let's see. 26 -13*2=26-26=0. So yes, that's what the first equation does. So 29 + (26 -13*2)=29. That's the solution.\n\nAlternatively, 26/13=2. Then 2-2=0. So 29 +0=29. That's the second equation. Either way, the same idea. So both equations are valid. Let me check if parentheses are needed. For the first equation: 29 + 26 -13*2. Without parentheses, according to order of operations, multiplication comes first. So 13*2=26, then 29+26=55, 55-26=29. Wait, that's a different calculation. Wait, so 29 +26 -13*2 would be 29 +26 =55, 13*2=26, then 55-26=29. So that's another way. Wait, but does that use all numbers? Let me check. 29,26,13,2. Yes. So the equation 29 +26 -13*2=29. Let's compute: 13*2=26. 29+26=55. 55-26=29. So that works. So the equation is 29 +26 -13*2=29. All numbers used once. So that's another possibility. Wait, that's simpler. Because it doesn't need parentheses. Because according to order of operations, multiplication is done first. So the calculation is 29 +26 - (13*2). So 29+26=55, 13*2=26, then 55-26=29. Yes. So the equation is 29 +26 -13*2=29. Let me check again: 29,26,13,2 all used once. Yes. So this is another valid equation. That's better because it doesn't require nested parentheses. So this might be the answer.\n\nWait, so if I write it as 29 +26 -13*2. That's correct. Let me check the order of operations. Multiplication first:13*2=26. Then 29+26=55. 55-26=29. Perfect. So that's the equation. So the equation is 29 +26 -13*2=29. But I need to make sure that all numbers are used. 29,26,13,2: yes. Each used once. So that's the correct answer. So I think this is the simplest way.\n</think>\n\n<answer>29 + 26 - 13 * 2</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using the numbers 2, 41, 48, and 8 exactly once each, with basic arithmetic operations, to equal 233. Hmm. Let's start by thinking about what operations can get me close to 233. \n\nFirst, 41 is a prime number, so maybe multiplying it by something. If I take 41 times 5, that's 205, which is 28 less than 233. But how do I get 5 from the remaining numbers 2, 48, 8? Wait, 48 divided by 8 is 6. Then 6 minus 2 is 4. Hmm, not 5. Alternatively, maybe 8 divided by 2 is 4, then 4 plus something. But then 41*4 would be 164, which is too low. \n\nAlternatively, if I use 48 and 8. 48 minus 8 is 40. Then 40 plus 2 is 42. 42 times something... but 42*5 is 210, which is still 23 short. Maybe not the right path. \n\nWait, 233 is a prime number. So maybe adding or subtracting to get there. Let's think about 41*5 + 48. 41*5 is 205, plus 48 is 253. That's over by 20. But how to adjust. Maybe subtract 20? But where to get that. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, 48*5 is 240, which is 7 more than 233. So 48*5 -7. But how to get 5 and 7 from remaining numbers. Wait, if I use 41 and 8: 8 - (41/ something). Not sure. \n\nWait, let's try to break it down. Let's see, 233 divided by 41 is approximately 5.68. So maybe 41*5 + something. But how to get to 5 using 48,8,2. Let's see: 48 divided by 8 is 6. 6 minus 2 is 4. So 41*4 = 164, then plus 48 +8 +2? No, but we have to use all numbers once. Wait, 41*(48/(8+2)) = 41*(48/10)= 41*4.8= 196.8. Not an integer. And we need exact. \n\nAlternatively, maybe 41 + 48* something. 48*5 is 240, so 240 +41=281, which is over. Then subtract 48? Wait, but can't reuse numbers. Hmm. \n\nWait, maybe using division. Let's see. Let's consider 48 and 8. 48 divided by 8 is 6. Then 6*41=246. 246 minus 13 is 233. How to get 13 from the remaining numbers. The remaining number is 2. So 13 from 2? Not possible. Alternatively, maybe 246 minus (something). Wait, 246 - 13 = 233, but I don't have 13. Wait, maybe 48/8 =6, then 6*41=246, then 246 - (2 + something else). But all numbers must be used. Wait, already used 48,8,41, so the remaining number is 2. So 246 -2=244. Not 233. Hmm. \n\nAnother approach: Maybe 41*8=328. Then 328 - something. 328-95=233. How to get 95 from 48 and 2. 48*2=96. 96-1=95, but I don't have 1. Alternatively, 48*2=96, so 328-96=232. Close, but 1 off. Then maybe 41*8 -48/2= 328 -24=304. No, that's not 233. \n\nWait, let's think about 233-41=192. So 192 needs to be made from 48,8,2. 48*4=192. How to get 4 from 8 and 2. 8 divided by 2=4. So 48*(8/2)=48*4=192. Then 192 +41=233. Oh! That works. Let me check: 48 divided by (8/2) would be 48/(4)=12. Wait, no, I think the order of operations matters. Wait, if I do 48*(8 divided by 2), which is 48*(4)=192. Then add 41. So the equation would be 48*(8/2) +41 = 48*4 +41=192 +41=233. Yes! And all numbers are used: 48,8,2,41. Perfect.\n</think>\n\n<answer>48 * (8 / 2) + 41 = 233</answer>"}]}

Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the target number, 364. Let me see what 364 factors into. Maybe that can help. 364 divided by 4 is 91, so 4*91=364. But I don't have a 4 here. Alternatively, 364 is 350 +14, which might not help. Let me check 84 multiplied by something. 84*4 is 336, which is close. 364 -336 is 28. Hmm, 28. Do I have a way to get 28 from the remaining numbers? The numbers left would be 8, 48, 26. Wait, but I need to use all numbers. So, maybe using 84 and some other numbers to multiply and then add or subtract.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 48 and 8. 48*8 is 384. That's larger than 364. If I subtract 20 from 384, that's 364. Do I have 20? Well, I have 26 and 84. Maybe 26 - (something). Let's see: 84 - 26 is 58. Not 20. Alternatively, 84 divided by something. 84/4 is 21, but I don't have a 4. Hmm.\n\nWait, the numbers I have are 84, 8, 48, 26. Let's list them again. Let me think about combining them in different ways. Maybe (84 * 48) is a big number. Let's calculate that: 84*48=4032. That's way too big. How about division? Maybe 84 divided by 8, which is 10.5. Then multiply by something else. 10.5*26=273. Then add 48? 273+48=321. Not enough.\n\nAnother approach: 26 is a big number. If I can get 364 by multiplying 26 by something. 26*14=364. So, can I get 14 from the remaining numbers: 84, 8, 48. Let's see. 84 - 48 is 36. 36 -8=28. Not 14. 84/(48/8). Let's see: 48/8=6, then 84/6=14. Oh! That works. So, 84 divided by (48 divided by 8) gives 14, and then multiply by 26. So the equation would be (84 / (48 / 8)) * 26. Let me check the calculation step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate 48 divided by 8: 48/8=6. Then 84 divided by 6 is 14. Then 14 multiplied by 26 is 14*26=364. Yes, that works! All numbers are used once: 84, 48, 8, 26. The operations are division and multiplication. So the equation is (84 / (48 / 8)) * 26.

Let me start by thinking about what operations could get me to 825.\n\nFirst, 825 is a pretty large number. Let me check the multiplication possibilities. Since 55 and 50 are the two largest numbers here, maybe multiplying them could get close. 55 * 50 is 2750, which is way larger than 825. So maybe I need to divide that product by something. Let's see: 2750 divided by something to get 825. Let's calculate 2750 / 825 ≈ 3.333... So if I can get a 3.333 from the remaining numbers 6 and 20, that might work. Wait, 20 divided by 6 is approximately 3.333. So maybe (55 * 50) / (20 / 6). Let's check that. 55*50 is 2750. 20/6 is about 3.333. 2750 divided by 3.333 is approximately 825. But let's calculate exactly. 20/6 simplifies to 10/3. So 2750 divided by (10/3) is 2750 * 3/10 = 825. Yes, that works! So the equation would be (55 * 50) / (20 / 6). Let me verify: 55*50=2750, 20/6=10/3, then 2750/(10/3)=2750*3/10=825. Perfect. But wait, did I use all numbers? Yes: 55, 50, 20, 6. All used once. So the equation is (55 * 50) / (20 / 6) = 825. That seems to work. Let me check if there's another way, but this looks correct. Alternatively, maybe using subtraction or addition. But considering the numbers, this multiplication and division approach seems the most straightforward. Let me see another approach. For example, 55*15=825, but how to get 15 from 50,6,20. Maybe 50 - (20 + 6* something). Not sure. Alternatively, 55*(50 - (20/ something)). Let's see. If I do 50 - (20/6) = 50 - 3.333...=46.666, then 55*46.666 is about 2566. Not helpful. Alternatively, maybe 55*(6 + 20/ something). 6 + (20/50)=6.4, 55*6.4=352. No. Hmm. So the first approach seems better. Yes, the division approach works. So the equation is (55 * 50) divided by (20 divided by 6), which simplifies correctly to 825. So I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(55 * 50) / (20 / 6)</answer>"}]}

Hmm, let's see. \n\nFirst, I should think about the target number, 441. Let me recall that 441 is 21 squared, so maybe that can help in terms of factors. But how can I get there with these numbers? Let's see. The numbers given are all over the place in terms of size. 695 is the largest, followed by 333, then 62 and 17. \n\nSince 695 is a big number, maybe subtracting it by something could get closer to 441. Let's check: 695 minus 333 is 362. That's lower than 441. If I subtract 62 from 695, that's 633. Hmm, still higher than 441. Maybe 695 minus (something) would work. Alternatively, adding 333 and 62 and 17 would be 333 + 62 = 395, plus 17 is 412. Still not 441. \n\nAlternatively, maybe multiplying some of the smaller numbers. Let's see. 62 * 17 is 1054. That's a big number. Maybe that can be subtracted from 695? 695 - (62*17) = 695 - 1054 = -359. Not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, 333 divided by something. 333 divided by 17 is roughly 19.58. That might not help. 333 divided by 62 is around 5.37. Hmm. \n\nWait, maybe combining 695 and 333. If I do 695 minus 333, that's 362. Then I need to get from 362 to 441 using the remaining numbers 17 and 62. 441 - 362 = 79. So I need to make 79 with 17 and 62. 62 +17 is 79. So that would be 695 - 333 + 62 +17. Let me check: 695 -333 is 362, plus 62 is 424, plus 17 is 441. Oh! Wait, that works. Let me check again: 695 - 333 = 362; 362 +62 = 424; 424 +17 = 441. Yes! So the equation would be 695 - 333 + 62 +17 = 441. But wait, does that use all numbers once? Yes: 695, 333, 62, 17. All used once. So that's a possible solution. \n\nBut let me make sure there isn't another way. Maybe using multiplication or division. Let's see. For example, 333 - 62 is 271. Then 271 * 17 is 4607, which is way too big. Or 333/17 is around 19.58, then 695 - 19.58 is 675.42, not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, 17 * 62 is 1054, as before. Then 1054 - 695 = 359. 359 +333 = 692. Not close. \n\nAnother approach: 695 divided by something. 695 divided by 17 is approximately 40.88. Then 333 - 40.88 is around 292.12, which doesn't help. \n\nAlternatively, 333 + 695 = 1028. Then subtract something. 1028 - 62 = 966. Then 966 -17 = 949. Not 441. \n\nWait, maybe combining 62 and 17 as 62 -17 =45. Then 45 * something? 45*9.8 = 441. But how to get 9.8 from the remaining numbers 333 and 695? Not straightforward. \n\nAlternatively, 333 - (695 / (62 -17)). Let's compute 62 -17 =45. Then 695 /45 ≈15.444. Then 333 -15.444 ≈317.556. Not 441. \n\nAnother idea: 333 * (something). Let's see. 333 *1.333 is 444, which is close to 441. Hmm. 1.333 is 4/3, but how to get that? Maybe 695 divided by (62 +17). 62 +17=79. 695/79 is 8.797. 333 * (695/79) is way bigger. \n\nAlternatively, 695 - (333 - (62 +17)). Let's compute: 62 +17 =79. 333 -79=254. 695 -254=441. Wait, that's exactly the same as before! Because 695 -333 +62 +17 is the same as 695 - (333 -62 -17). Let me verify:\n\n695 - (333 -62 -17) = 695 - (333 -79) = 695 -254 =441. So yes, that's another way to write it. But the original equation I thought of is 695 -333 +62 +17. Both are valid, but using different grouping. However, the problem allows using each number once and all operations, but parentheses can be used for grouping. \n\nBut the question says to create an equation using all numbers once with basic operations. So the equation 695 -333 +62 +17 =441 uses all numbers once and the operations + and -. So that's a valid solution. \n\nWait, but the problem statement says \"using the numbers 17, 62, 333, 695\" and \"each number can only be used once, and you must use all the numbers\". So in this equation, all four numbers are used once. The operations are -, +, +. So that's allowed. \n\nSo I think that's a valid solution. Let me check again:\n\n695 -333 = 362\n\n362 +62 = 424\n\n424 +17 =441. \n\nYes, that adds up correctly. \n\nSo the equation would be (695 - 333) + 62 + 17 = 441, but since addition and subtraction are left associative, it could also be written as 695 - 333 + 62 + 17. Either way, it's the same result. \n\nAlternatively, if we need to use all four operations, but the problem states \"basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) one or multiple times\", so it's allowed to use only some of them. Since this uses -, +, +, it's okay. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 695 - 333 + 62 + 17 = 441. So in the required format, the equation is (695 - 333) + 62 + 17, but parentheses may not be necessary. However, to make it clear, maybe (695 - 333) + 62 + 17. But since the user didn't specify the need for minimal parentheses, just the equation, perhaps writing it as 695 - 333 + 62 + 17. \n\nAnother check: Are there any other possible equations? Let's see. \n\nSuppose we try 333 + 62 = 395. Then 695 - 395 = 300. 300 +17=317. Not 441. \n\nAlternatively, 333 * something. Let's see, 333 + 695 =1028. 1028 - 62=966. 966 /17=56.823. Not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, 17 * 62=1054. 1054 -695=359. 359 +333=692. Not 441. \n\nAnother idea: 62 * 7 =434, close to 441. 7 is not directly, but maybe 333 / something. 333 divided by 17 is ~19.58. 19.58 +62=81.58. Not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, 333 - (695 / (62 -17)). 62-17=45. 695/45≈15.444. 333-15.444≈317.556. Not 441. \n\nHmm. It seems like the first solution is the only straightforward one. So the equation is 695 -333 +62 +17=441. \n\nTherefore, the answer is <answer>695 - 333 + 62 + 17</answer>\n</think>\n\n<answer>695 - 333 + 62 + 17</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using all the numbers 75, 35, 91, and 48 exactly once, with basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) any number of times, and the result should be 179. Hmm. Let me start by thinking about possible combinations.\n\nFirst, maybe I can try adding some numbers and subtracting others. Let's see what happens if I add the larger numbers first. 75 and 91 are both big. 75 + 91 = 166. Then maybe add 35? 166 + 35 = 201. Then subtract 48? 201 - 48 = 153. That's too low. Not 179.\n\nAlternatively, what if I do 91 + 48 = 139. Then add 35: 139 +35=174. Then 75 - something? Wait, but I need to use all numbers once. So maybe 91 +48=139, then 35 +75=110. Hmm, 139 +110=249, which is way over. Maybe subtract instead. 139 - 110=29. Not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps multiplication or division can help. Let's see. 75 * something. 75*2=150. If I can get 150 + something. Let's see. 75*2=150, but I need to use the other numbers. Maybe 75 + (91 - 35) +48? Let's calculate that. 91-35=56. Then 75+56=131. Then 131+48=179. Wait, that's 75 + (91 -35) +48. Let me check: 75 +56=131, then +48=179. But does that use all numbers? Let's see: 75, 91, 35, 48—all used once. But the operations are subtraction and addition. So the equation would be 75 + 91 - 35 + 48 = 179. Wait, let me check the arithmetic again. 75+91 is 166. 166-35 is 131. 131+48 is 179. Yes, that works! But wait, does that use all the numbers? Yes, each number is used once, and all four are used. So the equation would be 75 + 91 - 35 + 48 = 179. Hmm, that seems too straightforward. Let me verify again. 75+91=166. 166-35=131. 131+48=179. Yep, that's correct. So maybe that's the solution. But let me make sure there are no other possibilities or if I made a mistake in considering operations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using multiplication. For example, 48 is a multiple of 16, but not sure. Let's see: 75 + 35 = 110. 91 +48=139. 110 +139=249. No. Or 91 -48=43. 43 +35=78. 75 +78=153. No. What if I do 91 divided by something. 91/35 is approximately 2.6, which might not be helpful. 75 * (48/35) ≈75*1.37≈102. Then 102 +91=193. Still not 179. Hmm.\n\nWait another idea: 75 - (48 / (91 -35)). Let's compute that. 91-35=56. 48/56 is approximately 0.857. Then 75 -0.857≈74.143. Not helpful. How about (75 +35) * something. 75+35=110. 110 * something. If I multiply by 1.6, which is 48/30, but not sure. Maybe (75 +35) + (91 -48) =110 +43=153. Still no. Alternatively, 75*2=150. But I need to use all numbers. 75* (something) plus others. Maybe 75* (48/ (91 -35)) ) +35. Let's calculate denominator first: 91-35=56. 48/56≈0.857. 75*0.857≈64.28. Then +35≈99.28. Not 179.\n\nAnother approach: 91 +48=139. 139 +35=174. 174 +5=179. Where can I get the 5? Maybe 75-70=5. But 70 isn't part of the numbers. Alternatively, 75 /15=5. But 15 isn't there. Wait, maybe 75 - (something) =5. But how? Hmm.\n\nWait, the first solution I found was 75 +91 -35 +48=179. That uses all numbers once with addition and subtraction. Let me check if that's allowed. The problem states that each number can be used once and all must be used, and operations can be any of the basic ones. So yes, that equation is valid. So maybe that's the correct answer. Let me just confirm once again. 75 +91 is 166. 166 -35 is 131. 131 +48 is 179. Yep. So the equation is 75 + 91 - 35 + 48 = 179. So I think that's the solution.\n</think>\n\n<answer>75 + 91 - 35 + 48 = 179</answer>"}]}

The operations allowed are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Hmm, 872 is a pretty big number, so maybe multiplication will be involved here. Let's start by looking at the numbers I have.\n\nFirst, the largest number here is 316. If I can multiply that by something, maybe that gets me close. Let's see: 316 times 2 is 632, which is less than 872. But I don't have a 2. Wait, but maybe I can create a 2 by using the other numbers. Let me check. The other numbers are 9, 37, and 95. If I subtract 37 from 95, that gives me 58. Not helpful. Or 95 divided by something? 95 divided by 9 is about 10.5, which isn't an integer. Maybe 9 plus 37 is 46, but then 316 times 46 would be way too big. Hmm, maybe that's not the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe combining 95 and 37 first. 95 minus 37 is 58. If I then multiply that by 9, 58 * 9 = 522. Then 522 plus 316 is 838, which is still less than 872. Not enough. Or if I do 95 plus 37, that's 132. 132 multiplied by 9 is 1188. Then subtract 316: 1188 - 316 = 872? Wait, let me check that. 1188 minus 300 is 888, minus 16 is 872. Oh! That works. Wait, but hold on. Let me break that down. So 95 + 37 = 132. Then 132 * 9 = 1188. Then 1188 - 316 = 872. But wait, are all numbers used once? Let me check: 95, 37, 9, and 316. Yes, all four numbers are used. So the equation would be (95 + 37) * 9 - 316 = 872. Let me verify that again.\n\nCalculating 95 plus 37 first: 95 + 37 = 132. Multiply by 9: 132 * 9. Let me compute that. 132 * 9: 100*9=900, 30*9=270, 2*9=18. So 900 + 270 = 1170 + 18 = 1188. Then subtract 316: 1188 - 316. 1188 - 300 = 888, then minus 16 is 872. Yes, that works. So the equation is (95 + 37) * 9 - 316 = 872. And all numbers are used once. That seems to fit the requirements. Let me check if there's another way, but this seems to work. I think that's the solution.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(95 + 37) * 9 - 316 = 872</answer>"}]}

The 2 is small. Maybe subtracting larger numbers?\n\nWait, 76 minus 35 is 41. Then 70 divided by 2 is 35. Hmm, 41 minus 35 is 6. Not helpful. What if I rearrange that?\n\nAlternatively, 70 divided by 35 is 2. But we already have a 2. Oh, but we can only use each number once. So maybe that's not allowed. Let's see. If I do 70 divided by 35, that's 2, but then we already have the original 2, which would be using 70, 35, and 2, leaving 76. Not sure how to combine that into 27.\n\nWhat if I use subtraction? For example, 76 - 35 = 41. Then maybe 70 - 41 = 29. Not 27. Or 41 - (70/2). Wait, 70/2 is 35. So 41 -35 =6 again. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe multiply some numbers. Let's see. 2 times 35 is 70. But that uses 2, 35, and 70, leaving 76. How to get 27 from 76 and 70? Not sure.\n\nWait, 76 - 70 =6. Then 6 + something? But I need to use all numbers.

Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe combine 70 and 35 first. 70 divided by 35 is 2, but then we have two 2s. Not allowed. Alternatively, 70 -35=35. Then again, duplicates. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps using all the numbers in a different order. Let's consider 76 and 70. Their difference is 6. Then 35 divided by something. 35 divided by 2 is 17.5. 6 plus 17.5 is 23.5, not 27. Alternatively, 35 - (76-70) =35-6=29, as before.\n\nWhat if we do 35 - (76 / (70 /2 ))? Let's compute that. 70 divided by 2 is 35. Then 76 divided by 35 is approximately 2.171. Then 35 -2.171≈32.829. Not 27.\n\nWait, maybe parentheses matter. Let's think about combining numbers in different ways. For example, (70 - 76) + (35 * 2). That's (-6) +70=64. No.\n\nAlternatively, (76 - 70) * (35 -2). 6 *33=198. Way off.\n\nHmm. Maybe 35 - 2 =33, then 76 -70=6, so 33 -6=27. Wait, that uses 35,2,76,70. Let me check: 35 -2=33, 76-70=6, then 33 -6=27. Yes! But how to write that as an equation using all numbers once. Wait, the operations would be 35 -2 - (76 -70). Let's compute: 35-2=33, 76-70=6, so 33-6=27. But the equation would be (35 - 2) - (76 - 70) =27. Let's check: 35-2 is 33. 76-70 is 6. 33-6 is 27. Yes! So all numbers are used: 35,2,76,70. Each used once. Operations are subtraction and subtraction, but allowed. So the equation would be (35 - 2) - (76 - 70) =27. Let me verify again:\n\n35 -2 =33\n\n76 -70=6\n\n33 -6=27. Correct. That works.

If I multiply some of the bigger numbers together, maybe that'll get me close.\n\nLet's try multiplying 29 and 27. 29*27 is 783. That's more than 524. Hmm, maybe subtract something from that. 783 minus what? Let's see what numbers I have left: 11 and 10. If I subtract 11 and 10, that's 783 - 11 - 10 = 762. Still too high. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe multiply 29 by 11 first. 29*11 is 319. Then I have 27 and 10 left. How can I combine those? 27*10 is 270. 319 + 270 is 589. Still not 524. Closer, but over.\n\nWhat if I do 29*11 + 27 -10? 319 +27 is 346, minus 10 is 336. Nope.\n\nWait, maybe using division somewhere. Let's say I take 27 and divide by something. 27 divided by 10 is 2.7. Then multiply by 29? 29*2.7 is 78.3. Add 11? That's 89.3. Way too low.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 29 multiplied by (27 - 11). That's 29*16 = 464. Then add 10? 474. Still not enough. Or subtract 10? 454. No.\n\nWait, 29*18 is 522. Which is very close to 524. How can I get 18 from the remaining numbers? Let's see, I have 11, 27, 10. Hmm. 27 - (11 -10) = 26. No. 27 - 11 +10 = 26. Still not 18. Or 11 +10 =21, 27-21=6. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 27 - 10 =17, then 11 +17=28. But 29*28=812. Minus what? That's not helpful.\n\nWait another approach: 29*10=290. Then 290 plus 27*11. 27*11 is 297. 290 +297=587. Close but over.\n\nWhat if I do 29*11 +27*10. That's 319 +270=589. Still 589 again. Not useful.\n\nHmm. Maybe subtraction. Let's see. 29*27=783. Then subtract 11*10=110. 783-110=673. Still too high. 673-? But we already used all numbers. Wait, 783 - (11*10)=783-110=673. No, that's all numbers used. Not 524.\n\nAlternatively, 29* (27 - 11) +10. 29*(16)=464 +10=474. Not enough.\n\nWait, 524 divided by 29 is approximately 18.06. So if I can get 18.06 using 11,27,10. Not sure. Alternatively, 524 divided by 11 is around 47.63. Maybe 29 + 27 -10=46. 46*11=506. Close, but not 524.\n\nWait 506 is 18 less than 524. Hmm. Maybe that's not the way.\n\nAnother angle: 524 is 512 +12. 512 is 2^9, but not sure if exponents are allowed. The problem says basic operations, so probably not. So maybe 27*19.407... but not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe use division to create a larger number. For example, 27 divided by something. Let's see: 27/(10/11). That's 27*(11/10)=29.7. Then 29.7*29= approx 29.7*30=891 minus 29.7=861.3. No, too high.\n\nAlternatively, 11/(10) =1.1, then 27*1.1=29.7. Then 29.7*29= same as before.\n\nHmm. Let me think again. Let's see, maybe 29*11=319. Then 27*10=270. 319 +270=589. As before. But how to get from 589 to 524. That would require subtracting 65, but I don't have numbers left. Wait, but maybe combining operations differently.\n\nWait, maybe 29*(11+27) -10. Let's compute that: 11+27=38. 29*38=1102. 1102-10=1092. Way too high.\n\nAlternatively, 29*(27 -11) +10. 27-11=16. 29*16=464 +10=474. Still not.\n\nWait, what if I do (29 +27) * (11 -10). That's 56 *1=56. No.\n\nAlternatively, (29 -27) * (11 +10)=2*21=42. No.\n\nHmm. Maybe using division with the larger numbers. For example, 29*10=290. Then 27*11=297. 290 +297=587. Wait, that's the same as before. 587- what? But I can't use any numbers again.\n\nWait, maybe (29*11) + (27*10) =319 +270=589. 589 is 65 more than 524. But how to get that 65 subtracted? Since all numbers are used, perhaps rearrange operations.\n\nWait, maybe subtract instead of add. Let's try 29*11 -27*10= 319 -270=49. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 29*27 -11*10=783 -110=673. Still no.\n\nWait, 29* (11 +10) +27. 29*21=609 +27=636. Still over.\n\nAlternatively, 29*(11) + (27 -10)=319 +17=336. No.\n\nWait, maybe (29 +11) * (27 -10). 40 *17=680. Then 680 minus something? But we've already used all numbers. So 680 is the result here. No.\n\nHmm. Maybe 27*10=270. Then 270* something. 270*2=540, which is 16 more than 524. But how to get 2 from 29 and 11. 29-11=18. Not helpful. 11- (29-27)=9? Not sure.\n\nWait, another approach: 524 divided by 29 is approximately 18.06. So if I can somehow get 18.06 from 27, 11, and 10. Maybe 27 - (11 -10/ something). Let's see. 10 divided by something. For example, 27 - (11 -10) =27 -1=26. 26 is close to 18.06? No. Alternatively, 27 - 11 +10=26. Not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps 27* (11 - (10/29)). But 10/29 is approximately 0.345. 11 -0.345=10.655. 27*10.655≈287.685. Then adding 29? 287.685 +29≈316.685. No, that's not right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 29*(27 - (11/10)). Let's compute 11/10=1.1. 27-1.1=25.9. 29*25.9≈751.1. Then subtract what? But numbers are already used.\n\nThis is tricky. Maybe I need to use subtraction and multiplication together. Let's see.\n\nWait, 29*11=319. Then 319 +27=346. Then 346*10=3460. Way too high. Not useful.\n\nAlternatively, 29* (11 + (27 -10)). Let's compute 27-10=17. 11+17=28. 29*28=812. Then subtract something? But all numbers used.\n\nWait, 29* (27 +11) -10. 29*38=1102 -10=1092. No.\n\nHmm. Let's think differently. Maybe create a two-step multiplication with addition or subtraction.\n\nLike (29 + 11) * (27 -10) =40*17=680. Not helpful. Wait, 29+11=40, 27-10=17. 40*17=680. Then how to get 524? 680-156=524. But where does 156 come from? Not possible since all numbers are used.\n\nAlternatively, (29 -11)*(27 +10)=18*37=666. Still not 524.\n\nWait, 27*19 is 513. 513 +11=524. But how to get 19 from 29,10. 29-10=19. So maybe 27*(29-10) +11=27*19 +11=513 +11=524. Wait, that works!\n\nLet me check the numbers. 29 is used in (29-10), which is 19. Then 27*19=513, then add 11. So 27*(29 -10) +11. Let's verify:\n\n29 -10=19.\n\n27*19=513.\n\n513 +11=524.\n\nYes! And all numbers are used once: 29, 27, 10, 11. Perfect!\n</think>\n\n<answer>27 * (29 - 10) + 11</answer>"}]}

Hmm. Let's start by thinking about how these numbers can combine.\n\nFirst, maybe if I can make some larger numbers by multiplying. Let me check if 40 is a good starting point because it's the largest. If I multiply 40 by 3, that's 120, which is close to 122. But I don't have a 3, but maybe I can make a 3 from the other numbers. Wait, the numbers left are 21, 37, 24. Hmm. 24 divided by 21 is about 1.14, which isn't helpful. 37 minus 21 is 16. 24 minus 21 is 3. Oh, that's 3. So maybe 40 * 3 = 120, then add 2? But where do I get the 2? Alternatively, maybe 37 - 24 = 13. Then 40 * 3 (from 21-18?) Not sure.\n\nWait, another approach. Let's try combining 40 and 37 first. 40 + 37 = 77. Then we have 21 and 24 left. 77 + 21 = 98, plus 24 is 122. Wait, that's 40 +37 +21 +24. But that sums up to 40+37=77, 77+21=98, 98+24=122. Oh! Wait, but that's just adding all of them. Let me check: 21+37=58, 40+24=64, 58+64=122. Yeah, that works. But does that use all numbers once each? Yes. So 21 +37 +40 +24 = 122. But wait, the problem says \"create an equation\" using each number once with basic operations. So adding them all together is allowed. But maybe the problem expects using operations other than just addition? Let me check the problem statement again. It says \"basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) one or multiple times\". So addition multiple times is allowed. So the equation would be 21 + 37 + 40 +24 = 122. But wait, adding all four numbers: 21+37=58, 58+40=98, 98+24=122. So that's correct. But let me verify the sum: 21+37 is 58, plus 40 is 98, plus 24 is indeed 122. So that works. So the equation is simply the sum of all four numbers. But maybe the question wants some combination of operations, but according to the rules, adding them all is acceptable. Let me check the example given: (1 + 2)/3. So they use multiple operations. But the problem doesn't require using all operations, just any combination. So in this case, the simplest solution is to add all numbers. Let me confirm that 21+37+40+24 equals 122. Yes. So that's the answer. But wait, let me make sure I didn't miss any other possible combination that uses other operations. For example, maybe multiplication could lead to a more complex equation. Let's think. Suppose I use 40 * 3. How to get 3? 24 - 21 = 3. Then 40*(24-21) = 40*3=120. Then add 37? 120 +37=157, which is too high. Or subtract 37? 120-37=83. Not helpful. Alternatively, 37*3=111, plus 21=132, which is over. Hmm. Alternatively, 40*(something) plus something else. Let's see 40 * 24 = 960. That's way too big. 37*24=888. Also too big. Maybe division. Let's try 40 / (something). Like 40/(21-24/ something). Wait, 24 divided by something. Maybe 24 divided by (37-21). 37-21=16. 24/16=1.5. Then 40 /1.5=26.666..., which isn't helpful. Alternatively, 37 - (40/ (24 -21)). 24-21=3. 40/3≈13.333. 37-13.333≈23.666. Then add 21? 23.666+21≈44.666. Not helpful. Hmm. Another approach: 37* (something) plus or minus others. 37*3=111, then add 11. But how to get 11 from 40, 24, 21. 40-24=16, 16-21= -5. Not helpful. Alternatively, 24 - (40/ (37-21)). Let's see 37-21=16. 40/16=2.5. 24 -2.5=21.5. Then 21.5 + something. Not sure. Maybe that's not the way. Let's think about the initial approach. The straightforward sum works. So 21 +37 +40 +24=122. That's correct. So maybe the answer is just that. Let me check once more. 21+37=58. 58+40=98. 98+24=122. Yes. So even though it's just addition, it's allowed. Therefore, the equation is 21+37+40+24=122.\n</think>\n\n<answer>21 + 37 + 40 + 24 = 122</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using all the numbers 56, 35, 891, and 81 exactly once, with basic arithmetic operations, and the result should be 789. Hmm. Let's start by thinking about how these numbers can combine to get close to 789.\n\nFirst, 891 is the largest number here. Maybe I can subtract something from 891 to get close to 789. Let's calculate 891 minus 789. That gives 102. So if I can make 102 using the remaining numbers 56, 35, and 81, that would work. But how?\n\nWait, 56 and 35. Let me check 56 + 35 = 91. Then 81 is left. 91 + 81 = 172, which is too big. 81 - 56 would be 25, but then 25 + 35 = 60. Still not 102. Hmm. Maybe multiply? 35 * 81 is way too big. 56 * 35 = 1960. No, that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 81 - 35 = 46. Then 56 + 46 = 102. Wait, that's 102! So 56 + (81 - 35) = 56 + 46 = 102. Then 891 - 102 = 789. Let me check:\n\n891 - (56 + (81 - 35)) = 891 - (56 + 46) = 891 - 102 = 789. Yes! That works. Let's make sure all numbers are used once: 891, 56, 81, 35. Yep, all used. Operations are subtraction, addition, and subtraction. So the equation is 891 - (56 + (81 - 35)) = 789. \n\nAlternatively, writing it as 891 - 56 - 81 + 35. Wait, let's compute that: 891 -56 is 835, then 835 -81 is 754, then 754 +35=789. Oh, that's another way. So 891 -56 -81 +35. That uses all numbers once. Let me check the arithmetic again:\n\n891 -56 = 835\n\n835 -81 = 754\n\n754 +35 = 789. Yes, correct. So that equation is 891 -56 -81 +35 =789. \n\nBut wait, in this case, the order of operations isn't an issue because subtraction and addition are left associative. So parentheses aren't necessary, but maybe the problem expects explicit grouping. But according to the example given in the problem, like (1+2)/3, perhaps the user expects parentheses. Let me think. The first approach uses parentheses: 891 - (56 + (81 -35)). Alternatively, the second approach can be written as 891 -56 -81 +35. But does that require parentheses? No, because subtraction is left-associative. So 891 -56 -81 +35 is evaluated as ((891 -56) -81) +35. Which gives the same result. So maybe both forms are acceptable. However, the user might prefer a minimal use of parentheses. \n\nBut let me verify if all numbers are used once. 891, 56, 81, 35. Yes, all four numbers are used. So either equation works. The first one uses parentheses, the second doesn't. However, the problem statement says \"you can use the numbers one or multiple times but each number can only be used once\". Wait, no, the original instruction says \"each number can only be used once, and you must use all the numbers\". So both approaches use each number once. \n\nBut let's check the second approach again: 891 -56 -81 +35. That's using 891, 56, 81, and 35. So yes. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another combination. Let's see if there's another way. For example, using multiplication. Let's think: 56 * 35 is 1960. That's way too big. 891 divided by something. 891 /81 is 11. Then 11 * 56 = 616. 616 +35=651. Not 789. Alternatively, 891 - (81/56)*35. Let's calculate 81/56 is approximately 1.446. Multiply by 35 gives 50.625. 891 -50.625 is 840.375. Not 789. \n\nAnother approach: 35 * (81 -56) = 35*25=875. Then 891 -875=16. Then 16 + ... but we have already used all numbers. So no. \n\nAlternatively, 891 - (81 - (56/35)). Let's compute 56/35=1.6. 81 -1.6=79.4. 891-79.4=811.6. Not helpful. \n\nHmm. What about adding 891 and 81? That's 972. Then subtract 56 and 35: 972 -56=916, 916-35=881. Not 789. \n\nAlternatively, 891 + 35 = 926. 926 -81=845. 845 -56=789. Wait, that works! Let me check:\n\n891 +35 =926\n\n926 -81=845\n\n845 -56=789. So that's 891 +35 -81 -56 =789. So all numbers are used once. The equation is 891 +35 -81 -56=789. Let me compute that again step by step: 891 +35 is 926, minus 81 is 845, minus 56 is 789. Correct. So that's another valid equation. \n\nSo that's a simpler equation. Let me check if all numbers are used once: 891, 35, 81, 56. Yes. So this equation is 891 +35 -81 -56=789. \n\nIs there a way to make this with multiplication or division? Let me see. For instance, 56*(35 - (891/81)). Let's compute 891 divided by 81 is 11. 35-11=24. 56*24=1344. Not 789. \n\nOr maybe (891 -81)/(56/35). Let's see: 56/35=1.6. 891-81=810. 810/1.6=506.25. Not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, 891 - (81/(56/35)). Let's compute 56/35=1.6, 81/1.6=50.625. 891-50.625=840.375. Nope. \n\nSo the earlier approaches using addition and subtraction seem more promising. So either 891 -56 -81 +35 or 891 +35 -81 -56. Both are valid. The first equation I thought of was 891 - (56 +81 -35). Which is the same as 891 -56 -81 +35. \n\nSo perhaps the simplest way is to write 891 +35 -81 -56=789. Since all operations are in a straight line. Let me verify again:\n\nStart with 891. Add 35: 891 +35=926. Subtract 81: 926-81=845. Subtract 56: 845-56=789. Correct. \n\nYes, this works. So the equation is 891 +35 -81 -56=789. \n\nAlternatively, the problem might require parentheses, but since addition and subtraction are left associative, parentheses aren't necessary. But in the example given, they used parentheses. However, the example used division and addition, which have different precedence. In our case, all operations are addition and subtraction, so parentheses aren't needed. \n\nBut to be safe, maybe the user expects the equation written without ambiguity. So perhaps 891 + 35 - 81 - 56 is sufficient. Let me check if the problem allows multiple uses of the same operation. Since the problem says \"basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) one or multiple times\", yes, so using subtraction twice is allowed. \n\nTherefore, the equation is 891 +35 -81 -56=789. All numbers used once. Checks out. \n\nSo the final answer is <answer>891 + 35 - 81 - 56</answer>\n</think>\n\n<answer>891 + 35 - 81 - 56</answer>"}]}

Let's start by thinking about possible combinations.\n\nFirst, maybe I can look for pairs that can combine to get numbers close to 32. Let's see. 87 is a big number, so maybe I need to subtract something from it. 87 minus 50 is 37. Then, 37 minus 23 is 14, but that's too low. Or maybe 87 minus 23 is 64, then 64 minus 50 is 14 again. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe multiply or divide. 87 divided by 23 is roughly 3.78. Then 3.78 times 18 would be about 68, which is way over. Not helpful. Hmm.\n\nWait, 50 minus 18 is 32. Oh, that's interesting. So if I can get 50 - 18 = 32, but then I still need to use 87 and 23. How can I incorporate those? Maybe combine them into an expression that cancels out or becomes zero? Like 87 - 87, but I can't reuse numbers. Wait, 87 - 23 is 64. Then maybe 64 divided by something? But I have 50 and 18 left. 64 / (50 - 18) would be 64 / 32 = 2. Not sure how that helps.\n\nWait, let's think differently. If I have 50 - 18 = 32, then perhaps the other numbers can be used in a way that when combined with this result, it still gives 32. But since all numbers must be used once, maybe we need to structure it so that 87 and 23 are part of the equation leading to 50 - 18. For example, maybe (87 - 23) / (something) + something else. Wait, 87 - 23 is 64. Then 64 divided by something. If I divide 64 by 2, that's 32. But where do I get the 2? Maybe from 50 and 18. 50 - 48 = 2, but 18* something. Wait, 18 divided by 9 is 2, but how to get 9 from the remaining numbers? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 64 - (something) =32. So 64 -32=32. So if I can get 32 from the other numbers. Wait, 50 - 18 is 32. So 64 - (50 -18) = 64 -32=32. But that would require using 50 and 18 again, but they can only be used once. So that approach might not work.\n\nWait, maybe (87 - 23) - (50 -18) = 64 -32=32. But that uses all four numbers: 87,23,50,18. Let me check: 87-23=64, 50-18=32. Then 64-32=32. So yes! That works. All numbers are used once, each operation is basic. So the equation is (87 - 23) - (50 - 18) = 32. Let me verify:\n\n87 minus 23 is 64. Then 50 minus 18 is 32. 64 minus 32 is indeed 32. Yes! That works. So the equation is (87 - 23) - (50 - 18) =32. So I can write that as the answer.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(87 - 23) - (50 - 18) = 32</answer>"}]}

Hmm. Let me start by thinking about the target number, 218. It's a bit less than 220, so maybe subtracting something from a larger number?\n\nFirst, I should check the larger numbers. 844 and 630 are the big ones. Let me see if I can combine them in some way. 844 minus 630 is 214. That's close to 218, but 4 off. Wait, 214 + 4 = 218. But I have 1 and 3 left. How can I make 4 from 1 and 3? 3 + 1 is 4. Oh, wait! So maybe 844 - 630 + (3 + 1) = 214 + 4 = 218. But does that use all numbers? Let's check: 844, 630, 3, 1. Yes, each used once. So that would work. But let me make sure about the operations. The equation would be (844 - 630) + (3 + 1) = 218. Or maybe 844 - 630 + 3 + 1. Since addition and subtraction are left to right, but parentheses might not be necessary. Let me calculate:\n\n844 - 630 is 214. Then 214 +3 is 217, plus 1 is 218. Wait, no. Wait, if I do 844 - 630 + 3 + 1, that's 214 + 3 +1 = 218. Yes. But does the order matter here? Because addition and subtraction are left associative. So yes, 844 - 630 is 214, plus 3 is 217, plus 1 is 218. So that works. But does that use all the numbers? Let's see: 844, 630, 3, 1. Yes. Each exactly once. So the equation would be 844 - 630 + 3 + 1 = 218. But wait, the problem requires using each number once, so that uses all of them. So that's a possible solution.\n\nBut let me check if that's allowed. The operations are + and -, and each number is used once. That seems valid. Alternatively, maybe there's another way, but this seems straightforward. Let me double-check the arithmetic. 844 minus 630: 630 is 600, so 844-600=244, minus 30 more is 214. Then adding 3 gives 217, then plus 1 is 218. Correct. So this works.\n\nBut maybe the problem expects grouping operations, but as per the example, the answer could be something like (844 - 630) + 3 +1. But since addition is commutative, the parentheses around 844-630 may not be necessary. Alternatively, maybe the problem requires parentheses to make the order explicit. Let me check if there's any other possible way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using multiplication or division. Let's see. For example, 630 divided by 3 is 210. Then, 844 - (630 / 3) -1 = 844 - 210 -1 = 633. That's way too big. Not helpful.\n\nOr 844 divided by something. 844 / 4 is 211, but 4 isn't directly available. Wait, but I have 1 and 3. Can I make 4 using 3 and 1? 3 +1 is 4. So 844 / (3 +1) = 211. Then 211 - (630 / something). Wait, but 630 is another number. Hmm. 211 minus 630 is negative. Not helpful. Or maybe 211 plus something. But 630 needs to be used. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, 844 - (630 / (3 +1)). Let's see: 3+1 is 4, so 630/4 is 157.5. Then 844 - 157.5 is 686.5. Not 218.\n\nHmm. Another approach: 630 - (something) = 218. Let's see. 630 - x = 218. So x = 630 -218 = 412. Can I make 412 from 844, 1, 3? 844 divided by 2 is 422, but I don't have 2. 844 - 432 = 412, but 432 would need to be made from 1 and 3. Not obvious. Maybe 844/(3-1) = 422, which is not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe using multiplication. Let's see. 3 * something. 3 times 73.333 is 220, but not sure. Alternatively, 3 * 70 is 210. Close to 218. But how to get 70 from 844 and 630? Not sure.\n\nAnother idea: 630 divided by 3 is 210. 210 plus 8 is 218. Where does 8 come from? 844 minus 836 is 8, but 836 would need to be made from... Hmm. 844 - (something) =8. But that seems forced. Alternatively, 844 minus 836 =8. But 836 is 630 + 206, but I don't have 206. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 844 divided by something. Let's see. If 844 divided by 4 is 211, then 211 plus 7 is 218. 7 from 1 and 3? 3*2 +1=7, but no 2. Hmm. Not possible.\n\nWait, maybe 630 divided by (3 -1) = 315. Then 844 minus 315 = 529. Not helpful. 529 is way off.\n\nAlternatively, 844 - (630 + 3) = 844 - 633 = 211. Then 211 + 7 = 218, but 7 from where? We already used 630, 3, and 844. Only 1 left. Can't make 7 from 1. So no.\n\nAnother angle: 3* (something) = 218. 218 divided by 3 is about 72.666. Not sure. How to get that from the other numbers. 630 and 844. Maybe 844 - 630 = 214. 214 divided by 3 is around 71.333. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 844 - (630 - (3*1)) = 844 - 627 = 217. Close, but 217 is 1 less than 218. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe 844 - (630 / 3) +1. Let's see: 630 /3 is 210. 844 -210 is 634. 634 +1 is 635. No.\n\nHmm. Let's go back to the initial idea. The first solution I thought of was 844 -630 +3 +1 =218. That uses all numbers once. Let me confirm again:\n\n844 -630 = 214.\n\n214 +3 =217.\n\n217 +1=218.\n\nYes, correct. So that equation would be 844 - 630 + 3 + 1 =218. But the problem says you can use the operations one or multiple times. So using subtraction once and addition twice. That's allowed. Each number is used once.\n\nBut maybe the problem expects the numbers to be used in a different order, but I think this is acceptable. Let me check if there's any other possible way, but this seems straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using multiplication. Let's see: 3 * (something) = 218. 218 divided by3 is about 72.666. If I could make that from 630 and 844. But not sure.\n\nWait, 630 - 844 = negative number. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, (844 - 630) * (3 -1) = 214 *2=428. Not helpful.\n\nOr (844 - (630 +1 )) /3. Let's calculate: 630+1=631. 844-631=213. 213/3=71. No.\n\nHmm. Another approach: 3! is 6, but can we use factorial? The problem says basic operations: +, -, *, /. So no factorial. So that's out.\n\nWait, perhaps 630 /3 =210. 210 + (844 - 1) is 210 +843=1053. No.\n\nAlternatively, 630 - (844 / (3 +1)). Let's compute: 3+1=4. 844/4=211. 630 -211=419. Not 218.\n\nAlternatively, 844/(3) = 281.333. Then 281.333 -630 +1. That's way negative. Not helpful.\n\nAnother angle: 218 is 220 - 2. So maybe 220 -2. How to get 220 from 630 and 844? 630 is divisible by 10 (630/10=63), but not sure. 844 divided by 4 is 211. 211 + something. Hmm. Not helpful.\n\nWait, 3*70=210. 210 +8=218. How to get 8? 844 - (630 + ...). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, 844 - (630 - (3*1)) = 844 - (630-3)=844-627=217. Close to 218. But again, off by 1. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe using division. Let me try 630 divided by something. 630 /3=210. Then 210 + (844 -1)=210+843=1053. No. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, (844 - (630 /3)) -1 = 844-210=634 -1=633. No.\n\nAnother idea: 844 - (630 -1)/3. Let's see: 630-1=629. 629/3≈209.666. 844-209.666≈634.333. Not helpful.\n\nHmm. Maybe I should stick with the first solution. It works and uses all numbers once. Let me check once again.\n\nNumbers used: 844, 630,3,1. All used. Operations: -, +, +. Yes. The equation is 844 -630 +3 +1=218. Correct.

Let me start by thinking about how these numbers can combine.\n\nFirst, let me list out the numbers: 44, 61, 88, 1. I need to use all of them. The target is 122. Hmm. Let me see possible combinations.\n\nLooking at the numbers, 88 is a big number. Maybe subtract something from 88 to get close? 88 plus something else? Let's see. 88 + 44 would be 132, which is over. 88 + 61 is 149, way over. 88 + 1 is 89, not enough. So maybe subtraction. 88 - 44 is 44. That's too low. 88 - 61 is 27. Not helpful. 88 -1 is 87. Still not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe multiply some numbers. 44 * 1 is 44. 61 * 1 is 61. 88 * 1 is 88. Not sure. What if I do 88 + 61? That's 149. Then subtract something. 149 - 44 = 105. Then add 1, 106. Not enough. Or 149 - (44 +1) = 104. Still not.\n\nWait, 61 and 44. 61 + 44 is 105. Then add 88? No, that's way over. Maybe 61 * something. 61 * 2 is 122. Oh, that's the target. So how to get 2 from 88 and 44 and 1. Wait, 88 divided by 44 is 2. Then 61 * (88 /44) = 61 *2 =122. But then I have to use the 1 as well. Since all numbers must be used. So that's a problem. Because in this case, we used 61,88,44, but not 1. So need to incorporate the 1 somehow.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use 88 + 44. 88 +44 =132. Then 132 - (61 -1). 61-1 is 60. 132 -60=72. Not enough. Hmm. Or 132 -61 +1=72. No.\n\nWhat if I do 61 - (88 /44) +1? Let's compute that. 88 divided by 44 is 2. So 61 -2 +1=60. Not 122. Maybe the other way. 61 + (88/44) +1. That's 61+2+1=64. No.\n\nWait, perhaps (88 + 44) - (61 -1). So 132 -60=72. No. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 44* (something). Let's see. 44*2=88. But that might not help. Wait, maybe 61 + (88 -44) +1. 88-44=44. 61+44=105. 105+1=106. No.\n\nAnother approach: Let's think of 122 as a combination of 61 and the others. Since 61 is half of 122. So 61*2=122. So if I can get 2 from 88,44,1. 88 divided by 44 is 2. Then 61*(88/44)=122. But again, where does the 1 come in? I need to use all numbers. So maybe 61*(88/(44-1)). Let's check: 44-1=43. 88/43 is approximately 2.0465. 61* that is about 124.7, which is not 122.\n\nAlternatively, (61 +1) * (something). 62*something. 62*2=124, which is close. Let's see. 88 -44=44. 44/44=1. Not helpful. Hmm.\n\nWait, 88 divided by (44/1). That's 88/(44/1)=88/44=2. Then 61*2=122. So that's 61*(88/(44/1)). Let's check: 44 divided by 1 is 44. 88 divided by 44 is 2. 61*2=122. And all numbers are used: 61,88,44,1. Yes! That works. So the equation would be 61 * (88 / (44 / 1)) = 122. Let me verify:\n\nFirst, compute the inner division: 44 / 1 = 44. Then 88 / 44 = 2. Then 61 * 2 = 122. Perfect. All numbers are used once.

Let's start by thinking about how to reach 440. Since 440 is a relatively large number, multiplication might be necessary here. Let me see the possible combinations.\n\nFirst, let's look at the numbers given: 48, 22, 62, 25. Let's see if any pair can multiply to get close to 440. For example, 48 multiplied by 9.166... is 440, but 9.166 isn't one of the numbers. Alternatively, 22 times 20 is 440. Hmm, 20 isn't directly available, but maybe we can create 20 using the remaining numbers. Let's check: 62 minus 25 is 37, and 48 divided by something... Wait, maybe another approach.\n\nAlternatively, 25 multiplied by 17.6 is 440. How to get 17.6 from the other numbers. 48 divided by 22 is approximately 2.18, then add 62? No, that's too high. Maybe subtract. Let's see, 62 - (48/22) would be around 62 - 2.18 ≈ 59.82, which multiplied by 25 is way over. Not helpful.\n\nWait, 48 times 22 is 1056. If I subtract something from that. 1056 minus 62 would be 994, which is still way over 440. Maybe divide. 1056 divided by something. If I use 25, 1056 /25 is 42.24, which isn't helpful.\n\nAnother angle: 62 and 22. 62 times 22 is 1364. That's way too big. Maybe subtract 25 and 48? Let's see: 1364 - 48 -25 = 1291. Still too big.\n\nWait, perhaps combine numbers in a different way. Let's see, 48 and 25. 48 *25 is 1200. If I can subtract 760 from that, I get 440. How to get 760 from 62 and 22? 62 times 12.258... Not helpful. 62*12 is 744, which is close but not 760. Alternatively, 62*22 is 1364, which is way over.\n\nAlternatively, 62 -22 = 40. Then 40 times something. 40*11=440. But how to get 11 from 48 and 25. Maybe 48 - 25 =23. Not 11. 25 - (48/ something). 48 divided by 4 is 12, but I don't have a 4. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe divide 48 by 22 first. 48/22 = 24/11 ≈2.18. Then multiply by 62? 24/11 *62 ≈ (24*62)/11 ≈1488/11≈135.27. Then multiply by 25? That's way over. No.\n\nAlternatively, 25*62 = 1550. Then subtract 48 and 22. 1550 -48 -22= 1480. Still too high. If I can divide by something. But not sure.\n\nWait another approach: Let's think about the factors of 440. 440 = 44*10, 11*40, 8*55, etc. Let's see if I can get 44 and 10 from the numbers. For example, 22*2 is 44, but how to get 2 from the remaining numbers. 62- (48+25) = 62-73= -11. Not helpful. Alternatively, 48 -25=23, 62-23=39. Not helpful.\n\nWait, 440 divided by 25 is 17.6. Maybe that's a clue. So if I can make 17.6 from 48, 22, 62. Let's see: 48 divided by (22 - (62/ something)). Hmm, not sure. Let's try:\n\n48 divided by 22 is about 2.18. Then 62 - 2.18 is 59.82. Multiply by 25? 59.82 *25≈1495.5. Not 440.\n\nWait, perhaps 62 - (48 / (25 -22)). Let's compute that. 25-22=3. Then 48/3=16. Then 62 -16=46. Then 46* something? But we've used 48,22,25,62 already. Wait, no. Wait, in this case, used 48, 22, 25, and 62. But wait, the expression would be (62 - (48/(25-22))) = 62 -16=46. Then multiply by what? But all numbers are already used. Because 25-22 uses 25 and 22, then 48 divided by that, then subtracted from 62. Then that gives 46, but how to reach 440 with 46? But all numbers are already used. So this approach might not work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (48 +22) * something. 70 * something. 70*6.285≈440. 70*6.285=440. But how to get 6.285. Maybe 62 divided by 25 is 2.48. Then 62/25 + something. Not helpful.\n\nWait, let's try multiplying two pairs and then adding. For example: 48*22=1056, 62*25=1550. Then 1056 +1550=2606. Not helpful. Or subtracting: 1550-1056=494. Close to 440 but not there. Maybe 48*25=1200, 62*22=1364. 1364-1200=164. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 62* (25 - (48/22)). Let's compute that: 48/22≈2.1818. 25-2.1818≈22.818. 62*22.818≈1415.7. Not 440.\n\nWait, another idea. Maybe 22*(something) =440. 440 divided by 22 is 20. So if we can create 20 using 48, 62, 25. How? Let's see. 62 -48=14. 14 + (25- something). 25-14=11. Not helpful. Or 48/(62-25)=48/37≈1.297. Then 1.297*25≈32.43. Not 20.\n\nWait, 25 - (62-48) =25-14=11. Then 22*11=242. Not 440. Alternatively, (62 - (48/ something)) *22. For example, 62 - (48/25)=62 -1.92=60.08. Then 60.08*22≈1321.76. Too high.\n\nWait, maybe 25* (something). 25*17.6=440. So how to get 17.6 from 48,22,62. Let's see. 48/(62-22)=48/40=1.2. Then 1.2 + something? Not sure. 62-22=40. 40*11=440. So maybe 25 + (48/ something) to get 40. Wait, 48 divided by 1.2 is 40. So 48 divided by (25-22)=48/3=16. Then 16 + something? 16+24=40, but where to get 24 from. 62-22=40. Hmm, not quite.\n\nAlternatively, (48 * 25) - (62 +22). Let's compute that: 1200 -84=1116. Not 440. No.\n\nHmm. Let's try a different approach. Maybe use division in a way to reduce a larger number. For example, 62 * (48 -22) =62*26=1612. Then divide by something. 1612/25≈64.48. Not helpful.\n\nWait, 48*(62-22)=48*40=1920. Then 1920/ (25 - something). Wait, 25-? We have used 48,62,22 already. So 25 is left. So 1920/25=76.8. No.\n\nAnother angle: 25*22=550. 550 is higher than 440. If I subtract 110 from 550, I get 440. How to get 110 from 48 and 62. 62+48=110. Perfect! So the equation would be (25*22) - (62 +48) = 550 -110=440. Let's check if all numbers are used once: 25,22,62,48. Yes. All used. So that works. Wait, let me verify:\n\n25 *22 = 550.\n\n62 +48=110.\n\n550 -110=440. Correct.\n\nYes! That works. So the equation is (25 × 22) - (62 +48) =440. Let me double-check the arithmetic:\n\n25*22: 25*20=500, 25*2=50, total 550.\n\n62+48=110.\n\n550-110=440. Perfect. And all numbers are used once. So this should be the correct equation.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(25 * 22) - (62 + 48) = 440</answer>"}]}

Wait, but maybe using subtraction or division to adjust.\n\nAlternatively, 71 times 12 is 852, which is close. Hmm. 71 times 12.056 would be 856, but again, not helpful. Maybe 71 times 12 plus something. Wait, but 12 isn't one of our numbers. Let me think differently.\n\nWhat if I combine two numbers through multiplication and then add or subtract another product? Let's try combinations:\n\n76 and 71 are the two larger numbers. 76*71 = 5396, which is way too big. Maybe subtract something. 5396 minus (13*9) = 5396 - 117 = 5279. No, that's not helpful. Maybe division? 5396 divided by something. 5396 / 13 is approximately 415.07, which isn't helpful. 5396 / 9 is around 599.55. Not helpful.\n\nWhat about using 76 and 13? 76*13=988. Then subtract something. 988 - 71 = 917, then minus 9 is 908. Still not 856. Maybe 76*13 is 988. If I subtract 71+9=80, that's 988-80=908. Still not.\n\nWait, 71 multiplied by 12 is 852, as I thought before. How can I get 12 from the remaining numbers? 9 and 13 and 76. Let's see. 76 divided by 13 is approximately 5.846. Not 12. Alternatively, 13 - (9 / something). Maybe 13 - (9 / something) to get 12. But 9 divided by 1 is 9, so 13 - 9 =4. Not helpful. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 13 - (76 / 71) but that's complicated. Let's try different combinations.\n\nWait, 856 divided by 9 is approximately 95.11. Maybe 95.11 is achievable with other numbers. Let's see. 76 + 13 + 71 = 160. No. 76 + (13*71) = 76 + 923 = 999. Not helpful. Maybe subtract. 76*13 =988. 988 - 71 = 917. 917 -9=908. Not helpful.\n\nWait, let me think of 76* (something). 76*11 is 836. 836 is close to 856. Then 836 +20=856. How to get 20 from 13,9,71. But 71-13=58, 58-9=49. Not 20. Alternatively, 71/(something). 71/3.55 is 20, but not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 76* (13 - (9)) =76*(4)=304. Not helpful. 76* (13 +9)=76*22=1672. That's way over.\n\nWait, 71*13=923. Then 923 - 76=847. 847 +9=856. Wait, that's 71*13 -76 +9. Let me check:\n\n71*13=923. 923-76=847. 847+9=856. Yes! Let me verify:\n\n71 *13 is indeed 923. Then subtract 76 gives 847. Add 9 gives 856. So the equation is 71*13 -76 +9. But wait, do I need to use parentheses? Let's see the order of operations. Multiplication comes first, so 71*13 is done first, then subtract 76, then add 9. So the equation would be 71*13 -76 +9. But let me check if all numbers are used once: 71,13,76,9. Yes, all four numbers are used once. So that works. Let me confirm the calculation again:\n\n71 *13 = 923\n\n923 -76 = 847\n\n847 +9 =856. Exactly. So the equation is 71*13 -76 +9. Therefore, the answer is (71 * 13) - 76 + 9. But according to the problem's example, they used parentheses even when not necessary, maybe to clarify. Alternatively, it's 71*13 -76 +9, but parentheses aren't needed. But to make it clear, perhaps (71 *13) -76 +9.\n</think>\n\n<answer>71 * 13 - 76 + 9</answer>"}]}

Let me try this: (12 - (56 / 14)) = 12 - 4 = 8. Then 66 * 8 = 528, not enough. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (66 + 12) * something. 66 +12 is 78. 78 times 7.615 is 594, but again not helpful.

Let's see, 56 *12 is 672. 2772 / 672 is about 4.125. No, not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe subtract something. 66 * 12 is 792. 56 * 42 is 2352. 2352 - 792 is 1560, which is way over. Hmm. Not helpful.\n\nWait, what if I do (66 - 12) * (56 - 42). Let's compute that: 54 *14 = 756. Not 594. Still not there.\n\nAlternatively, 56 * 66 = 3696. Then divide by something. 3696 divided by 42 is 88. Then 88 times 12 is 1056. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe combining division and multiplication. Let me try 66 * (42 / (56 - 12)). Let's compute denominator first: 56-12=44. 42/44 is 0.9545. 66 *0.9545≈63, not close.\n\nAlternatively, 42 * 12 = 504. Then 504 + 56 +66=626. No. 504 + (66 -56)=504+10=514. Not 594.\n\nHmm, maybe 66*9=594. So how to get 9 from 56,42,12. Let's see: 12 - (56 -42) = 12 -14= -2. Not helpful. 56/(42/12). Let's compute that: 42 divided by 12 is 3.5. 56 divided by 3.5 is 16. Then 66*16=1056. No. Alternatively, (56 +42)/12 = 98/12≈8.166. 66*8.166≈539, close but not 594.\n\nWait, maybe 56 *12 =672. Then 672 - (66 +42)=672-108=564. Not enough.\n\nWait another approach: 594 is 66 times 9. So 9 can be made from 12, 56, 42. Let me see. 12 - (56 -42) = 12-14= -2. Not good. Alternatively, (56 +42)/12=98/12≈8.166. Then 8.166 + something? No. Alternatively, (56/ (42/12))? Let's compute denominator first:42/12=3.5. Then 56/3.5=16. So 16, then 66*16=1056. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 56 - (42/12)=56 -3.5=52.5. 66*52.5=3465. No. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps using a combination of multiplication and addition. Let's see, 66*12=792. Then 56*42=2352. If I subtract 2352-792=1560, which is way off. Maybe 792 - (something). Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 42*12=504. Then 504 + 56 +66=626. No. 504 + (66-56)=504+10=514. No.\n\nWait, maybe (56 +42) * (66 /12). Let's compute: 56+42=98. 66/12=5.5. 98*5.5=539. Close but not 594. 539 is 55 less than 594. Hmm.\n\nWait, 56*10.607=594. But how to get 10.607. Maybe (66 +42)/12=108/12=9. Then 56*9=504. 504 is less than 594. Then 504 + (66 -42)=504+24=528. Still not 594. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe 66 * ( (56 - 42) +12 ). Let's compute: 56-42=14. 14+12=26. 66*26=1716. No, too big.\n\nAlternatively, (66 * (56 -42)) -12. So 66*14=924. 924-12=912. Not 594.\n\nWait, 66*(56/ (42-12)). Let's compute denominator:42-12=30. 56/30≈1.866. 66*1.866≈123. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe (66 - (56/42)) *12. Let's compute:56/42≈1.333. 66-1.333≈64.666. 64.666*12≈776. Not 594.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Maybe I need to use division and multiplication together. Let's try (66 * 42) / (56 -12). Compute denominator:56-12=44. 66*42=2772. 2772/44=63. Not 594.\n\nWait, 66 * (42 / (56/12)). Let's compute 56/12≈4.666. Then 42 divided by 4.666≈9. So 66*9=594. Oh! Wait, that works. Let me check that again.\n\nSo 56 divided by 12 is 56/12=14/3≈4.6667. Then 42 divided by (14/3) is 42*(3/14)=9. So 42/(56/12) =42*(12/56)= (42*12)/56=504/56=9. Then 66*9=594. So putting it all together: 66 * (42 / (56 /12)) =594. Let me verify:\n\nFirst, compute 56 divided by 12: 56/12=14/3.\n\nThen, 42 divided by (14/3): 42/(14/3)=42*(3/14)= (42/14)*3=3*3=9.\n\nMultiply by 66: 66*9=594. Yes! That works. So the equation is 66 × (42 ÷ (56 ÷ 12)) =594. Let me check if all numbers are used once: 66,42,56,12. Yes, all used once. Operations are division and multiplication. So the equation is 66*(42/(56/12))=594. Let me write that with parentheses properly: 66 * (42 / (56 / 12)). That should be correct.\n</think>\n\n<answer>66 * (42 / (56 / 12))</answer>"}]}

So maybe combine them in different ways. Let's think about the target number, 90. It's a multiple of 15, since 15*6=90. Also, 72 is a big number. Maybe 72 plus something? Let's see: 72 + 12 = 84, which is less than 90. Then adding 15 would be 99, but that's over. Hmm. Alternatively, 72 multiplied by something. 72*1 is 72, then adding 15 and 12 gives 99 again. No.\n\nWait, maybe subtract something from 72. 72 - (something) to get part of it. But not sure. Let's think of combining the smaller numbers. 12 and 15 can be combined. 12 + 15 = 27, but 27*1=27. 72 + 27 = 99 again. Not helpful. Alternatively, 15 -12 =3, then 3*1=3. 72*3=216, way too big. Hmm.\n\nWhat if I use division? Let's see. 12 divided by 1 is 12. Then 72 + 12 =84, plus 15 is 99. Not good. Maybe 72 divided by something. 72 divided by 12 is 6. Then 6 times 15 is 90, but then where does the 1 come in? Because I have to use all numbers. Wait, 72 / 12 = 6, then 6 * 15 =90, but the 1 isn't used. So that's a problem. Because I need to use all four numbers. So maybe that's a path but need to include the 1 somehow.\n\nAlternatively, 15 divided by 1 is 15. Then 72 + 15 =87, plus 12 is 99 again. No. Hmm. What if I multiply 12 and 15? 12*15=180. Then maybe 180 divided by something. If I use 72, 180/72=2.5, but that's not helpful. Or 180 divided by 2 (but I don't have a 2). Wait, but I have 1. 180 divided by (72 - something)? Let me see. Maybe 12*15=180, then subtract 72*1=72. 180-72=108. Not 90. No.\n\nWait, maybe 72 - (15 -12)/1. Let's compute that: 15-12=3, divided by 1 is 3. So 72 -3=69. Not 90. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 72 + (15 -12) *1. That would be 72 +3=75. Still not 90.\n\nWhat if I do (72 -12) * (15 /1). So 60 *15=900. Way too big. No.\n\nWait, maybe (15 + 1) * something. 16 multiplied by, let's see, 72 divided by 12 is 6. 16*6=96. Close, but not 90. Or 15 -1=14. 14* (72/12)=14*6=84. Still not.\n\nHmm. Let me think of another approach. Maybe use subtraction and multiplication. For example, 72 multiplied by 1 is 72. Then add 12 and 15: 72 +12 +15=99. No. If I can find a way to subtract something. Maybe 72*(15 -12) +1. 72*(3)+1=217. No. Not helpful.\n\nWait, 15*12=180. Then divide by 2, but I don't have 2. But I have 72 and 1. 180 divided by (72/1) would be 180/72=2.5. No. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 72 + (15 - (12 /1)). That's 15 -12=3, so 72+3=75. Still no.\n\nWait, maybe 12/(1/15) is 12*15=180. Then 180 -72=108. No. Not 90.\n\nHmm. Maybe a different combination. Let's see: 72 + something. If I can make 18 from the other numbers. 12 +15 +1=28. No. 15 + (12/1)=27. 72 +27=99. Not good.\n\nWait, perhaps 72 + (15 * (12 /1)). That's 15*12=180, 72+180=252. No. Not.\n\nAlternatively, 72 * (15 -12) /1. 72*3=216. No.\n\nWait, let's think of 90 as 15*6. How to get 6? 12 divided by 2, but no 2. Wait, 72 divided by 12 is 6. So 15 * (72/12) =15*6=90. That uses 15,72,12. Then where does 1 come in? Because we need to use all numbers. So maybe 15*(72/(12*1))=15*(72/12)=15*6=90. Yes! Because 12*1 is 12, then 72 divided by that is 6, multiplied by 15 gives 90. So that uses all numbers: 72,12,1,15. Let me check: 72 divided by (12*1) is 72/12=6, then 15*6=90. Yes. So the equation is 15 * (72 / (12 * 1)) = 90. That works. Let me verify each number is used once: 15,72,12,1. All used. Yes.

I need to use all the numbers 78, 1, 81, and 12 exactly once each with basic operations to get 894. Hmm. Let's start by thinking about the target number. 894 is a pretty large number, so maybe multiplication is involved here. Let me check the possible products.\n\nFirst, looking at the larger numbers: 81 and 78. If I multiply those two, 81 * 78. Let's calculate that. 80*78 is 6240, and 1*78 is 78, so total is 6240 + 78 = 6318. That's way too big. Hmm. Maybe that's not the right approach.\n\nWhat if I subtract something from that product? Wait, 6318 minus what? The other numbers are 12 and 1. 6318 - 12 - 1 = 6305, still way too high. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe combining 81 and 12 first. 81 * 12 is 972. Then, 78 - 1 = 77. 972 - 77 is 895. Oh, that's close to 894. But we need exactly 894. Hmm, maybe there's a way to adjust that. Wait, 81*12 is 972. Then if I subtract (78 + 1) = 79, that would be 972 - 79 = 893. Still off by 1. Not quite.\n\nWait, maybe another approach. Let's see. Let's try to get closer by combining numbers differently. What if I take 78 and multiply it by 12? 78*12 is 936. Then, 936 - 81 = 855. Then add 1, that's 856. Still too low.\n\nAlternatively, 78*12 = 936. 936 + 81 = 1017. Then subtract 1 gives 1016. Not helpful.\n\nWhat if I use division? Let's see. Maybe 81 divided by something. 81/1 is 81. Then 78*12 is 936. 936 + 81 = 1017 again. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe 81 - 12 = 69. Then 69 * 78 = 5382. Then subtract 1, that's 5381. No, way too high. Not useful.\n\nAlternatively, 81 - 1 = 80. Then 80 * 12 = 960. Then 960 - 78 = 882. Still not 894. Hmm.\n\nLet me try adding and multiplying. What if I do (81 + 78) * something. 81 +78=159. Then 159 * 12=1908. Then subtract 1 gives 1907. No.\n\nWait, maybe 81 * (78 -12). Let's calculate 78-12=66. Then 81*66=5346. Then subtract 1 gives 5345. No. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 78 * (81 -12) = 78*69=5382. Then 5382 -1=5381. Still way too big.\n\nHmm. Maybe I need to use division to bring the number down. Let's think. Let's see, if I have 81*12=972. Then, 972 - (78/1)=972-78=894. Wait, that works! Wait, let me check. 81*12 is indeed 972. Then 78 divided by 1 is 78. So 972 -78 = 894. And I've used all numbers: 81, 12, 78, 1. Each once. Let me verify the operations: 81 *12 =972, 78/1=78, 972-78=894. Yes! That works. So the equation would be (81 * 12) - (78 / 1) = 894. But wait, parentheses might not be needed if order of operations is followed. Let me check: 81*12 is 972, 78/1 is 78, so 972-78=894. So the equation is 81*12 -78/1. But since division here is 78 divided by 1, which is just 78, so maybe written as 81×12 -78 -1 would that also work? Wait, no, because that would use all numbers except if you subtract 78 and then subtract 1. Wait, but in that case, numbers used would be 81,12,78,1, but the operations would be 81*12 -78 -1. Let me calculate that: 81*12=972, 972-78=894, then 894-1=893. That's 893, which is not the target. So that's wrong. But if we do 81*12 - (78/1), which is 972 -78=894. So in that case, the equation is 81×12 -78/1. Since division by 1 doesn't change the value, but we have to use all numbers. Here, 78 and 1 are both used in the division. So that's allowed. Each number used once. So that works. So the equation is 81×12 -78/1 =894. Alternatively, using parentheses for clarity: (81 * 12) - (78 / 1) =894. Yes. That's a valid equation. Let me check again: 81*12 is 972. 78 divided by 1 is 78. 972 minus 78 is 894. Correct. All numbers used once. So this should be the answer.\n</think>\n\n<answer>81*12 - 78/1 = 894</answer>"}]}

If I subtract something from 977 to get 988, but wait, 977 is less than 988, so subtraction won't work. Alternatively, adding to 977 would overshoot, but maybe combining other numbers first.\n\nLet me check the difference between 988 and 977. 988 - 977 = 11. So I need to create 11 using 22, 99, and 3. Hmm, how?\n\nLooking at 99 and 22. If I subtract 22 from 99, that's 77. Not helpful. If I divide 99 by 22, that's about 4.5. If I multiply 22 by 3, that's 66. Still not getting 11. Wait, maybe 99 divided by 3 is 33. Then 33 - 22 = 11. Oh, that works! So 99 divided by 3 is 33, minus 22 gives 11. Then add that to 977 to get 988.\n\nSo putting it all together: 977 + (99 / 3 - 22) = 988. Let me check the math. 99 divided by 3 is 33. 33 minus 22 is 11. 977 plus 11 is indeed 988.

But how can I get 49 from the other numbers? Let's see, the other numbers are 65, 445, and 78. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, 441 is also 21 squared.

Then 380 plus 78 would be 458. Then 458 minus 9 is 449. That's not helpful. Alternatively, 445 minus 78 is 367. Then 367 minus 65 is 302. Then plus 9 is 311.

But maybe that's part of the solution. If I do 445 divided by 9, which is about 49.444, and then multiply by 9 again, that would just give me back 445. Not helpful.\n\nWait, the target is 441. Let me think about possible combinations. Let's see: 78 and 65. If I subtract 65 from 78, that's 13. Not helpful. If I add them, that's 143. Then 143 times something? 143 * 3 is 429, which is close to 441. But where would I get 3? Maybe from 9 divided by 3? But I don't have a 3. Wait, 9 is a number here. So 9 divided by 3 is 3, but I can't split numbers. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 78 minus 9 is 69. Then 69 plus 65 is 134. Still not helpful.\n\nLet me think about multiplication. 65 * 9 is 585. Then 585 minus something. Let's see, 585 - 445 = 140. Then 140 + 78 = 218. Not 441.\n\nOr 9 * 78 = 702. Then 702 - 445 = 257. 257 -65 = 192. Nope.\n\nHow about 445 - (78 + 65) = 445 - 143 = 302. Then 302 * 9 = 2718. No, way too big.\n\nAlternatively, 445 divided by something. Let's try 445 / 5 = 89, but again, no 5. Wait, maybe 78 - 65 =13. Then 445 /13 is approximately 34.23. Then 34.23 *9 is around 308.07. Not useful.\n\nHmm. Maybe combine operations in a different way. Let's see:\n\nWhat if I take 78 and 9 first. 78 /9 is approximately 8.666. If I subtract that from 445, that's 445 -8.666 ≈ 436.333. Then subtract 65 would be 371.333. No.\n\nAlternatively, 445 - (78 /9) -65. Let's calculate:\n\n78 /9 ≈8.666, 445 -8.666 ≈436.333, 436.333 -65≈371.333. Still no.\n\nWhat if I multiply 9 and 78 first, then do something with the other numbers. 9*78=702. Then 702 - 445=257. Then 257 -65=192. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe (445 -65) = 380. Then 380 +78=458. Then 458 -9=449. Not 441.\n\nAnother approach: Let's see, 441 divided by 9 is 49. So if I can get 49 from 65, 445, and 78. Let's see. 445 - (65 +78) = 445 -143=302. 302 divided by something? Not 49. Alternatively, 78 - (445 /65). Let's calculate 445 divided by 65: 445 ÷65 =6.846. Then 78 -6.846≈71.153. Not 49.\n\nAlternatively, 65 +78=143. 445 -143=302. 302 divided by 6.163≈49. But I don't have 6.163. Hmm.\n\nWait, 445 divided by 5 is 89, but again, no 5. Maybe use 9 to get a 5? Like 9 - (something). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, 65 -9=56. Then 445 -56=389. Then 389 -78=311. No.\n\nWait, maybe combining 65 and 78 in a division. 78/65≈1.2. Then 445 *1.2≈534. Then 534 -9=525. Not 441.\n\nAlternatively, 65*78=5070. That's way too big. 5070 divided by 445≈11.4. Then 11.4*9≈102.6. No.\n\nHmm. Maybe (445 - 65) =380. Then 380 divided by something. 380 /78≈4.87. Then 4.87*9≈43.83. Not 441.\n\nWait, perhaps 445 divided by 5. Let me check if 5 can be formed. 9- (78/65) ≈9 -1.2≈7.8. Not 5. Alternatively, 65 divided by 13 is 5, but 13 is not present. Wait, 78 divided by 13 is 6. But again, 13 is not one of the numbers. \n\nWait, perhaps (78 -65)=13. Then 445 divided by 13 is 34.2307. Then 34.2307 multiplied by 9 is approximately 308.07. Not 441.\n\nAlternatively, 445 divided by (78 - (9))=78-9=69. So 445/69≈6.449. Then 6.449 *65≈419.2. Close to 441 but not exact. \n\nAlternatively, 65*(9) =585. Then 585 +78=663. Then 663-445=218. Not 441.\n\nWait, maybe 445 - (9 * something). 9*49=441, so 445 -4=441. So if I can get 4 from 65 and 78. Let's see: 78 -65=13. 13-9=4. Wait, but 9 is already used here. Wait, but I can't reuse numbers. So that's not possible. Because 9 is already used in 9*49, but 49 comes from where? Maybe 78 - (65 / something). Let's try 65 divided by something. 65/5=13, but again, no 5. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (445 - (65 +78)) *9. Let's compute 65+78=143. 445-143=302. 302*9=2718. No, too big.\n\nWait, maybe (78 -65) *9 =13*9=117. Then 445 -117=328. Not 441.\n\nAnother idea: 445 - (78 +65 +9)=445-152=293. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 78 * (9 - (445 /65)). Let's compute 445/65=6.846. 9-6.846≈2.153. 78*2.153≈168. Not 441.\n\nHmm. This is tricky. Let me try different combinations. Maybe a combination of multiplication and addition.\n\nWait, 9*78=702. Then 702 - (445 -65). Let's see: 445-65=380. So 702-380=322. Not 441.\n\nAlternatively, 702 -445=257. Then 257 +65=322. Still no.\n\nWait, 78*65=5070. 5070 divided by 445 is roughly 11.4. Then 11.4*9≈102.6. Not useful.\n\nAnother approach: Let's see what 441 can be broken down into. 441=49*9. So if I can get 49 from 65,445,78. How?\n\nLet me try 445 - (78*5). 78*5=390. 445-390=55. Not 49. Alternatively, 65 - (78- something). 78-16=62. 65-62=3. Not helpful.\n\nWait, 445 divided by 9 is approximately 49.444. Which is close to 49.444. If I take the integer part, maybe. But 49.444*9=445. So if I can get 49.444 from (something). But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe 445/9 ≈49.444, then multiply by 9 to get back to 445. But that's not helpful. Wait, but maybe subtract 4.444 from 445 to get 440.555, but not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe (445 - (78 -65)) * (9 /9). But 9 is used once here, and also in division. Wait, but each number can be used only once. So that's invalid.\n\nAlternatively, (78 - (445 /65)) *9. Let's compute 445/65=6.846. 78 -6.846≈71.153. 71.153*9≈640.38. Not 441.\n\nWait, another idea: 65 -9=56. Then 445 -56=389. Then 389 -78=311. No.\n\nHmm. Let's try adding some numbers. 65 + 445 = 510. Then 510 +78=588. Then 588 /9=65.333. Not 441.\n\nAlternatively, 65 +445=510. 510 -78=432. 432 -9=423. Not 441.\n\nWait, 432 is close. 432 +9=441. But I already used 9. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe 65 *9=585. 585 +445=1030. 1030 -78=952. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 445 -78=367. 367 +65=432. 432 +9=441. Oh! Wait, that works. Let's check: 445 -78 =367. Then 367 +65=432. Then 432 +9=441. But are all numbers used exactly once? 445,78,65,9. Yes, all used once. And operations are -, +, +. So the equation would be (445 -78) +65 +9 =441. Let me verify:\n\n445 -78 is 367. 367 +65=432. 432 +9=441. Yes! That works. So the equation is (445 -78 +65) +9 =441. Alternatively, written as (445 -78) +65 +9. But since addition is associative, maybe parentheses aren't needed. But to be safe, perhaps group operations.\n\nWait, the problem says you can use the operations one or multiple times but each number once. So 445 -78 +65 +9. All numbers used once, operations: -, +, +. That's acceptable.\n\nSo the equation is 445 -78 +65 +9 =441. Let me check:\n\n445 -78 =367\n\n367 +65=432\n\n432 +9=441. Correct.\n\nYes! So that's the solution.\n</think>\n\n<answer>445 - 78 + 65 + 9 = 441</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using the numbers 98, 68, 65, and 42 exactly once each, with basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) any number of times, and the result should be 780. Hmm, 780 is a pretty big number, so maybe multiplication is involved here. Let me start by thinking about how to combine these numbers to get close to 780.\n\nFirst, let's look at the largest numbers: 98, 68, and 65. If I multiply some of these together, I might get a large product. But 98 multiplied by 68 is already 6664, which is way too big. So maybe that's not the way. Alternatively, maybe combining them with addition or subtraction first before multiplying.\n\nWhat if I subtract two numbers to get a smaller number and then multiply by another? For example, 98 - 68 = 30. Then 30 * 65 = 1950. That's still too big. Then maybe divide by 42? 1950 / 42 is approximately 46.428... Not close to 780.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 98 - 65 = 33. Then 33 * 68 = 2244. Dividing by 42 would give 2244 / 42 ≈ 53.428... Still not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe I need to multiply two numbers and then add or subtract the others. Let's see: 98 * 68 = 6664. Then subtract something. If I subtract 65 and 42, that's 6664 - 65 -42 = 6557. Way too big. That's not working.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 68 * 65 = 4420. Then 4420 plus 98 minus 42 is 4420 +98=4518 -42=4476. Still way over. Hmm.\n\nWait, 780 divided by, say, 65 is 12. So maybe 65 multiplied by 12. How can I get 12 from the other numbers? 98, 68, 42. Let's see. 98 - 68 = 30. 30 - 42 = -12. That's negative. But maybe 68 - (98 - 42) = 68 -56=12? Wait, 98 -42=56. Then 68 -56=12. Then 12 *65=780. Oh! That works! Let me check:\n\nSo 68 - (98 -42) = 68 -56=12. Then 12 *65=780. Yes! So the equation would be (68 - (98 -42)) *65 = 780. Let me verify each step:\n\nFirst, calculate 98 -42: that's 56. Then subtract that from 68: 68 -56=12. Then multiply by 65: 12*65=780. Perfect. And all numbers are used once: 98,68,42,65. Exactly. So the equation is (68 - (98 - 42)) * 65 = 780. Let me just write that using all the numbers and correct order. Yep, that's it.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(68 - (98 - 42)) * 65 = 780</answer>"}]}

Hmm, let's start by thinking about possible combinations.\n\nFirst, 69 is a pretty large number. Maybe if I multiply or subtract something from it. Let's see. If I take 69 and do something with the other numbers. 220 is bigger than 69, so maybe adding or multiplying. Let me try 69 multiplied by something. But 69*2 is 138, which is not enough. 69*3 would be 207, but I don't have a 3. Wait, maybe use division to get a 3? Like 8 divided by 2 is 4, but not 3. Alternatively, 49 divided by something? 49/7 is 7, but again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 69 plus something. 69 + 49 is 118. Then we have 2 and 8 left. 118 + 2 +8 = 128, which is way too low. Not helpful. What if we subtract? 69 - 49 = 20, then 20 + 2 +8 =30. Nope. Not close.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe combine 2 and 8 first. 2*8 is 16. Then 49 and 69. Let's see, 69 + 49 is 118. Then 118 +16=134. Still not 220. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe multiply 2 and 8 first, then use that with 49. 2*8=16. Then 16*49=784. Then 784 divided by something? But we have 69 left. 784/69 is like 11.36, which doesn't help. Not 220.\n\nAlternatively, 49* something. 49*4=196. How to get 4? 8/2=4. So 49*(8/2) = 49*4=196. Then we have 69 left. 196 +69=265.

Alternatively, 8*3=24. But where do I get a 3? Maybe (69 - 49)/ (something). (69-49)=20. 20/(something). 20/ (8/2)=20/4=5. Not 3. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, 49*5=245. Then 245 -25=220. 25 from 69,2,8. 69- (8*2)=69-16=53. 53-28=25? Wait, 8*2=16. 69-16=53. Not 25. Hmm.\n\nAnother angle: Let's see what numbers we have: 69,2,8,49. 220 is the target. Let's think about 220 in terms of these numbers. 220 divided by 2 is 110. So if we can get 110 from 69,8,49. But 69+49=118, which is close. 118-8=110. So 110*2=220. Wait, that's interesting.

Not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps a different approach. Let's see. 911 is the target. Let's see if we can split the numbers into two parts. For example, (853 - x) + (y) =911, where x and y are combinations of the other numbers. Or maybe (x * y) + or - something. Let me try combinations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 853 + 87 = 940. Then 940 - something =911. 940 -911=29. So need to make 29 from 48 and 32. Hmm. 48 -32=16. 32 - (48 / something). Wait, 48 divided by 16 is 3, but 16 isn't a number here.

Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 853 - (some combination) + another combination. Let's think. 911 is 853 plus 58. So need 58. Let me try again to get 58 from 87,48,32. Wait, 87 - (48 -32) =87 -16=71. No. 87 -48=39, 39 +32=71. Not 58. How about (87 -32)=55. 55 + (48/ something). 48 divided by what? 48/32=1.5. 55 +1.5=56.5. No. 48 divided by 16 is 3, but 16 isn't here. \n\nAlternatively, 32 * (87 -48) =32*39=1248. That's way too big. Then 853 -1248 would be negative. Not helpful. \n\nWait, maybe division.

Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe combining 48 and 32 to make a smaller number. 32/48=0.666..., then 87 +0.666=87.666, then 853 -87.666≈765.333. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 48/32=1.5. Then 87 *1.5=130.5. Then 853 -130.5=722.5. Then 722.5 + something? But we already used all numbers except perhaps that's not the case. Wait, 48 and 32 are used in the division and multiplication here. But each number can only be used once. So if I use 48/32 to get 1.5, then that uses both 48 and 32. Then 87 is multiplied by 1.5, which is 130.5. Then adding 853. So 853 +130.5=983.5. Then we have all numbers used? 48,32,87,853. But 983.5 isn't 911. So that approach might not work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (853 - 87) = 766. Then use 48 and 32. Let's see: 766 + (48*32). Wait, 48*32=1536. 766+1536=2302, which is way too big. \n\nWait, maybe subtract instead. 766 - (48*32)=766-1536= -770. No. \n\nAlternatively, 853 - (87 +48)=853-135=718. Then 718 +32=750. No.\n\nHmm. Maybe I need to think of multiplication and division together. Let's see. For example, 87 * (something) + or - the rest.\n\nLet me try 87 * 10 is 870. 870 + 48=918. Then 918 - (853 -32). Wait, 853-32=821. 918-821=97. Not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, 87* something. Let's see. 87*10=870. 911-870=41. Can I make 41 from 853,48,32? Probably not. Alternatively, 87*9=783. 911-783=128. Can I make 128 from 853,48,32? 48+32=80, 853-80=773. Not 128. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe 853 - (something) =911. But that would require the something to be negative. Which isn't possible since all numbers are positive. So that approach is out.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of 911 as 853 + 58. So need 58 from 87,48,32. Wait, 87 - (48 -32) =87 -16=71. No. 87 -48 +32=71. Still no. Wait, 48 +32=80. 87 -80=7. Not 58. How else?\n\nWait, 32 + (87 -48) =32 +39=71. No. Hmm. Maybe multiply and divide. Let's see. (87 *32)=2784. That's way too big. 2784 divided by 48=58. Oh! Wait a minute. 87 *32=2784. Then 2784 /48=58. Exactly! So then 853 +58=911. \n\nLet me check: 87 * 32 = 2784. Then divide by 48: 2784 /48=58. Then 853 +58=911. So that works. \n\nSo the equation would be 853 + (87 *32)/48=911. Let me verify the operations. Using all numbers: 853, 87,32,48. Yes. Each used once. The operations are multiply, divide, and add. \n\nCalculations: 87*32=2784. Then 2784 divided by48=58. Then 853+58=911. Correct. \n\nSo the equation is 853 + (87 × 32) ÷ 48 =911. That should work.\n</think>\n\n<answer>853 + (87 * 32) / 48 = 911</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using all the numbers 61, 825, 88, and 2 exactly once, and the result should be 854. Hmm. The operations allowed are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Let me start by thinking about the target number, 854. Let's see how close I can get with these numbers.\n\nFirst, let's consider the larger numbers. 825 is a big one. If I subtract something from 825, maybe that could help. 825 plus or minus... Let's see. 854 is 29 more than 825. So 825 + 29 = 854. But how can I get 29 from the remaining numbers: 61, 88, and 2? Hmm. Let's see. 88 divided by something. 88 divided by 2 is 44. That's too much. 61 minus something. 61 - (88/2) = 61 -44=17. Then 825 +17=842. Close, but not 854. Not quite there.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 61 multiplied by something. 61*14=854. Wait, that's exactly the target. But do I have a 14? Let me check. The numbers left would be 825, 88, 2. How to get 14 from those. 88 divided by something. 88 / (825-2)? No, that's 88/823 which is way too small. Alternatively, 825 - (88* something). 88*9 is 792, 825-792=33. Not helpful. Hmm. Maybe this approach isn't working.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe combining 88 and 61. 88 +61=149. Then 149*something. 149*5.7 is around 854, but we need integers. Not sure. Alternatively, 88*61=5368. That's way too big. How about 88-61=27. 27* something. 27*31.6 is around 854. Not helpful. \n\nWait, what if I use multiplication with 2. Like 88*2=176. Then 825 -176=649. Not helpful. Or 825 +176=1001. Then subtract something. 1001 - (61 + something). 1001 -61=940. Still not 854. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, 825 divided by something. 825/2=412.5. Then 412.5 +88=500.5. Plus 61 is 561.5. Not close. Maybe 825 - (88* something). Let's see 88*9=792, so 825-792=33. Then 33*61=2013. No, that's way off.\n\nWait, maybe start with 88. Let's see. 88 * (2 + something) = 854. 854 /88 is approximately 9.7. So 9.7 minus 2 is 7.7. But we have 61 and 825 left. Not sure. Alternatively, 88 * 9 = 792, then 792 + 61=853. Oh, that's really close. 853 is just one less than 854. How did I get that? 88*9=792, plus 61 is 853. But where does 9 come from? Because 9 isn't one of the numbers. Unless I can make 9 from the remaining numbers. Wait, the numbers I need to use are 825 and 2. 825 divided by something. 825/92. Not helpful. Or 825 - (something), but that's not 9. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 825 minus 61 is 764. Then 764 plus 88 is 852. Then plus 2 is 854. Wait, that works! Let's check: 825 -61 = 764. Then 764 +88 = 852. 852 +2=854. But wait, did I use all the numbers? Let's see: 825, 61, 88, 2. Yes! All used once. So that would be (825 -61) +88 +2 =854. Let me calculate that again: 825-61=764. 764+88=852. 852+2=854. Perfect. That uses all numbers once and the operations are subtraction and addition. So the equation would be (825 - 61) + 88 + 2 = 854. Let me check if that's allowed. Since each number is used once and all operations are allowed. Yes. That should work. \n\nAlternatively, to write it in a way that groups correctly, maybe (825 - 61) + (88 + 2) = 764 +90=854. Yes. So either way. The key is using 825 minus 61, which gives 764, then adding 88 and 2 which sum to 90, totaling 854. That's the solution. I think that's the right approach. Let me confirm again. 825-61=764. 88+2=90. 764+90=854. Yep. So the equation is (825 - 61) + 88 + 2 = 854. Or maybe (825 -61) + (88 +2) =854. Either way is correct. So that's the answer.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(825 - 61) + 88 + 2 = 854</answer>"}]}

Let me start by listing out the numbers: 9, 17, 9, 45. I have two 9s, so maybe I can combine them somehow.\n\nFirst, maybe I should look for combinations that get close to 117. 45 is a big number, so maybe multiplying it by something. 45 times 2 is 90, which is less than 117. 45 times 3 is 135, which is over. So maybe 45*2.6 or something, but that's not helpful since we have to use integers and the given numbers.\n\nWait, 45 plus something. 45 + 72 is 117. How to get 72 from the other numbers: 17, 9, 9. Let's see, 17 plus 9 is 26, plus 9 is 35. Not enough. Maybe 17 multiplied by something. 17*4 is 68, which is not 72. 17*3 is 51. 9*9 is 81. 81 minus 17 is 64. Not 72. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, 45 plus 17 is 62. Then 62 plus 55 would be 117. But I need to get 55 from the remaining 9 and 9. 9*6 + 1, but that's not possible. Alternatively, 9*5 + 10? No, not with two 9s. Maybe 9+9=18. 18*3.06... Not helpful. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe using subtraction. 45*2=90. If I can get 27 from the other numbers. 17 +9 +9=35. 35-8=27, but I don't have an 8. Not helpful. Alternatively, 45* (something). Let's see, 45*2.6 is 117. But 2.6 is not possible here. Maybe 45*(17-9)/9. Let me check that: 17-9=8, 8/9 is about 0.888, so 45*0.888≈40. Not close.\n\nWait another approach. 117 divided by 45 is 2.6. Maybe I can combine the other numbers to get 2.6. But that seems tricky. Alternatively, maybe using division in another way. For example, 45 + (17*9)/something. Let's see: 17*9=153. If I divide that by 9, I get 17. 45 +17=62. Not enough. Or 45 +17* something. 45 +17=62. 62 + 9 +9=80. Still low.\n\nWait, maybe multiplication and addition. 17*9=153. Then 153 -45=108. Then adding the remaining 9: 108+9=117. But that uses 17,9,45,9. Let me check: 17*9=153. 153-45=108. 108+9=117. Yes, that uses all the numbers: 17,9,45,9. Each number once, but wait, 9 is used twice. Wait, the problem says we have to use each number only once, and all numbers must be used. So the two 9s are separate. So in this case, 17*9=153 uses one 9, then 153-45=108, then 108+9=117 uses the other 9. So all numbers are used once. Let me check: 17, 9 (first), 45, 9 (second). Yes, all four numbers. So the equation would be (17*9) -45 +9 =117. Let's verify: 17*9=153, 153-45=108, 108+9=117. Yes! That works. So the equation is (17*9) -45 +9 =117. But let me write it properly with parentheses if needed. Alternatively, it's 17*9 +9 -45. Let me calculate again: 17*9=153, plus 9=162, minus 45=117. Yes. So 17*9 +9 -45 =117.

Hmm, let's see. \n\nFirst, I should think about the target number, which is 16. Let me consider possible operations that can lead to 16. Since the numbers are quite varied in size (like 874 is much larger than 25 and 61), maybe division or subtraction could be useful here to bring down the larger numbers.\n\nStarting with the largest number, 874. If I can divide 874 by something to get close to 16, that might help. Let's check: 874 divided by 54 is approximately 16.18, which is close. But wait, 54 isn't one of our numbers. Alternatively, 874 divided by 55 is about 15.89. Hmm, not quite. But maybe if I can create 54.625 using the other numbers? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe subtract a large number from another to get 16. For instance, 74 - 58 = 16. But 58 isn't among the numbers. Wait, the numbers are 74, 61, 25, 874. Maybe 74 minus something else? Let's see: 74 - (61 + 25) = 74 - 86 = -12. Not helpful.\n\nWhat about combining division and subtraction? Let's see. Maybe 874 divided by one of the numbers, then subtract or add others. For example, 874 / 25 is 34.96. If I subtract 61 from that, I get 34.96 - 61 = negative, which isn't helpful. If I subtract 74, same issue. Alternatively, 874 / 61 is approximately 14.327. If I can add 1.673 to that, I get 16. But how to get 1.673 from 74 and 25? 25 divided by 74 is about 0.337, which is not enough. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 61 - (something) =16. So 61 - 45 =16. How to get 45? 25 + 20, but 20 isn't available. Or 74 - 29. Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe using multiplication. For example, 25 - (something) =16. Then that something would be 9. How to get 9 from 74, 61, 874? Maybe 74 - 65 =9, but 65 isn't there. Alternatively, 874 divided by 61 is 14.327, subtract that from 25: 25 -14.327=10.673. Not helpful.\n\nAnother approach: Let's consider all numbers and possible operations between them. Maybe combine two numbers into a result, then combine with another. For example, (874 - 74) = 800. Then 800 divided by (61 -25). Let's compute 61 -25=36. 800 /36 ≈22.22. Not 16. Close but not quite.\n\nWait, 874 - 74 is 800. 800 divided by 50 is 16. But 50 isn't one of the numbers. But 61 -25 is 36. Not 50. Hmm. Alternatively, 61 +25=86. 874 /86 is approximately 10.163. If I subtract 74 from that, it's negative. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe (874 / 25) - (74 - 61). Let's compute: 874/25 is 34.96. 74-61 is 13. So 34.96 -13=21.96. Close to 22, not 16.\n\nAnother idea: 25 * something =16. But 25 is a factor here, and 16/25 is 0.64. Maybe 0.64 can be formed from other numbers. For example, (74 -61)/874. (13)/874 ≈0.0149. Not 0.64.\n\nAlternatively, 25 divided by something equals 16. That would require 25/16=1.5625. So if I can get 1.5625 from other numbers. For instance, (74 +61)/874 =135/874≈0.1544. No.\n\nWait, maybe using subtraction and division. Let's see: 874 - 74 = 800. Then 800 divided by 50 is 16. But how to get 50 from 61 and 25. 61 - 25=36. 61 - (25 + something). Wait, maybe 61 - (25 + x) where x is another number, but all numbers must be used once. So perhaps 61 - (25 + (74/ something)), but I have to use all numbers. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, 61 - (25 + (something)). Let's see, if I do 61 - (25 + (874/74)). Let's compute 874/74=11.81. So 25 +11.81=36.81. 61 -36.81≈24.19. Not 16.\n\nWait, maybe 874 divided by (74 - (61 -25)). Let's compute the denominator: 61-25=36, 74-36=38. 874/38≈23. So no.\n\nAlternatively, (61 +25) =86. 874 -86=788. 788 divided by something. 788 divided by 49.25=16. But 49.25 is 197/4. Not sure how to get that.\n\nWait, 74 - 61=13. Then 25 -13=12. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 25 * (something) =16. Let me think again. Maybe 25 * (something) divided by another number. For example, 25 * (874 -74) / (61). Let's compute 874-74=800. 25*800=20,000. 20,000 /61≈327.87. Not 16.\n\nWait, maybe (874 - (74* something)) divided by 61. Let's try 74*25=1850. 874-1850= -976. -976/61= -16. Oh! That's negative 16. But the target is 16. So maybe we can take the absolute value or rearrange. Hmm.\n\nWait, the equation (874 - 74*25)/61. Let's compute that: 74*25=1850. 874-1850= -976. -976/61= -16. So that's -16. But the problem requires 16. Maybe there's a way to reverse the order. For example, (74*25 -874)/61. Let's compute that: 74*25=1850. 1850-874=976. 976/61=16. Exactly! Because 61 times 16 is 976. So that works. Let me check the numbers: 74, 25, 874, 61. All used once. The operations are multiplication, subtraction, and division. So the equation is (74*25 -874)/61 =16.\n\nYes, that works. Let me verify the calculation step by step. 74 multiplied by 25 is indeed 1850. Subtract 874 from that gives 1850 -874=976. Then divide by 61: 976 divided by 61. Let's do 61*16=976. Correct. So this equation gives 16. Perfect.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(74 * 25 - 874) / 61 = 16</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using the numbers 8, 8, 42, and 7, each exactly once, and the result should be 294. The operations allowed are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Hmm, let's start by thinking about what 294 is made of. Well, 294 divided by 42 is 7, because 42 times 7 is 294. Oh, wait! So if I can somehow use 42 and 7 together, maybe that's a part of the equation. Let me check: 42 * 7 = 294. But then I still have the two 8s left. Since I have to use all numbers, I need to incorporate the 8s into the equation without changing the result. Maybe I can combine the 8s in a way that their operation results in 1, so that multiplying or adding them doesn't change the value. For example, 8 divided by 8 is 1. Then, if I multiply 42 by 7 and then multiply by (8/8), that would still be 294. Let me write that down: 42 * 7 * (8 / 8). Let's calculate that: 42*7 is 294, and 8/8 is 1, so 294*1 is 294. That works! And all numbers are used once. Let me check if there's another possible way, but this seems straightforward. Alternatively, maybe subtract 8 and 8 to get 0, but adding 0 to 294 would still require the 0 to be part of the equation. But I don't think that's necessary here. The first idea works. So the equation would be (42 * 7 * (8 / 8)) = 294. Let me verify again: 8 divided by 8 is 1. 42 multiplied by 7 is 294. Then 294 multiplied by 1 is indeed 294. All numbers used once. Perfect!\n</think>\n\n<answer>(42 * 7) * (8 / 8) = 294</answer>"}]}

Each number can only be used once, and I can use basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Hmm, where do I start?\n\nFirst, maybe I should think about the target number, 250. Let's see what operations could get me there. 250 is a number that's a multiple of 10, so maybe combining numbers to get 250 through addition or subtraction. Let's see the numbers given: 226 is the largest. If I subtract something from 226 to get close to 250, but 226 is already less than 250. Wait, 226 plus 24 would be 250. Do I have a way to get 24 from the remaining numbers? Let's check the remaining numbers: 96, 32, 40. Hmm, 32 minus (something) could be 24. If I take 32 - 8 =24. Do I have an 8? Not directly, but 40 divided by 5 is 8. Wait, but how do I get 5 from the remaining numbers? I have 96 left. Wait, maybe another approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can combine 96 and 40. Let's see, 96 + 40 = 136. Then 226 - 136 = 90. Hmm, not helpful. What about 96 - 40 = 56. Then 56 + 226 = 282. Then subtract 32? 282 -32=250. Wait, that's possible! Let me check:\n\n226 + (96 -40) -32. Let's compute step by step:\n\n96 -40 =56\n\n226 +56=282\n\n282 -32=250. Yes! So that uses all the numbers: 226,96,40,32. Each used once. So the equation would be 226 + 96 -40 -32 =250. Let me verify:\n\n226 +96 is 322. 322 minus 40 is 282. 282 minus32 is 250. Perfect. So the equation is 226 +96 -40 -32=250. Wait, but the numbers are all used once. Yes: 226,96,40,32. All four numbers. Each once. Operations are +, -, -,.\n\nBut maybe another way? Let me check if there's another combination. For example, using multiplication or division. Let's see: 32 and 40. 40 * 6.25=250, but that's not helpful. 226 - (something)=250. Wait, 226 is less than 250, so subtraction won't help here. Maybe adding 226 and some other numbers. Let's see: 226 + 96=322. Then subtract 72 to get 250. How to get 72 from 32 and 40? 32 +40=72. So 226 +96 - (32+40)=250. Which is the same as before. So that equation would be 226 +96 -32 -40=250. Same result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using division. For example, 96 divided by 32 is 3. Then 3 multiplied by something. Let's see: 96 /32=3. Then 3 * 40=120. Then 226 +120=346. Not helpful. Alternatively, 226 divided by something? 226/40 is about 5.65. Not useful. Maybe 32*40=1280. That's way too big. Hmm. Alternatively, 40 - (96/32) =40-3=37. Then 226 +37=263. Not helpful. 263 is more than 250. Maybe 226 - (40/(96/32)). Let's compute: 96/32=3, so 40/3≈13.33. 226 -13.33≈212.67. Not close. Hmm.\n\nAnother angle: 250 = 226 +24. So I need 24 from 96,32,40. How? Let's see. 96 - (32 +40) =96-72=24. So 226 + (96 -32 -40)=250. Which is the same equation as before. So that's the same as 226 +96 -32 -40=250. So that seems to be the solution. Let me check if this is correct again. Yes, because 96-32-40=24, then 226+24=250.\n\nSo I think that's the correct equation. All numbers used once, operations are addition and subtraction. So the equation is 226 + 96 - 32 -40 =250.\n</think>\n\n<answer>226 + 96 - 40 - 32 = 250</answer>"}]}

Let me start by thinking about how these numbers can combine.\n\nFirst, since there are two 46s, maybe they can be used together somehow. Like 46 divided by 46 is 1, which is useful. But then I have to incorporate the 89 and 90. If I use 46/46 =1, then I need to combine that 1 with 89 and 90 to still get 1. Hmm, maybe subtract them? But 89 and 90 are close. Wait, 90 - 89 is 1. So if I have (46/46) * (90 - 89) that would be 1 * 1 =1. Let me check:\n\n46 divided by 46 is 1. Then 90 minus 89 is 1. Multiply those together: 1 *1=1. So that uses all numbers: 46, 46, 90, 89. Each used once. That works. So the equation would be (46 / 46) * (90 - 89) =1. Let me make sure there's no other way, but this seems straightforward. Alternatively, maybe using subtraction and division in another order. For example, 90 - (89 + 46/46) = 90 - (89 +1) =90-90=0. That's 0, which isn't helpful. Or  (90 - 89) + (46 -46) =1 +0=1. But that uses a subtraction of the two 46s, but then we have 1 +0. But does that use all numbers? Yes: 90,89,46,46. So that's another possibility: (90 -89) + (46 -46) =1. But wait, 46 -46 is 0, so adding that to 1 gives 1. But does that count as using all numbers? Yes, each number is used once. But in that case, the equation would be (90 -89) + (46 -46) =1. But the problem states that each number can only be used once. Wait, but in this case, both 46s are used. So that's allowed because we have two 46s. So that's another valid solution. But which one is better? The first one uses division and multiplication, the second uses subtraction and addition. Both are valid. The problem says to create an equation, either is acceptable. But maybe the first one is more efficient. Let me check the problem again: the example given is (1 + 2)/3. So perhaps using the operations in a combined way. So the first solution combines both operations. Alternatively, the second solution is simpler. Both are valid. But perhaps the first one is more interesting. Let me verify again. Using 46/46 * (90-89) =1. Yes, that works. So maybe that's the equation. Alternatively, could there be other combinations? Let's see. Maybe 89 - (90 / (46/46)). Let's compute that: 46/46=1, so 90/1=90. Then 89-90= -1. Not helpful. How about (89 +46) - (90 +46) = (135) - (136) = -1. Not 1. Maybe (90 - (89 +46)) /46. That would be (90-135)/46= (-45)/46= -0.978... Not 1. What if we do (90 -46) / (89 -46). 90-46=44, 89-46=43. 44/43≈1.023. Close but not 1. Hmm. Another approach: Maybe multiply two numbers and subtract others. For example, 46 * 2 is 92, but we don't have a 2. Wait, but we have 90 and 89. Let's see, 90 -89=1. So if we can get 1 and then combine with the 46s. For example, 1 + (46 -46)=1. So that's similar to the second equation. Alternatively, 46 - (something) to get 1. Wait, 89 - (90/(46/46))= 89 - (90/1)= -1. Not helpful. Alternatively, (90 - (46 +46)) /89. Let's compute that: 90-92= -2, divided by 89 is -2/89. Not 1. How about ((46 +46) -89) / (90 -89). 92-89=3. 90-89=1. 3/1=3. Not 1. Hmm. Let's think again. The simplest solutions seem to be either (90 -89) + (46 -46) or (46/46) * (90 -89). Both use all numbers once each (including both 46s) and result in 1. Since both are valid, either could be the answer. But the problem might prefer using all operations in a more combined way. Let me check if there are other possibilities. Maybe 90/(89 -46) -46. Let's compute denominator:89-46=43. 90/43≈2.093. Then 2.093 -46≈-43.9. Not 1. Alternatively, 46/(90 -89) -46. 90-89=1, so 46/1=46. 46-46=0. Not 1. Maybe 89/(46 +46) + (90 - something). 46+46=92. 89/92≈0.967. Then 0.967 + (90 - something) needs to be 1, but that would require 90 - something ≈0.033, which is possible but not with the remaining numbers. Not helpful. Another angle: maybe using multiplication and division. For example, 46 * (90 -89) /46. That's (46*1)/46=1. So that's 46*(90-89)/46. Which simplifies to 1. So that's another way to write the first equation. But perhaps using parentheses differently. Let me check the order of operations. 46*(90-89) is 46*1=46. Then divided by 46 gives 1. So that's equivalent to (46*(90-89))/46 =1. Alternatively, 46/(46*(90-89)) would be 1/(1)=1, but that uses multiplication in denominator. Wait, but we need to use all numbers. If I write 46/(46*(90-89))=1. Let's see: denominator is 46*1=46, so 46/46=1. But that uses the 46 once in numerator and once in denominator. So the equation would be 46 / (46 * (90 -89)) =1. That uses all four numbers: 46,46,90,89. Each once. That's a valid equation. So that's another way. So this is also a valid equation. So multiple possibilities. The problem allows using operations one or multiple times. So this equation would also work. So for example, 46 ÷ (46 × (90 − 89)) =1. That's correct. So this is another valid solution. So there are multiple correct equations. The user might accept any of them. So the first one I thought of was (46/46) * (90 -89)=1. Another is (90 -89) + (46 -46)=1. Third is 46/(46*(90-89))=1. All are correct. Let me verify each:\n\nFirst: (46/46) is 1, (90-89)=1, so 1*1=1. Correct. Uses all numbers.\n\nSecond: 90-89=1, 46-46=0. 1+0=1. Correct. Uses all numbers.\n\nThird: (90-89)=1, 46*1=46. 46/46=1. Correct. Uses all numbers.\n\nSo the problem is to choose one. Since the example uses parentheses and combines operations, perhaps the first or third. But the third uses division and multiplication with parentheses. Maybe the third one is more efficient. But the first is also good. Let me see which is shorter. The third is 46/(46*(90-89)), which is 46 divided by (46 multiplied by (90-89)). The first is (46/46) multiplied by (90-89). Both are similar. Either way, both are correct. The user might prefer the first because it's simpler, but both are acceptable. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the first solution. Anyway, as long as it's correct. So I can present any of these. Let me pick one. Let's go with the third one: 46/(46*(90-89))=1. Because it uses all operations except subtraction once. Wait, no, subtraction is used in 90-89. So operations used are subtraction, multiplication, and division. While the first uses division and multiplication. Either way, both are valid. Alternatively, the second solution uses subtraction and addition, but that might be simpler. But I think the first one is more likely what is expected. So I'll present that. Alternatively, the problem might prefer using all four numbers in a single expression without separate parts. So the third option combines them all into one expression: 46 divided by (46 multiplied by (90 minus 89)). Which is a single equation. Let me check the arithmetic: 90-89=1, 46*1=46, 46 divided by 46=1. Yes. So that's correct. So writing it as 46/(46*(90-89))=1. That's a solid answer. Alternatively, it can be written with different parentheses, but the order of operations would still hold. So I think that's a good answer. So the final answer would be <answer>46/(46*(90-89))=1</answer>.\n</think>\n\n<answer>46/(46*(90-89))=1</answer>"}]}

Let's start by listing out the numbers and thinking about possible operations.\n\nFirst, maybe I can look for numbers that are close to each other or have obvious relationships. For example, 94 and 13 might add up to 107, which is close to 114 but not quite there. Then 65 and 13: 65 minus 13 is 52, which doesn't help much. 100 minus 13 is 87. Maybe adding that to something else? Let's see.\n\nWait, 100 plus 13 is 113, which is just one less than 114. If I can get a 1 from the remaining numbers 65 and 94. But how? 94 minus 65 is 29. Hmm, that's not helpful. 65 divided by 94 would be less than 1. Maybe not. Alternatively, 94 divided by something. Wait, 94 divided by 13 is about 7.23, which might not help.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about multiplication. 13 times 9 is 117, but we don't have a 9. Wait, 100 divided by something. 100 divided by 13 is approximately 7.69. Not sure. Maybe 65 times something. 65 times 1.7 is around 110.5. Not quite.\n\nAnother approach: subtract two numbers to get a certain value and then add or subtract others. For example, 94 minus 65 is 29. Then 29 plus 100 is 129. Then 129 minus 13 is 116. Close, but not 114. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe (100 - 94) = 6. Then 6 * 13 = 78. 78 + 65 = 143. That's way over. Alternatively, 100 - (94 / something). 94 divided by 13 is about 7.23. 100 minus 7.23 is ~92.77. Then adding 65 would be 157.77. Not helpful.\n\nWhat if we do 65 + 13 = 78. Then 100 - 78 = 22. 94 - 22 = 72. Not useful. Alternatively, 13 * 5 = 65, so maybe 13 * (something) to get 65, but that's already using 13 and 65. Wait, that's exactly 13*5=65. So maybe 13*(something) plus or minus others.\n\nWait, using all numbers: 13, 65, 94, 100. Let's try combining 94 and 65 first. 94 +65=159. Then subtract 13=146. Then 146-100=46. No. Alternatively, 94-65=29. 29+100=129. 129-13=116. Still not 114.\n\nWhat about 100 + 13 = 113. Then we need 1 more. But the remaining numbers are 65 and 94. Maybe 94 - 65 =29. Then 113 + (94-65) =113+29=142. Not helpful. Or 113 - (94-65)=113-29=84. Not.\n\nAlternatively, 13 * (something). Let's see, 13 * 8 = 104. If I can get 8 from 100, 65, 94. Maybe 100 - (94 -65) =100-29=71. Then 71 divided by something? 71 is a prime. Hmm.\n\nWait, 100 - 94 =6. Then 65 -13=52. 6 +52=58. Not 114. Alternatively, 100 +65=165. Then 165 -94=71. 71 +13=84. Still no.\n\nAnother angle: 94 + 65 =159. Then 159 - 100 =59. 59 -13=46. Nope. 94 +13=107. Then 107 +65=172. 172-100=72. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe multiplication and division. Let's try 100 divided by something. 100 / (something) to get a certain value. If I do 100 / (94 - 65) = 100 /29 ≈3.448. Then multiply by 13? 3.448 *13 ≈44.82. No.\n\nHow about 65 + (100 /13) ≈65 +7.692≈72.692. Then 94 -72.692≈21.308. Not useful.\n\nAlternatively, 94 * (13 / 65). Let's compute that: 13/65=0.2. Then 94*0.2=18.8. Then 100 -18.8=81.2. Not 114.\n\nHmm. Maybe combining operations differently. Let's try 94 + 13 =107. Then 107 + (100 -65)=107+35=142. No. 107 - (100-65)=107-35=72. Not.\n\nWait, maybe 100 - (94 / (65 -13)). Let's compute denominator:65-13=52. 94 /52≈1.8077. 100 -1.8077≈98.192. Then adding 13? 111.192. Close, but not 114. Not quite.\n\nAlternatively, 65 * (13 - (100 -94)). Let's see:100-94=6. 13-6=7. 65*7=455. That's way over.\n\nAnother idea: 94 + (13 * (100 /65)). Let's compute 100/65≈1.538. Multiply by 13≈20. So 94 +20=114. Wait, wait! Let me check that. 100 divided by 65 is approximately 1.53846. Multiply by 13: 1.53846 *13. Let's compute that exactly. 1.53846 *10=15.3846, plus 1.53846*3=4.61538. Total≈15.3846 +4.61538≈20. So 94 +20≈114. That's exactly 114!\n\nWait, let's compute it precisely. 100 /65 is exactly 20/13 (since 100/65 = 20/13). Then 20/13 multiplied by 13 is 20. So 94 +20=114. Yes! So the equation would be 94 + (13 * (100 /65)) =114. Let's check:\n\nFirst, 100 divided by 65 is 100/65. Then multiply by 13: (100/65)*13 = (100*13)/65 = (100/5) =20, since 65 is 13*5. So 13* (100/65)=20. Then 94 +20=114. Perfect! So the equation is 94 + (13 * (100 / 65)) =114. Let me confirm all numbers are used once: 94,13,100,65. Yes. All used once. And operations are division, multiplication, addition. Perfect.\n</think>\n\n<answer>94 + 13 * (100 / 65) = 114</answer>"}]}

I need to make an equation using 92, 2, 29, and 40, each exactly once, with basic operations, and the result should be 672. Hmm.\n\nFirst, let's recall that 672 is a multiple of some of these numbers. Let me check. 672 divided by 2 is 336. Maybe 336 can be made from the other numbers? But I have to use 29 and 40. Hmm. Let's see. 40 times something. 40 times 8 is 320, but 40 times 8.4 would be 336. But I don't have an 8.4 here. Maybe that's not the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, 29 multiplied by something. 29 times 23 is 667, which is close to 672. But how to get 23 from the remaining numbers? The remaining numbers would be 92, 2, 40. Wait, 40 minus (92 divided by 2) is 40 - 46 = -6. Not helpful. Maybe 92 divided by 40 is 2.3, then 2.3 plus 2 is 4.3. Not helpful either.\n\nWait, maybe combining 92 and 2 first. 92 divided by 2 is 46. Then using 46 with 29 and 40. 46 times 40 is 1840. That's way too big. 46 plus 40 is 86. 86 times 29 would be 2494, which is way over. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, 92 minus 40 is 52. 52 times 29 is 1508, which is still over. 52 plus 29 is 81. 81 times 2 is 162. No. Not helpful.\n\nWait, let's think of 672 as a product. Let's factor 672. 672 is 16*42, or 24*28, or 12*56, 14*48, etc. Let me see. Maybe 40 is part of that. 40 multiplied by 16.8 is 672. But 16.8 is not straightforward. Alternatively, 29*23.172... which is not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe adding numbers. Let's see: 92 + 2 + 29 + 40 = 163. That's way too low. So addition alone isn't enough. Subtraction? Let's see: 92 - 2 -29 -40 = 21. No. Multiplication and division needed.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe use 92 and 40 to make a big number. 92 * 40 = 3680. Then divide by something. 3680 divided by 5.476... which is 672. But I need to get 5.476 from 29 and 2. Not sure. 29 divided by 2 is 14.5. 3680 /14.5 is 253.79... Not 672.\n\nAlternatively, 92 * 29 = 2668. Then 2668 divided by something. 2668 divided by 4 is 667. Close to 672. But 4 is not available. Or 2668 minus (40*2) = 2668 -80 = 2588. Not helpful.\n\nWait, 40 * 2 is 80. 92 -80 is 12. Then 12 *29 = 348. No. Not 672.\n\nHmm. Let's think of 29 and 40. 40 -29 =11. Then 92 *11 is 1012. Then 1012 *2 is 2024. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 40 +29=69. 92 -69=23. 23*2=46. Still no.\n\nWait, 92 * (40 - (29 -2)). Let's compute inside the parentheses first: 29 -2 =27. 40 -27=13. 92*13=1196. Not 672.\n\nAlternatively, 92 * (40 -29) /2. 40-29=11. 92*11=1012. 1012/2=506. No.\n\nWait, maybe (92 +40) * (29 -2). 92+40=132. 29-2=27. 132*27=3564. Way too big.\n\nHmm. Let me try another angle. 672 divided by 29 is approximately 23.172. If I can make 23.172 from 92, 2, 40. But 92 divided by 40 is 2.3. 2.3 *10 is 23. But how to get 10. Wait, 2 and 40. 40 divided by 2 is 20. Not 10. Alternatively, 40 - (92/2) =40 -46= -6. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe (92 /2) is 46. Then 46 * (40 -29). 40-29=11. 46*11=506. Still not 672.\n\nAlternatively, 29 * (40 - (92/2)). Let's compute: 92/2=46. 40-46= -6. 29*(-6)= -174. No.\n\nHmm. Maybe I need to use division in a way that multiplies to 672. Let's see. Let me list all possible combinations.\n\nSuppose I do 92 * 2 =184. Then 184 *29=5336. Then 5336 divided by 40 is 133.4. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 92 *29=2668. 2668 *2=5336. Divide by 40=133.4. No.\n\nWait, maybe 40 * 29=1160. 1160 + (92 *2)=1160+184=1344. Then 1344 divided by 2=672. Wait, but that would require using 2 twice. Because 92*2 uses the 2, and then dividing by 2 again would use it again. But we can only use each number once. So that's not allowed.\n\nHmm. Let's see. 40*29=1160. 1160 - 92=1068. 1068 *2=2136. No.\n\nAlternatively, 40*2=80. 80*29=2320. 2320 -92=2228. Not 672.\n\nWait, maybe 92* (40 - (29 -2)). Let's compute 29-2=27. 40-27=13. 92*13=1196. No.\n\nWait, maybe (92 -40) * (29 -2). 92-40=52. 29-2=27. 52*27=1404. Still too high.\n\nHmm. Let's try another combination. 92 divided by 2 is 46. Then 46 multiplied by something. 46*29=1334. 1334 -40=1294. No. Or 46 +29=75. 75*40=3000. 3000/2=1500. No.\n\nWait, maybe 92*2=184. Then 184 +40=224. 224*29=6496. Divide by something? But we have already used 92,2,40. Only 29 left. So 6496/29=224. So that's 224. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 92 - (40/2) =92-20=72. 72*29=2088. 2088/ something=672. 2088 divided by 3.1... No. But we have to use all numbers. So 40 and 2 are already used in 40/2.\n\nHmm. Maybe (92 +40) * (29 -2). 132*27=3564. Not.\n\nAlternatively, 29*(40 - 2)=29*38=1102. 1102 +92=1194. No.\n\nWait, 29*2=58. 58*40=2320. 2320 -92=2228. No.\n\nHmm. Maybe division in a way that gives a larger number. Let's think. 40 divided by 2 is 20. 92*20=1840. 1840 divided by 29 is 63.448... Not 672.\n\nAlternatively, 92 divided by 29 is approximately 3.172. Then 3.172 *40*2=3.172*80=253.76. No.\n\nWait, 29*40=1160. 1160 -92=1068. 1068*2=2136. No.\n\nWait, maybe (29*2) + (92*40). 58 + 3680=3738. No.\n\nHmm. This is tricky. Let me try to factor 672 again. 672 factors into 2^5 * 3 * 7. Let's see if we can get those factors from the numbers. The numbers we have are 92 (which is 4*23), 2, 29, 40 (which is 8*5). Hmm.\n\nSo 92 can be broken into 4*23, 40 is 8*5. Maybe combine factors. Let's see: 92 *40=3680. Then 3680 divided by (29*2)=58. 3680/58≈63.45. Not 672. Wait, 3680 divided by 5.476... equals 672. But how to get that from 29 and 2. 29/2=14.5. No. 29-2=27. 27 is 3^3. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 40/2=20. 20*29=580. 580 +92=672. Wait, let's check. 40 divided by 2 is 20. 20 times 29 is 580. Then 580 plus 92 is 672. Oh! That works! Because 40/2=20, 20*29=580, 580+92=672. All numbers used once: 40,2,29,92. Exactly once each. So the equation would be (40 / 2) * 29 + 92 = 672. Let me verify:\n\n40 divided by 2 is 20. 20 multiplied by 29 is 580. 580 plus 92 is indeed 672. Yes! That works.\n</think>\n\n<answer>((40 / 2) * 29) + 92 = 672</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using the numbers 51, 50, 15, and 888, each exactly once, and combine them with basic arithmetic operations to get 974. Hmm, that's a bit tricky. Let me start by thinking about the target number, 974. It's close to 888, which is one of the numbers provided. Maybe I can use 888 as a base and then add or subtract the other numbers to reach 974.\n\nSo 974 minus 888 is 86. So if I can get 86 from the remaining numbers 51, 50, and 15, that might work. Let's see. How can I combine 51, 50, and 15 to get 86? Let me try different combinations. \n\nFirst, 51 + 50 is 101, then adding 15 gives 116, which is too big. Subtracting 15 from 101 would be 86. Wait, that's exactly 86! So 51 + 50 - 15 = 86. Then adding that to 888 would give 888 + 86 = 974. But I need to use all four numbers, each exactly once. So the equation would be 888 + (51 + 50 - 15) = 974. Let me check that. \n\nCalculating inside the parentheses: 51 + 50 is 101, subtract 15 gives 86. Then 888 + 86 is indeed 974. But I need to make sure that all numbers are used once. The numbers used here are 888, 51, 50, and 15. Yes, all four are used. So the equation would be 888 + 51 + 50 - 15 = 974. Let me verify the arithmetic again. \n\n888 plus 51 is 939. 939 plus 50 is 989. Then subtract 15 gives 974. Yes, that works. So the equation is correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way, but this seems to work. Let me check if there's another combination just in case. For example, if I try multiplying some numbers. 50 * 15 is 750. Then 888 - 750 is 138. Then 51 + 138 is 189, which is not 974. Not helpful. \n\nWhat if I subtract 50 from 888? That gives 838. Then maybe use 51 and 15. 51 * 15 is 765. Adding that to 838 would be way over. 838 + 765 is 1603. Nope. \n\nAnother approach: Maybe divide. For example, 888 divided by something. But 888 divided by 15 is 59.2, which isn't helpful. 51 divided by 15 is 3.4. Maybe 50 * (51/15) = 50*3.4=170. Then 888 + 170 is 1058. Not enough. \n\nAlternatively, 888 - (50 / 15). That would be 888 - ~3.333 = 884.666, not helpful. \n\nHow about multiplying 51 and 50? 51*50=2550. Then subtract 888? 2550 - 888 = 1662. Then subtract 15? 1662 -15=1647. Not close. \n\nHmm. Alternatively, maybe 888 + 50 = 938. Then 51*15=765. 938 +765=1703. No. \n\nAnother idea: 51*15=765. Then 888 - 765=123. Then 123 +50=173. Not helpful. \n\nWait, back to the original solution: 888 +51 +50 -15. Let me confirm that again. 51+50=101. 101-15=86. 888+86=974. Yes, that works. So the equation is 888 + 51 + 50 - 15 = 974.

The operations allowed are +, -, *, /, and each number can only be used once. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to think about how to combine these numbers. The target is 67, which is one of the numbers given. But since we have to use all numbers, maybe I can somehow subtract or add the other numbers to get 67. Let me list the numbers again: 46, 7, 67, 53.\n\nWait, 67 is already there. But how can we use all numbers? Maybe use 67 as a result of some operations and then include the other numbers. For example, if I can make an equation where 67 is part of the operation and then combine the other numbers to cancel out or add up to it. Let's try different combinations.\n\nLet me try starting with 67. If I have 67, maybe subtract something to get back to 67. That might not work. Alternatively, maybe multiply or divide. Let's see. 67 minus (46 + 7 + 53) would be 67 - (46+7+53) = 67 - 106 = -39. That's not helpful.\n\nWhat if I subtract some combination. Let's see: 53 is close to 46. Maybe 53 - 46 = 7. Then 7 + 7 =14? Wait, but we can only use each number once. So 53 -46 is 7, but then we have to use 7 again. Wait, that's a problem because 7 is already used once. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe combine 46 and 53. 46 +53 =99. Then subtract 7: 99 -7=92. Not 67. Or 53 -46=7, then 7* something? But we need to use all numbers. So maybe 53 -46 =7, and then 7* (something) to get 67. But we already used 46,53,7. The remaining number is 67. But we can't use 67 again. Wait, no, because all numbers must be used once. So perhaps that approach isn't working.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe group numbers. For example, (46 + 7) =53. Then 53 + something? But then we have 53 + (67 -53)=67? Wait, but we can only use each number once. Let me check that. If I do (46 +7) =53, but that's using 46 and 7. Then we have 53 and 67 left. So the equation would be (46 +7) + (67 -53). But that's 53 +14=67. Wait, that's 53 +14=67. Let me check: 53 +14 is indeed 67. But how to express this with the given numbers. Let's see:\n\n(46 +7) + (67 -53) = 53 +14=67. But here, 46,7,67,53 are all used once. So the equation would be (46 +7) + (67 -53) =67. But wait, the left side is (46+7) which is 53, plus (67-53) which is 14, so 53+14=67. Yes, that works. But does this equation use all numbers once? Let's check: 46,7,67,53—yes, all are used once. So the equation would be (46 + 7) + (67 - 53) =67. But in the problem statement, they just need an equation that equals 67, using all numbers with each used once. So the left side would be (46 +7) + (67 -53) which equals 53 +14=67. That works. Let me verify again:\n\n46 +7 =53.\n\n67 -53=14.\n\n53 +14=67.\n\nYes. So combining them as (46 +7) + (67 -53) =67. That uses all four numbers, each once, with addition and subtraction. So that should be the answer. Let me check if there's any other possible combination, but this seems to work. Alternatively, maybe another way? Let's think. For example, 67 multiplied by something? But 67 is already part of the target. Let's see. If I use multiplication or division. For example, 53 + (7 * something). 53 + 14=67. 14 could be 7*2, but 2 isn't one of our numbers. So that might not work. Alternatively, 46 + 7 + (67 -53) =46+7=53, 53 +14=67. Which is the same as before. So the equation (46 +7) + (67 -53) is correct. Let me write it properly with parentheses. The user probably wants the equation in a single line. So (46 + 7) + (67 - 53) =67. But in the example, it's like (1+2)/3, so the answer is the left-hand side. So the answer would be (46 + 7) + (67 - 53). Let me check the arithmetic again. 46+7=53. 67-53=14. 53+14=67. Correct. So the equation is correct and uses all numbers once. Therefore, that's the solution.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(46 + 7) + (67 - 53) = 67</answer>"}]}

The remaining numbers are 48, 51, and 10. Hmm, 51 minus 48 is 3, and 10 divided by something... Wait, maybe 10 divided by (51 minus 48) is 10/3, which is about 3.333. That doesn't give me 7.\n\nAlternatively, maybe combining 50 with another number. What if I subtract something from 50 multiplied by another number. For example, 50*10 is 500. Then 500 minus (48 + 51) is 500 - 99 = 401. Not quite 350. Hmm. Or maybe 51*10 is 510. Then 510 - (50 +48) is 510 -98=412. Still not there.\n\nWait, 350 is 50*7. So if I can get 7 from 48,51,10.

Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let me note that 579 is the target. I should start by considering the larger numbers to see if they can be combined in a way that gets close to 579. The largest number here is 517, which is already pretty close to 579. The difference between 517 and 579 is 62. So maybe I can add something to 517 to reach 579. Let's see: 579 - 517 = 62. Do I have numbers that can make 62? The numbers left would be 40, 20, 31. Let me check: 40 + 20 = 60, which is 2 short. 31 + 40 = 71, which is 9 over. Hmm, maybe subtract something? For example, 40 + 31 - 20 = 51. Not enough. Alternatively, 40 * something. Wait, 40 * 1.55 is 62, but I can't use fractions. Maybe 31 * 2 is 62, but I don't have a 2. Wait, but I can use 20 divided by something. Let me think differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can multiply some numbers. For instance, 40 multiplied by 20 is 800. That's way too big. But 517 + 40 is 557, then adding 20 gives 577, which is 2 less than 579. Then adding 31 would be over. Hmm. Not quite. Wait, 557 + 20 = 577, then 577 + 31 is 608. That's too much. Alternatively, 517 + (40 * 20) would be 517 + 800 = 1317, way over.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe subtract something from a larger product. For example, 40 * 20 = 800. Then 800 - 517 = 283. Still not helpful. Then using 31, but how? 283 +31=314. Not useful. Hmm.\n\nWait, let's see. What if I take 517 and add 40. That's 557. Then I need 22 more to reach 579. The remaining numbers are 20 and 31. How can I get 22 from 20 and 31? 31 - 20 =11, but that's not 22. Or maybe 20 + (31/ something). If I divide 31 by 1, but that's just 31. Not helpful. Alternatively, 31 - (20 / something). Not sure.\n\nWhat if I use multiplication or division with the other numbers. Let's see. For example, 40 * 31 = 1240. Then 1240 - 517 = 723. Still too big. Then subtract 20: 723 -20=703. No. Not useful.\n\nWait, maybe combine 20 and 31 first. 20 +31=51. Then 517 +51=568. Then 568 +40=608. Too much. Alternatively, 517 + (20 +40)=577. Then 577 +31=608 again. Not helpful.\n\nHmm. Let's try a different approach. Let's see if we can multiply two numbers and then add or subtract. For instance, 31 *20=620. Then 620 -40=580. Close to 579. Then 580 -1=579, but I don't have a 1. But I have 517 left. Wait, maybe 517 is used in another part. Wait, we have to use all numbers. So 31 and 20 are used in 31*20=620. Then subtract 40 to get 580. Then subtract 1 from 517? But 517 hasn't been used yet. Wait, but we have to use all numbers. So maybe 517 + (something) but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 517 + (40 - (20 * something)) +31. Let me check. For example, 40 - (20 * x) +31. Let's see, if x is 1, then 40 -20 +31=51. Then 517 +51=568. Not enough. If x is 0.5, but we can't use fractions. Alternatively, 20 divided by something. 20 divided by 31 is less than 1. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe 517 + (40 * (31 -20)). Let's calculate: 31-20=11. Then 40*11=440. 517+440=957. That's way over.\n\nAlternatively, 517 + 40 * (31 -20/ something). Let's see, 20 divided by a number. If I use 20 divided by 10, but I don't have a 10. Wait, maybe 20 divided by 31, but that's a fraction. Hmm.\n\nAnother idea: Use division to get a higher number. For example, 40 divided by 20 is 2. Then 31 *2=62. Then 517 +62=579. Oh! Wait, that might work. Let me check:\n\nIf I do 40 /20 =2, then 31*2=62. Then 517 +62=579. But does that use all numbers? Let's see: 517 is used, 40 and 20 are used in 40/20, and 31 is used in 31*2. So yes, all numbers are used once. So the equation would be 517 + (31 * (40 /20)) = 517 + (31*2) = 517 +62=579. That works! Let me verify:\n\n40 divided by 20 is 2. Multiply that by 31 gives 62. Add to 517: 517 +62=579. Yes! And all numbers are used once: 517, 40, 20, 31.

I need to use the numbers 25, 100, 100, 80 each exactly once, and combine them with basic arithmetic operations to get 220. Hmm, where do I start?\n\nFirst, maybe I should try some addition. Let's add them all up: 25 + 100 + 100 + 80. That's 25 + 100 is 125, plus another 100 is 225, then plus 80 gives 305. That's way too high. So adding all of them isn't the way. Maybe subtract some numbers instead.\n\nWhat if I subtract 25 from something? Let's see. If I take 100 and 100, adding those gives 200. Then add 80 to get 280. Subtract 25: 280 -25 = 255. Still not 220. Hmm. Maybe a different combination.\n\nWait, maybe use multiplication. If I multiply 25 by something. Let's see. 25 * 100 is 2500, which is way too big. Maybe 100 divided by 25 is 4. Then 4 times 80 is 320, but then how to use the other 100? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe subtract two numbers. Let's say 100 - 25 =75. Then 80 + 100 =180. 75 +180=255 again. No. Not helpful.\n\nWait, what if I use division to reduce a larger number. For example, 100 /25 =4. Then 4*80=320. Then subtract 100: 320 -100=220. Oh! Wait, that uses all the numbers: 100 divided by 25 is 4, multiplied by 80 is 320, then subtract the remaining 100. Let's check:\n\n100 /25 =4; 4 *80 =320; 320 -100 =220. Yes! So that's 100/25*80 -100. Let me make sure all numbers are used once: 100,25,80,100. Wait, but there are two 100s. Oh right, the original numbers are 25, 100, 100, 80. So in this equation, we used both 100s. So that works. Let me verify again:\n\n100 divided by 25 is 4. Multiply by 80 gives 320. Subtract the other 100 gives 220. Yes, that uses all four numbers once each. So the equation would be (100 / 25) * 80 - 100 = 220. Let me check if parentheses are necessary. Without them, it would be 100 /25*80 which is 4*80=320, same as with parentheses. So maybe the equation is 100/25*80 -100 =220. But to make it clearer, maybe write it as ((100 / 25) * 80) - 100 =220. Either way, the numbers are all used once. That should be the solution.\n</think>\n\n<answer>((100 / 25) * 80) - 100 = 220</answer>"}]}

I need to use all the numbers 16, 94, 53, and 91 exactly once each with basic arithmetic operations to get 896. Hmm. Let me start by thinking about the target number 896. Maybe breaking it down into factors could help. Let's see, 896 divided by 16 is 56. Oh, wait, 16 is one of the numbers, so maybe 16 multiplied by something else. But 56 isn't one of the numbers. Alternatively, 896 divided by 53 is approximately 16.9, which isn't helpful. What about 94? 94 times 9.53... Hmm, not directly obvious.\n\nAlternatively, maybe combining some of the larger numbers first. For example, 94 and 91 are both large. If I subtract them, 94 - 91 = 3, but that seems small. If I add them, 94 + 91 = 185. Then maybe multiply by something. Let's see, 185 * 53 = ... 185*50=9250, 185*3=555, total 9805, which is way too big. Hmm. Maybe that's not the way.\n\nWhat if I multiply two numbers first? Let's try 94 * 53. Let me calculate that. 94*50=4700, 94*3=282, so total 4982. Then subtract or add the other numbers. 4982 + 16 + 91 = 4982 + 107 = 5089. Not close. If I subtract 16 and 91, that's 4982 - 107 = 4875. Still not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe (94 + 53) * something? 94+53=147. 147 times what? Let's see 147 * 6 = 882, which is close to 896. 882 +14=896. But how to get 6 and 14 from remaining numbers. The remaining numbers would be 16 and 91. Hmm. 16 - (91/ something). Maybe 91 divided by 13 is 7, but we don't have 13. Alternatively, 16 - (91/7) = 16 - 13 = 3. Not helpful. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, 147 * 6.09... maybe. Not helpful. Maybe trying a different approach.\n\nWhat about 91 * 16? Let's calculate that. 90*16=1440, plus 1*16=16, total 1456. Then subtract 94 and 53. 1456 - 94 = 1362, 1362 -53=1309. Not 896. Alternatively, 91 * 16 =1456. If we subtract 94*53, which is 4982, that would be 1456 -4982 = negative number. Not helpful.\n\nHmm. Maybe combining 53 and 16. 53+16=69. 69*13=897, which is close to 896. But 13 isn't there. 91 divided by 7 is 13, but 7 isn't a number. Alternatively, 91-94= -3. Not sure.\n\nWait, what if I do 94 - 53 = 41. Then 41 * something. 41*22=902. Close to 896. But how to get 22. Maybe using 91 and 16. 91 -16=75. Not helpful. 91/16 is about 5.69. 41 * 5.69 = around 233. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 94 * 91. Let's see: 94*90=8460, plus 94=8554. That's way too big. 8554 divided by something. If we divide by 53, 8554 /53 is around 161.4. Then subtract 16? 161.4 -16=145.4. Not helpful.\n\nHmm. Maybe 53*16=848. Then 848 + something. 848 + 48 =896. So I need 48 from 94 and 91. How? 94 - 91=3. 3*16=48, but I already used 16. Wait, no, 16 is already used in 53*16. So can't use it again. Alternatively, 94 - (91 - something). Wait, maybe 94 - (91 - x) where x is from other numbers. But other numbers are 53 and 16. Maybe 94 - (91 -53) = 94 -38=56. Then 56*16=896. Oh! Wait, that could work. Let's check.\n\nSo, 94 - (91 -53) = 94 -38=56. Then multiply by 16: 56*16=896. But wait, we have to use all four numbers. Let me see which numbers are used here. 94, 91, 53, and 16. Yes! All four. So the equation would be (94 - (91 -53)) *16. Let's compute that step by step: 91-53=38. 94-38=56. 56*16=896. Yes! That works. So the equation is (94 - (91 - 53)) * 16 = 896.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(94 - (91 - 53)) * 16 = 896</answer>"}]}

Since 1 is a small number, perhaps division or subtraction would be useful here.\n\nLet me list out the numbers: 94, 166, 4, 68. Let's see if there are any obvious relationships between them. For example, 68 divided by 4 is 17, which might be useful. 166 minus 94 is 72. Not sure if that helps. Alternatively, 166 divided by something? 166 divided by 83 is 2, but I don't have 83.

For example, maybe (something) - (something else) = 1. Or maybe a division where the result is 1, which would require the numerator and denominator to be equal. But how to make them equal using all four numbers.\n\nAlternatively, combining some numbers with multiplication and division. Let's try combinations:\n\nIf I use 166 and 94, maybe subtract them: 166 - 94 = 72. Then 72 divided by something. But I have 68 and 4 left. If I use 68 and 4, 68 /4 = 17. Then 72 /17 is not an integer, but maybe 72 - (68/4) = 72 -17 = 55. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe (166 - 94) divided by (68 +4). That would be 72 /72 =1. Oh, that's interesting! Let's check:\n\n166 minus 94 is 72. 68 plus 4 is 72. So (166 -94)/(68 +4) =72/72=1. But wait, that uses all four numbers: 166, 94, 68, 4. Each exactly once. And all operations are allowed.

Let me start by thinking about how these numbers can combine to get close to 451.\n\nFirst, 451 is a relatively large number, so maybe multiplication will be necessary. Let me check the largest numbers here: 48 and 35. Multiplying them gives 48*35=1680, which is way too big. But maybe if I subtract something from that product. Let's see: 1680 minus other numbers. The remaining numbers are 28 and 11. 1680 - 28 -11 = 1641. That's still way over. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe combining 48 and 28. 48+28=76. 76* something? 76*5=380, which is still under 451. But 76*6=456, which is close. Hmm, 456 is 5 more than 451. So if I can get 76*6 -5, but how do the other numbers fit in here? Wait, maybe 48 + 28 = 76. Then 76 multiplied by... Let's see. 35 and 11 left. If I take 35 -11=24, then 76*24=1824. That's way too big. Not helpful.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe using division to reduce the numbers. For example, 48 divided by something. 48/11 is about 4.36. Then 4.36 multiplied by 35 is around 152.6, which is not helpful. Alternatively, 35 divided by 28 is about 1.25. 1.25 *48=60. 60 +11=71. Still too low.\n\nWhat if I try to make 451 by combining two large numbers and then adjust. 451 is close to 48*9.5. Let's see. How to get 9.5. Maybe 28 - (35/11). Let's check: 35/11 is approximately 3.18. 28 -3.18=24.82. Then 48*24.82=1191.36. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe reverse: 35*11=385. Then 385 + something. 385 +48=433, plus 28=461. That's 10 over. Hmm. But 433 +28 is 461. So 461-10=451. How to get that 10. Wait, but we have to use all numbers once. So maybe 35*11 +48 -28. Let's compute: 385 +48=433, 433-28=405. Not enough.\n\nAlternatively, 35*11=385. Then 385 + (48 -28)=385+20=405. Still the same. Not enough. Maybe 35* (11 + something). 11 + (48/28). Let's see: 48/28 is 1.714. So 11+1.714≈12.714. 35*12.714≈445. That's close. Then 445 + (remaining number?), but we already used 35, 11,48,28. Wait, maybe the division of 48/28 is part of the equation. So 35*(11 + (48/28)) = 35*(11 + 12/7) = 35*( (77 +12)/7 )=35*(89/7)= (35*89)/7=5*89=445. Then 445 plus... but we used all numbers. Wait, 48 is used in 48/28, 28 is used, 35 and 11. So all numbers are used. But 445 is 6 less than 451. So this approach gives 445, which is close but not there.\n\nHmm. Maybe another combination. Let's think of 28*16=448. Then 448 +3=451. How to get 16 and 3 from remaining numbers. If 28*16 +3=451. The remaining numbers would be 11,48,35. Let's see: 48 -35=13. 13-11=2. Not 3. Alternatively, 35 - (48/11)=35-4.36≈30.64. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 35 +11=46. 46* something. 46*9=414. 414 +28=442. 442 +48=490. No, that's over. Alternatively, 48*9=432. 432 + 28=460. 460 - (35-11)=460-24=436. Still not 451.\n\nWait, what about multiplying two numbers and then adding or subtracting the others. Let's see:\n\nLet me try 48*11=528. Then 528 -35=493. 493 -28=465. Still over. Alternatively, 528 - (35+28)=528-63=465. Still over.\n\nHow about 35*28=980. That's way too big. 980 -48=932. Still way over. Maybe 35*11=385. 48+28=76. 385+76=461. Close to 451. 461-10=451. But how to get 10 from the numbers already used? All numbers are used here (35,11,48,28). So that doesn't work.\n\nAnother idea: Let's use parentheses to combine operations. Maybe (48 - (35/11)) * something. 35/11≈3.18. 48 -3.18≈44.82. Then 44.82 *10=448.2, which is close. How to get 10. The remaining number is 28. So 44.82 * (28 - 18)=44.82*10. Wait, but we have to use 28. Alternatively, 44.82 * (28 / something). Let's see. 28 divided by what? If I use 28 as part of the multiplier. But we already used 35,11,48, and need to use 28. Hmm, maybe this is not the right path.\n\nWait, let's calculate (48 - (35/11)) * (28). Let's compute that: 35/11≈3.1818. 48-3.1818≈44.8182. Multiply by 28: 44.8182*28≈1255. No way, way over.\n\nAlternatively, (48 * 11) - (35 *28). 48*11=528, 35*28=980. 528-980= -452. Not helpful.\n\nAnother angle: Let's see if 451 can be factored. 451 ÷ 11=41. 41 is a prime. So 451=11*41. Hmm. So if we can get 41 from 48,35,28. Let's see: 48 - (35-28)=48-7=41. Then 11*(48 - (35-28))=11*(48-7)=11*41=451. Wait, that works! Let's check:\n\nNumbers used: 11,48,35,28. Each used once. Operations: subtract within the parentheses and multiply. Let me write it out step by step.\n\nFirst, 35-28=7. Then 48-7=41. Then 11*41=451. So the equation is 11*(48 - (35 -28)) =451. Let me verify the calculation:\n\n35 -28=7. 48-7=41. 11*41=451. Yes, that's correct. All numbers used once, operations are subtraction and multiplication.

If I subtract something from 97, maybe. But 97 minus 94 would be 3, which seems too small. Alternatively, 97 plus 94 is 191, which is still less than 274. Then adding 65 would get us to 256, still not enough. Then adding 18 would make it 274. Wait, wait, 97 + 94 = 191, 191 + 65 = 256, 256 + 18 = 274. Oh! Wait, that would just be adding all the numbers. Let me check: 94 + 97 + 65 + 18. Let's compute that. 94 + 97 is 191. 191 + 65 is 256. 256 +18 is 274. Oh! That works! But wait, the problem says \"using each number only once and all the numbers\". So adding all of them: 94 + 97 + 65 + 18 = 274. Is that correct? Let me verify the sum again. 94 +97: 94+90=184, +7=191. 191+65: 191+60=251, +5=256. 256+18: 256+10=266, +8=274. Yes, that adds up. So the equation is simply 94 + 97 + 65 + 18 = 274. But wait, the example in the problem uses parentheses and operations, but maybe here it's just addition. But the problem allows using operations multiple times. So if I can just add them all, that would be the simplest solution. Let me check if the numbers are all used once and required operations.

I need to make an equation using all the numbers 702, 45, 16, and 34 exactly once, and the result should be 52. Hmm. Let me start by thinking about what operations might get me close.\n\nFirst, 52 is a relatively small number compared to 702 and 45, so maybe I need to subtract or divide some of the larger numbers. Let's jot down the numbers: 702, 45, 16, 34. All must be used once with basic operations.\n\nLet me try breaking it down. If I could get 702 divided by something to make a smaller number. 702 divided by, say, 13.5 would be 52, but 13.5 isn't one of the numbers. Wait, but maybe combining numbers through operations can get me 13.5. Let's see: 45 minus 34 is 11, which is too small. 16 plus 34 is 50, which is close. 45 divided by something? 45 divided by 3 is 15. But 3 isn't here. Maybe 45 minus (16 / something)? Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe subtract some numbers. If I take 45 and 34, subtract them from 702. Let's try that: 702 - 45 = 657; 657 - 34 = 623. That's way too big. Then subtract 16 as well? 623 -16 = 607. Still not 52. So that approach isn't working.\n\nWhat if I use division or multiplication to reduce the larger numbers. Let's think: 702 divided by something. If I can get 702 divided by a number to make 52, then 702 / x =52 → x=702/52=13.5. But 13.5 isn't directly available. Can I combine the other numbers to get 13.5? Let's see: 45 divided by 34 is roughly 1.32, which isn't helpful. 45 minus 34 is 11. 16 divided by something... Maybe 45 - (34 /16)? 34/16 is 2.125, so 45 -2.125=42.875. Then 702 divided by 42.875 is about 16.37, which isn't helpful. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe multiply some numbers. If I take 45 and 16, 45*16=720. Then subtract 702? 720-702=18. Then add 34? 18+34=52. Wait, that seems possible. Let me check: (45*16) -702 +34. But wait, I need to use all numbers once. So 45*16 uses 45 and 16. Then subtract 702 uses 702, and add 34 uses 34. So that's all four numbers. Let's compute the value:\n\n45*16 = 720\n\n720 -702 = 18\n\n18 +34 =52. Yes! That works. So the equation would be (45 × 16) - 702 + 34 = 52. But wait, according to order of operations, multiplication comes first, so maybe parentheses aren't needed around 45×16. Let me check: 45*16 -702 +34. Without parentheses, it's (45*16) -702 +34 = 720 -702 +34 = 18 +34=52. So that works. But the problem states to create an equation, so all numbers must be used once. Let me verify: 45,16,702,34. Yes, all used once. So the equation is 45*16 -702 +34 =52. But maybe the problem expects the equation to have all numbers connected through operations, but I think as written, this is valid. Alternatively, perhaps we need to arrange them with operations between each, but the problem allows using operations multiple times as long as each number is used once. So this should be acceptable.\n\nWait, but the example given in the problem uses parentheses, like (1+2)/3. Maybe the solution here can be written with parentheses to group operations. Let me re-express it as (45 * 16) - 702 + 34. But since multiplication is done first, the parentheses aren't necessary, but including them might make it clearer. Alternatively, maybe there's another way. Let me think if there's another combination.\n\nAnother approach: 34 + 16 =50. Then we need 2 more. 702 divided by something gives 2. 702/351=2. How to get 351 from 45 and the others? Wait, 45 is left. 45* something. 45*7.8=351. But we don't have 7.8. Alternatively, 45 + 34 +16=95. 702/95 is about 7.38. Not helpful.\n\nHmm, perhaps subtract 45 from 702 first: 702-45=657. Then 657 divided by something. 657 divided by 12.63 is about 52. But 12.63 isn't there. 34-16=18. 657/18=36.5. Not 52.\n\nAlternatively, 702 divided by (34 -16). 34-16=18. 702/18=39. Then 39 +45=84. Not 52.\n\nWait, another idea: (702 - (45*16)) +34. Wait, 45*16=720. 702-720= -18. Then -18 +34=16. No, that's 16, not 52. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe 702 divided by something minus another number. Let's try: 702/(34-16) -45. 34-16=18. 702/18=39. 39-45= -6. Not 52.\n\nAlternatively, 702/(45 - something). Let's see, 45 -16=29. 702/29≈24.2. Then 24.2 +34≈58.2. Close but not 52.\n\nHow about 34 * (something). 34*1.529≈52. Hmm. Maybe 34*( (702-45)/16 ). Let's compute 702-45=657. 657/16≈41.0625. 34*41.0625≈1396.125. Way too big.\n\nAlternatively, (45 - (702 / 34)) *16. Let's compute 702/34≈20.647. 45-20.647≈24.353. Multiply by16≈389.65. Not close.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe 45 -34=11. Then 11*16=176. 702 -176=526. Not 52. Wait, 526 divided by 10.13 is 52. But 10.13 isn't available.\n\nWait, perhaps 702 divided by (45 - (34 -16)). Let's compute 34-16=18. 45-18=27. 702/27=26. Then 26 + something? But I've already used all numbers except maybe 26 is part of the equation. Wait, but in this case, the numbers used would be 702,45,34,16. But the operations here would be 702 / (45 - (34 -16)) = 702/(45-18)=702/27=26. Then I need to get 52 from that. But 26*2=52. But I don't have a 2. Unless I can use another operation. But all numbers must be used once, and I've already used them all in the division. So that approach doesn't work.\n\nWait, let's get back to the earlier idea where 45*16=720, 720-702=18, 18+34=52. That seems to work. Let me check again: 45 multiplied by 16 is 720, subtract 702 gives 18, add 34 gives 52. Yes. And all numbers are used once: 45,16,702,34. So the equation is 45*16 -702 +34 =52. That should be the correct answer.\n</think>\n\n<answer>45 * 16 - 702 + 34 = 52</answer>"}]}

Let me start by thinking about the target number 202. Hmm, 202 is a bit over 200, so maybe I need to combine some of the larger numbers first.\n\nLooking at the numbers given, 98 is the largest. If I can use 98 in a way that contributes significantly, that might help. Let's see. Maybe multiply 98 by something? 98 times 2 is 196, which is close to 200, but how do I get a 2 from the remaining numbers? I have 24, 6, and 12 left. Wait, 24 divided by 12 is 2. So 98 multiplied by (24/12) would be 98*2=196. Then, adding the remaining 6 would give 196+6=202. Wait, does that work?\n\nLet me check: 24 divided by 12 is 2. Then 98 times 2 is 196. Then 196 plus 6 is 202. Yes! So the equation would be 98 * (24 / 12) + 6 = 202. Let me verify each step. 24 divided by 12 is indeed 2. 98 times 2 is 196. Adding 6 gives exactly 202. And all numbers are used once: 24, 12, 98, and 6. Perfect. I think that's the solution. Let me just make sure there's no other way, but this seems straightforward. No other combinations come to mind immediately. For example, if I tried subtracting instead, but 98 is big, and the others are smaller. Alternatively, maybe 24* something. 24*8=192, which is 10 away, but getting 8 from 6, 98, and 12... Not sure. 98-12=86, 86/6 is not an integer. So that might not work. Alternatively, 12*6=72, 98+72=170, 24 left. 170+24=194. Not enough. Or 98+24=122, then 12*6=72, 122+72=194 again. Hmm. Another approach: 98 + 6 = 104, 24*12=288. Then 288 - 104=184. Not 202. How about 24*6=144, 98+144=242, then 242 -12=230. Still not. Alternatively, 98*6=588. Then with 24 and 12. 588 - (24 +12)=588-36=552. Way off. Maybe division. 98 divided by 6 is around 16, then multiplied by 24 is 16*24=384. Subtract 12? 384-12=372. Not helpful. So the initial idea seems the best. Let me recheck: 24/12=2; 98*2=196; 196+6=202. All numbers used once. Yep, that's the one.\n</think>\n\n<answer>98 * (24 / 12) + 6 = 202</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using all the numbers 82, 82, 14, 846 exactly once, and the result should be 860. The allowed operations are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Hmm.\n\nFirst, let me note the target is 860. Let's look at the numbers provided. There's 846, which is quite large. Then there are two 82s and 14. Since 846 is close to 860, maybe I can adjust it by adding or subtracting the other numbers. Let's check:\n\n846 + 14 = 860. Oh, wait, that's exactly 860! But wait, I have two 82s left. But the problem states that I need to use all numbers exactly once. So just 846 + 14 would use only two numbers, leaving the two 82s unused. That won't work.\n\nSo I need to involve all four numbers. Let's think again. Maybe subtract something from 846 or add to it using the other numbers. Let's see:\n\nIf I take 846 and subtract one of the 82s, that gives 846 - 82 = 764. Then maybe add the other 82 and 14. 764 + 82 = 846 again, then +14 would be 860. Wait, that might work. Let me check:\n\n846 - 82 + 82 + 14. But wait, that uses 846, subtracts 82, then adds the same 82 back, which cancels out, leaving 846 +14 = 860. But the problem states each number can be used only once. So using 82 twice here: subtracting one 82 and adding the other 82. Since there are two 82s, each can be used once. So maybe that's allowed. Let me verify:\n\nThe equation would be 846 - 82 + 82 +14. Since the two 82s are separate numbers, each used once, that's okay. So that adds up to 846 +14 = 860. The 82s cancel each other out. That works. But let me check if that's allowed. The problem says each number can be used once, so using both 82s once each in subtraction and addition is acceptable. Then the equation would be (846 - 82) + 82 +14. Which is 846 +14 + ( -82 +82 ) = 860 +0=860. Yes, that works.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way. Let me see if there's another combination. For example, multiplying the 82s. 82 * 82 is a large number, 6724. That's way bigger than 860, so probably not helpful. Let's see: 82 +82 = 164. Then 846 -164 = 682, plus 14 is 696. Not close. Alternatively, 846 divided by something. 846 /14 is approximately 60.428... Not sure. If I do 82 * (846 /14) that would be a big number. Probably not useful.\n\nAlternatively, 82 +82 =164. 846 -164=682. Then 682 +14=696. Still not. Hmm.\n\nWait, another approach: 82 *14= 1148. Then 846 + (82 - 1148). Wait, that's 846 +82 -1148. Which is 928 -1148= -220. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 846 - (82 +82) +14. That's 846 -164 +14= 846 -150=696. No.\n\nWait, going back to the first idea. If I use 846 +14=860, and then the two 82s can be arranged to cancel each other. So 846 +14 +82 -82. That's 860 +0. So the equation would be 846 +14 +82 -82. Each number is used once. Yes. The two 82s are subtracted and added, each used once. So that works. Let me check the order, but as long as all numbers are used once. So the equation could be written as 846 +14 +82 -82 =860. Alternatively, (846 +14) + (82 -82). Either way, the result is 860. That should be acceptable. So the equation is 846 +14 +82 -82 =860. Simplifying, the 82s cancel out.

I need to create an equation using the numbers 9, 12, 20, and 9, each exactly once, and the result should be 135. The operations allowed are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Hmm, how can I combine these numbers to get 135?\n\nFirst, let me think about the target number, 135. Breaking it down, 135 is 9 multiplied by 15. Or maybe 12 times something? 12 times 11.25 is 135, but that might be harder. Alternatively, 20 times 6.75 is 135, but again, fractions could complicate things. Maybe using multiplication of larger numbers and then adding or subtracting.\n\nLet me list the numbers again: 9, 12, 20, and 9. I have two 9s. Wait, but each number can be used once. Oh, but in the problem statement, the numbers given are 9, 12, 20, 9. So there are two 9s, but each can be used once. So I have to use both 9s. So I need to use both 9s, 12, and 20 once each. That might help.\n\nSo maybe I can multiply two of them to get a larger number. Let's see. Let's try combinations.\n\nFor example, 20 times 12 is 240. If I subtract something from that, maybe 240 minus something equals 135. Let's see: 240 - 105 = 135. Can I make 105 with the remaining numbers, which are 9 and 9? 9 + 9 is 18, which is way less. 9 * 9 is 81. 240 - 81 = 159, which is too high. Hmm, not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe adding 20 and 12 first. 20 +12=32. Then 32 multiplied by something. 32*4.21875=135. Not sure. But with the two 9s, maybe 9 divided by 9 is 1. Then 32*1=32, not helpful.\n\nWhat if I multiply the two 9s first? 9*9=81. Then, 81 plus something. 135-81=54. Can I get 54 from 20 and 12? 20 +12=32. 20*12=240. 20-12=8. 20/12≈1.666. Not 54. Alternatively, 12* (20 - something). Wait, 12*4.5=54. But 4.5 can be from 9/2, but I don't have a 2. Hmm.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe using division to get a higher number. For example, 135 divided by 9 is 15. So if I can get 15 from 12, 20, and the other 9. Let's see. 20 - (12 - 9) = 20 - 3 =17. Not 15. 12 + (20 / something). 20 / (9/ something). Wait, 20 divided by (something) plus 12? Let's see. If I have 20 divided by (9/9), that's 20 divided by 1, which is 20. Then 20 +12=32. Then 32*9=288. No, that uses all numbers but not getting 135.\n\nWait, let's try (20 - (12 / 9)) * 9. Let's compute that. 12 divided by 9 is approximately 1.333. 20 -1.333=18.666. Multiply by 9 is 168. Close but not 135.\n\nAlternatively, (12 + 9) * (20 -9). 21*11=231. No. Not close.\n\nWait, 135 is 9*15. So maybe 9*(something that equals 15 using 12,20, and the other 9). Let's see: 20 - (12 - 9) =17. No. 12 + (20 / something). 20 divided by (9/9) is 20. 12 +20=32. 32*9=288. Not helpful.\n\nHmm. Another angle: 20 * 9 = 180. Then, 180 minus something. 180 -45=135. Can I get 45 from 12 and 9? 12*3.75=45, but 3.75 is 15/4. Not sure. Alternatively, 9*(12 - something). 12 - (something)=5. So 9*5=45. Then that something would be 7. How? 20? Wait, the numbers left would be 12 and 9. Hmm, perhaps 12 - (9/ something). But I already used 9 in the multiplication. Wait, maybe not. Let me rephrase.\n\nIf I do 20*9=180. Then subtract (12* (9/ something)). Wait, but we need to use all numbers. So if I use 20*9, then have 12 and 9 left. Maybe 180 - (12 * (9 / something)). Wait, but I can't use division here without using another number. Alternatively, 180 - (12 +9)= 180-21=159. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe (20 - (9/9)) *12. Let's compute: 9/9=1. 20-1=19. 19*12=228. No.\n\nOr 20*(12 - (9/9)). 9/9=1, 12-1=11. 20*11=220. Not 135.\n\nHmm. What if I multiply 12 and 9 first. 12*9=108. Then, 108 + something=135. 135-108=27. Can I get 27 from 20 and 9? 20 +9=29. Close. 9+20=29, which is 2 more than 27. Not helpful. 20 + (9/ something). But 9 divided by what? Only numbers left are the other 9 and 20. Wait, I already used 12 and 9. Maybe 20/ something. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, (12 * 9) + (20 -9). That would be 108 +11=119. Not 135.\n\nWait, maybe using division to get a multiplier. For example, (20 / something) multiplied by others. Let's see. If I do (20 / (12 -9)) *9. 12-9=3, so 20/3≈6.666. Multiply by 9≈60. Not enough.\n\nAlternatively, ((20 +9) * (12 -9)). 29*3=87. No.\n\nWait, maybe (9 + 9) * (20 -12). 18*8=144. Close to 135 but over.\n\nHmm. Another approach: 135 is 5*27. 5 can be from 20/4, but where to get 4? Maybe 12 - 9=3. Not 4. Alternatively, 9 - (20/12). But that's messy.\n\nWait, maybe 12*20=240. Then 240 - (9*9)=240-81=159. Not helpful.\n\nWait, 135 divided by 9 is 15. So if I can make 15 from the other numbers. 12 + (20 -9) =12+11=23. No. 20 - (12 -9)=17. No. 20/(12/9)=20/(4/3)=15. Oh! Wait, 12 divided by 9 is 4/3. Then 20 divided by (4/3) is 15. Then 15 *9=135. Let me check that.\n\nSo 20 divided by (12/9) equals 15. Then 15 multiplied by 9 is 135. Let me write that as 20 ÷ (12 ÷9) *9. Wait, but we have to use all numbers once. Let's see:\n\nNumbers used: 20, 12,9,9. Yes, each once. So (20 / (12 /9)) *9. Let's compute the parentheses first. 12/9=1.333... Then 20 divided by that is 15. Then 15*9=135. That works!\n\nSo the equation would be (20 / (12 / 9)) *9. Let me check the order of operations. Division and multiplication from left to right. So 12 divided by 9 is 1.333..., then 20 divided by that is 15, then multiplied by 9 gives 135. Yes. That works and uses all numbers once.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(20 / (12 / 9)) * 9</answer>"}]}

Each number has to be used exactly once, and I can use basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Let me start by thinking about how these numbers can combine.\n\nFirst, let me list out the numbers again: 341, 28, 39, 97. Hmm. 341 is the largest number here, so maybe subtracting some combination of the others from it could work? Let's see. If I subtract 28, 39, and 97 from 341, that would be 341 - 28 - 39 - 97. Let me calculate that: 341 minus 28 is 313. Then 313 minus 39 is 274. Then 274 minus 97 is 177. Wait, that actually works! But wait, the problem says I need to use all the numbers in an equation with operations. If I just subtract them all, is that allowed? Let me check the rules again.\n\nThe instructions say each number can only be used once and you must use all the numbers. So, using subtraction multiple times is allowed as long as each number is used once. So 341 - 28 - 39 - 97 equals 177. Let me verify the arithmetic again to be sure. 341 minus 28 is 313. Then 313 minus 39 is 274. Then 274 minus 97 is indeed 177. So that would be the equation: 341 - 28 - 39 - 97 = 177. But the problem wants the equation in a single line, using operations, so maybe we need to group them with parentheses or operations. Wait, but subtraction is left-associative, so 341 - 28 - 39 - 97 is the same as (((341 - 28) - 39) - 97), which is correct. So the equation would be 341 - 28 - 39 - 97 = 177. Does that use all numbers once? Yes. Each number is used exactly once. So that's a valid answer. \n\nBut maybe there's another way, but this seems straightforward. Let me check if there are alternative solutions in case I made a mistake here. Let's see. Maybe combining some numbers with multiplication or division first. For example, 28 and 39: 28 * 39 is 1092, which is way too big. 39 divided by 28 is about 1.39, not helpful. 341 divided by 97 is about 3.515. Hmm. Maybe 341/97 = 3.515, then multiply by something. Let's see: 3.515 * 28 is about 98.42. Then add 39: 98.42 +39≈137.42. No, that's not 177. \n\nAnother approach: 97 + 28 = 125. 125 + 39 = 164. 341 - 164 = 177. Wait, that's the same as before. So 341 - (97 + 28 + 39) = 177. But that's equivalent to 341 - 97 -28 -39. So either way, same result. Since addition is commutative and associative, grouping them as sums first and then subtracting once would be another way to write it, but since all operations are subtraction, it's the same. \n\nSo the equation can be written as 341 - 28 - 39 - 97 = 177, which works. Alternatively, 341 - (28 + 39 + 97) = 177. Let me check if that's allowed. The problem doesn't specify whether parentheses are allowed, but in the example they used parentheses. So either form is acceptable. Let's confirm the arithmetic again for the grouped version: 28 + 39 is 67, then 67 +97 is 164. 341 -164 is indeed 177. So that's another way to write it, but uses parentheses. Since the example includes parentheses, maybe that's the preferred way. \n\nSo possible equations are either 341 - 28 - 39 - 97 =177 or 341 - (28 + 39 + 97) =177. Both are correct and use each number once. The question allows using operations multiple times, so the first version is fine. But maybe the second one is more concise. Let me check if the problem requires the minimal use of operations or just any. Since either is acceptable, either would work. \n\nAlternatively, could there be another equation using multiplication or division? Let's see. Let me try 341 - (97 - 28) * (39 / something). Hmm, that seems complicated. For example, 97 -28 is 69. Then 39 divided by something. Not sure. Alternatively, 28 * 39 is 1092. 1092 divided by something. 341 - (1092 / 97). Let me calculate 1092 ÷ 97. 97*11=1067, so 1092-1067=25, so 11 + 25/97 ≈11.257. Then 341 -11.257≈329.743, which is not 177. So that doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 97 + 39 = 136. 341 -136 =205. Then 205 -28=177. So that would be 341 - (97 +39) -28 =177. Which is similar to previous equations. So again, same result.\n\nAnother idea: 341 divided by something. For example, 341 / 97 is approximately 3.515. Then multiply by 39: 3.515 *39≈137.09. Then add 28: 137.09 +28≈165.09. Not 177. Not helpful.\n\nWhat if we do 28 + 39 =67, then 97 +67=164. 341 -164=177. Same as before. So all these paths lead to the same equation. So the conclusion is that the equation must be 341 minus the sum of the other three numbers, which gives 177. Thus, the equation is either 341 -28 -39 -97 =177 or 341 - (28 +39 +97)=177. Both are correct. Since the example provided uses parentheses, perhaps the second form is preferred. So I'll go with that.\n</think>\n\n<answer>341 - (28 + 39 + 97) = 177</answer>"}]}

Maybe I can break it down into parts that relate to the numbers I have.\n\nFirst, 48 is the largest number here. If I multiply it by something, maybe that could get close. Let's check: 48 multiplied by 11 is 528, which is still less than 559. Wait, 48*12 is 576, which is a bit over. So maybe 48*11.645... Hmm, but fractions might complicate things. Let me see if I can combine other numbers to get 11 or 12. For instance, 23 minus 7 is 16. If I use 16, then 48*16 would be way too big. Maybe adding instead: 23 +7=30. 48*30 is 1440, which is way over. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe subtract 23 and 7. Wait, 23-7=16, then 48*16=768. Still not close. Maybe divide? 48 divided by something. Let's see, 48/(something) plus or minus others. Not sure. Let's think differently.\n\nWhat if I use multiplication and addition together? Let's say 23 is a big number. 23*24 is 552, which is very close to 559. Only 7 away. Hmm. Wait, 552 +7=559. But how to get 24 from 2 and 48? Wait, 48 divided by 2 is 24. Oh! So 23*(48/2) +7. Let me calculate that: 48 divided by 2 is 24. 24 times 23 is 552. 552 plus 7 is 559. That works! Let me check if all numbers are used once: 23, 48, 2 (used in 48/2), and 7. Yes, all four numbers.

Let me start by thinking about possible operations. Since 494 is a relatively large number, maybe multiplication will be involved. Let me try combining the larger numbers first.\n\n73 is the biggest. If I multiply 73 by something. Let's see, 73 times 6 is 438, 73*7 is 511, which is close to 494. But how can I get a 7 from the remaining numbers? The remaining numbers are 68, 65, and 50. Wait, 65 minus 50 is 15, which doesn't help. 68 minus 65 is 3, 50 divided by something... Not sure. Alternatively, maybe 68 + 65 = 133, but 73 times that would be way too big.\n\nAlternatively, maybe subtract two numbers to get a smaller value. Let's think about possible combinations. 73*65 would be way too big (over 4700). 68*73 is 68*70=4760 + 68*3=204, total 4964, which is way over. So multiplication of two large numbers isn't helpful. Maybe division? Like 73 divided by something, but that would give a fraction, which complicates things.\n\nWait, 494 is even. Let me check if it's divisible by any of the numbers. 494 divided by 68 is approximately 7.26. Not a whole number. 494 divided by 65 is about 7.6. 494 divided by 50 is 9.88. 494 divided by 73 is around 6.76. So maybe not directly.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about combining two numbers to get a value close to 494. For example, 68 + 65 = 133, which is too small. 73*6=438, and 494-438=56. Do I have 56 left? The remaining numbers would be 65 and 50, but 65 -50=15, which doesn't help. Alternatively, 73*7=511, which is 511-494=17. Maybe using 68-50=18, which is close, but not exactly 17.\n\nWait, maybe I need to use subtraction somewhere. Let me try another approach. Let's say I use 73 and 65. If I subtract them, 73-65=8. Then 8 multiplied by something. But 8*50=400, then adding 68 gives 468. Not enough. Hmm. Alternatively, 73-65=8, then 68*8=544. Then subtract 50: 544-50=494. Wait, that works! Let me check again.\n\nWait, 73 minus 65 is 8. Then 68 multiplied by 8 is 544. Then subtract 50: 544 - 50 = 494. Yes! But let's verify all numbers are used once: 73, 65, 68, and 50. Yes, all four numbers are used. So the equation would be (73 - 65) * 68 - 50 = 494. Let me compute step by step:\n\n73 - 65 = 8.\n\n8 * 68 = 544.\n\n544 - 50 = 494. Perfect. That works.

Each number has to be used exactly once, and the result should be 34. The operations allowed are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Hmm, let's start by thinking about possible combinations.\n\nFirst, since the target is 34 and one of the numbers is 34 itself, maybe I can use 34 in a way that cancels out the other numbers or combines with them to get back to 34. For example, if I subtract something from 34 and add something else, maybe it balances out.\n\nLet me list the numbers: 34, 63, 10, 53. Let's see. 63 and 53 are both larger than 34, so maybe subtracting them could help. 10 is smaller. Let's try different arrangements.\n\nWhat if I do 63 - 53? That gives 10. Then I have 34 and 10 left. 10 from the subtraction and the original 10. Wait, but I can't use 10 twice. Oh right, each number must be used once. So maybe that's not the way. Let's try that again. If I do 63 - 53 = 10, then I have 34 and 10 left. But the original 10 hasn't been used yet. So maybe 63 - 53 = 10, and then 34 + 10 - 10? But that would use 10 twice, which isn't allowed. So that's not good.\n\nAlternatively, maybe combine 53 and 10 somehow. 53 minus 10 is 43. Then 63 minus 43 is 20. Not helpful. Hmm.\n\nWhat if I use multiplication or division? Let's think. 63 divided by something? 63 divided by 10 is 6.3, which is a decimal. Maybe not ideal. 53 divided by 10 is 5.3. Hmm. What about 63 minus 34? That's 29. Then 53 minus 29 is 24. Not helpful.\n\nWait, the target is 34. So maybe 34 is part of the equation, like 34 plus something minus something else. Let's see. If I have 34 + (something) - (something else) =34. Then the something and something else need to cancel out. For example, 34 + (63 - 53) -10. Let's compute that: 63-53 is 10, then 34 +10 -10 =34. That works. But wait, does that use all numbers? Let's check. 34 is used, 63, 53, and 10. Yes, all four numbers. So that would be 34 + (63 -53) -10 =34. So the equation is 34 + (63 -53) -10 =34. Let me verify: 63-53 is 10, then 34+10=44, then 44-10=34. Yes, that works. All numbers are used once. The operations are subtraction and addition. So the equation is 34 + (63 - 53) -10 =34. But I need to present it as an equation using all numbers once. Let me check again. The numbers used are 34, 63, 53, and 10. Yes, each once. So that's a valid equation. Alternatively, maybe there's another way, but this seems to work.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe multiplication or division. Let's see. 53 - (63 / something). If I take 63 divided by 10, that's 6.3. Then 53 -6.3 is 46.7, not helpful. 53 - (63/ (something else)). Not sure. Alternatively, 10 multiplied by something. 10 * 34 is 340. That's too big. 10 * (63 -53) is 100, then 340 -100=240, not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 63 - (53 -10) =63 -43=20. Then 34 -20=14. No. Not 34.\n\nAlternatively, 53 -10=43. Then 63 -43=20. Then 34 -20=14. Still not.\n\nWait, maybe I can use division in a way that helps. For example, 63 divided by something equals a number that when subtracted from 53 gives 34. Let's see: 53 - (63 / x) =34. Then 63/x =53-34=19. So x=63/19≈3.315. But 10 is the remaining number. Doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe (53 - x) / y =34. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of 34 as the result of combining the other numbers. Let's see. 63 - (53 + 10) =63-63=0. Then 34 +0=34. But that would use 63,53,10, and 34, but the equation would be 34 + (63 - (53 +10)) =34. Let's compute: 53+10=63, 63-63=0, 34+0=34. So that's 34 + (63 -53 -10) =34. Which simplifies to 34 +0=34. But is that acceptable? The numbers used would be 34,63,53,10 each once. Yes. So another possible equation: 34 + (63 -53 -10) =34. But the problem is that the equation must use all numbers once. Let's check: 34,63,53,10 are all in there. So this works. But does this count? Because 63-53-10 is 0, so effectively 34 +0=34.\n\nSo two possible equations here. One is 34 + (63 -53) -10 =34. Another is 34 + (63 -53 -10)=34. Both seem valid. Maybe the first one is better because it uses each operation once? Not sure. The problem allows using operations multiple times, so either way is okay as long as all numbers are used once.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a different combination. Let's see. 53 - (63 -34) =53-29=24. Then 24 +10=34. So (53 - (63 -34)) +10=34. Let's check: 63-34=29, 53-29=24, 24+10=34. So that uses all numbers: 53,63,34,10. Yes. So that equation is (53 - (63 -34)) +10 =34. Let me verify:\n\n63-34=29\n\n53-29=24\n\n24+10=34.\n\nYes, correct. So this is another valid equation. So that's another way. So this equation uses subtraction, subtraction, and addition. But uses all numbers once. That works too.\n\nSo there are multiple possible equations, but the problem only asks for one. Let me see which one is more straightforward. The first one I thought of was 34 + (63 -53) -10 =34. The second one is (53 - (63 -34)) +10=34. Both are correct. The user might prefer the simplest one. Let me check if the parentheses are necessary. For the first equation: 34 +63 -53 -10. If we just do left to right: 34+63=97, 97-53=44, 44-10=34. So that works without parentheses. Wait, but if written as 34 +63 -53 -10, it's the same as (34 +63) -53 -10. But maybe to make the order explicit, but technically, it can be written without parentheses. But the problem allows using the operations, so perhaps the user expects parentheses to group operations. Let me check the example given: in the example, it's (1 + 2)/3. So parentheses are used. So maybe the answer should group operations with parentheses even if order of operations would allow it otherwise. So for example, if I write 34 +63 -53 -10, according to order of operations, addition and subtraction are left associative, so it would compute as ((34+63)-53)-10. But that's the same as (34+63-53)-10. Which is 44-10=34. So that works. But perhaps the problem expects parentheses to be used to group operations. However, the example shows that even when not necessary (like (1+2)/3), parentheses are used. So perhaps even if the equation can be written without parentheses, they want it with parentheses for clarity. So maybe the first equation should be written with parentheses. But in the first case, it's 34 + (63 -53) -10. The parentheses around 63-53. Alternatively, if written as (34 +63) -53 -10, but that's redundant. So maybe the first way is better.\n\nAlternatively, the equation (53 - (63 -34)) +10. Let's check if that's allowed. The inner parentheses first: 63-34=29, then 53-29=24, then 24+10=34. So that uses all numbers once.\n\nSo which one is better? Either is acceptable. Let me present one of them. The first one seems simpler. So 34 + (63 -53) -10 =34. But in terms of using all operations, but the problem allows using operations multiple times, so that's okay. Alternatively, the second equation uses subtraction twice and addition once. Either way.\n\nSo both equations are valid. I need to choose one. Let's go with the first one because it's shorter: 34 + (63 -53) -10. But wait, that's 34 +10 -10, which is 34. Yes. So that works.\n</think>\n\n<answer>34 + (63 - 53) - 10 = 34</answer>"}]}

Hmm, maybe multiplication would help since 156 is a relatively large number. Let me see possible products.\n\nLooking at 30 and 7, 30*7 is 210. That's higher than 156.

Oh, that's interesting. So if I do 30*7 =210, then subtract (41+13), that would be 210 -54=156. Let me check: 30*7=210, 41+13=54, 210-54=156. But wait, have I used all the numbers?

If I divide by something. 1230 divided by 7.9 is about 156, but I don't have 7.9. Alternatively, 41*3=123, but 3 isn't one of the numbers. Wait, 156 divided by 13 is 12. So maybe 12*13=156. How to get 12 from the other numbers: 41,30,7. Let's see, 30 - (41-7)=30-34= -4, not helpful. Or (41 - (30+7))=41-37=4. Then 4*13=52, not enough. Hmm. Maybe that's not the way.\n\nAlternatively, 30 - 7 =23, 23 * (something). 23*6=138, 23*7=161. Not helpful. Wait 30*13=390. Then 390 divided by something. 390/2.5=156. How to get 2.5 from 41 and 7. 7/(41- something). Not sure. 7/(41-30)=7/11, which is 0.636, not 2.5. Hmm, not helpful.\n\nAnother angle: 41 - 30 =11. 11*13=143. Then 143 +7=150. Close but not 156. Not enough. 41*30=1230. Then 1230 - (13*7)=1230-91=1139. Way too big. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 41 +30=71. 71 +13=84. 84*7=588. No. How about 30 - 13=17. 17*7=119. 119 +41=160. Close, but over by 4. Hmm.\n\nWait, the first idea seems to work. Let me double-check: 30 multiplied by 7 is 210. Then subtract (41+13)=54. 210-54=156. Yes, that's correct. All numbers used once. So the equation is (30 * 7) - (41 + 13) = 156. Let me write it properly with parentheses. The equation would be 30*7 -41 -13 =156, but since addition is commutative, grouping might be needed for clarity. But according to the problem statement, they just need the equation using the numbers once each with operations. So the correct equation is 30*7 -41 -13 =156. Or maybe written as (30*7) - (41+13). Either way, as long as all numbers are used once and operations are correct. Let me verify again: 30*7 is 210. 41+13 is 54. 210-54=156. Correct. Yes, this works.\n</think>\n\n<answer>30*7 - 41 - 13 = 156</answer>"}]}

Let me start by thinking about possible combinations.\n\nFirst, maybe look for pairs that can combine to something useful. For example, 80 minus 73 is 7. Then 44 minus 37 is 7. So if I have two 7s, maybe I can divide them? Wait, but each number can only be used once. So that approach might not work because I can't use 80 and 73 for one 7 and 44 and 37 for another. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, if I do (80 - 73) that's 7, and then (44 - 37) is also 7. Then if I divide those two results, 7 / 7 = 1. But the problem is that each original number must be used once in the equation. So in this case, I'm using all four numbers: 80,73,44,37. The equation would be (80 - 73)/(44 - 37) = 7/7 =1. That uses all numbers once, right? Let me verify:\n\n80 - 73 uses both 80 and 73. Then 44 - 37 uses 44 and 37. So yes, all four numbers are used. And the operations are subtraction and division. So that equation would work. Let me check the arithmetic again: 80-73=7, 44-37=7. Then 7 divided by 7 is indeed 1. So that seems to fit all the requirements. But wait, the problem says \"create an equation that equals 1\" using all numbers. So this seems correct. Let me write that as (80 - 73) / (44 - 37).

So maybe 148 + (7 - 3) = 148 + 4 = 152. That works! Let's check if all numbers are used once. 89, 59, 7, 3—yes. So the equation would be 89 + 59 + (7 - 3) = 152. Wait, but parentheses might be needed to ensure the order of operations. Alternatively, it's 89 + 59 + 7 - 3. Let me verify: 89 + 59 is 148, plus 7 is 155, minus 3 is 152. Yes, that works. So that's 89 + 59 + 7 - 3 = 152. That uses all numbers once. Let me see if there's another way, but this seems straightforward. Let me just check another possibility. What if I multiply some numbers?

How about 57 multiplied by something. 57*8 is 456, but I don't have an 8. Hmm. Alternatively, 57*9=513, which is close to 499. But again, no 9.

So 89 - 54 = 35, then 35 + 80 = 115, 115 - 68 = 47. But I need to structure this as an equation using all numbers once. So maybe ((89 - 54) + 80) - 68.

Wait, 12 divided by something... 12 divided by 4 is 3, but do I have a 4? Hmm, 68 divided by 17 is 4. Oh, that could work. So maybe 88 multiplied by (12 divided by (68 divided by 17))?

Let's see: 88 is used, 12 is used, 68 and 17 are both used in the division. Yes, all four numbers are used once each. So the equation would be 88 * (12 / (68 / 17)) = 264.

If I multiply 74 by something. 74 times 3.5 is 259, which is close. But how do I get 3.5 from the remaining numbers 14, 5, 21. Wait, 14 divided by (5 - something). Or maybe 21 divided by 5 is 4.2, but that's not helpful. Let me think differently.\n\nAlternatively, 21 multiplied by 14 is 294. That's over 266. Then subtract something. 294 minus 74 is 220, which is still not enough. Hmm. What if I do 21 * 14 = 294, then subtract 74 + 5 = 79. That would be 294 - 79 = 215. No, that's not right.\n\nWait, maybe combine 74 and 5 first. 74 minus 5 is 69. Then multiply by something. 69 * 4 is 276. Not quite. Or 74 + 5 = 79. Then 79 times 3 is 237. Still low.\n\nWhat if I use division? Let's see. 21 divided by 14 is 1.5. Then 1.5 times 5 is 7.5. 74 plus 7.5 is 81.5. No. That's way off.\n\nAnother approach: 14 * 5 = 70.

All must be used.\n\nSo target is 14. Let's think about factors of 14. It's 2*7, so maybe I can find a way to get 7 and multiply by 2, or something like that. Alternatively, divide something by a number to get 14. Let me see.\n\nLooking at the numbers: 70 is a big number. 70 divided by 5 is 14. Oh, wait! If I can do 70 / 5, that's 14. But then I still have the two 42s left. How to use them? Wait, but the problem says all numbers must be used. So that approach alone won't work.

So that's a valid equation. \n\nAlternatively, maybe another approach. Let's see. 42 divided by something. 42 divided by 3 is 14, but I don't have a 3. But maybe 5 and another number can make 3. For example, 5 - (70/42). Wait, 70 divided by 42 is approximately 1.666..., so 5 - 1.666 is about 3.333. Then 42 divided by that would be around 12.6. Not 14. Hmm.\n\nAnother idea: 70 minus 42 is 28. Then 28 divided by 2 is 14. But how to get 2? Maybe 5 minus (42 divided by 14). Wait, but that seems circular. Alternatively, maybe use the 5 and 42. 5 multiplied by something. Let me try 42 - (70 / 5). That's 42 - 14 = 28. Then 28 divided by 2 is 14, but again, no 2. Not helpful.\n\nWait, what if we do (70 - (42 + 42)) divided by 5? Let's compute that: 70 - (84) = -14. Then -14 divided by 5 is -2.8. Not 14. That's not good.\n\nAlternatively, (42 * 5) - 70 - 42. 42*5 is 210. 210 -70 is 140. 140 -42 is 98. No.\n\nWait, maybe multiply 5 and 42. 5*42 is 210. Then subtract 70 and 42: 210 -70 = 140, 140 -42=98. Still not.\n\nAlternatively, 42 divided by (5 - (70/42)). Let's compute 70/42 is 1.666..., 5 -1.666 is 3.333. Then 42 divided by 3.333 is 12.6. Not 14.\n\nHmm. Let me go back to the first idea. Since 70 /5 is 14, and then 42-42=0. So adding them gives 14. That seems to work. So the equation is 70/5 + 42 -42 =14. Alternatively, written as (70 /5) + (42 -42) =14. That uses all numbers once. Let me check again: 70,5,42,42. All used once. The operations are division, addition, and subtraction. Yes, that's allowed. So that should be the answer.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(70 / 5) + (42 - 42) = 14</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using the numbers 52, 16, 385, and 87, each exactly once, with basic operations to get 404. Hmm. First, maybe I should look at the target number, 404, and see if it's close to any of these numbers. 385 is a big number, so maybe that's a starting point. If I subtract something from 385, maybe? Let's see: 385 minus something equals 404. Wait, no, 385 is less than 404, so subtracting would make it even smaller. So maybe adding? 385 + something. Let's check 385 + 16 = 401. Close to 404, but 3 more needed. Then maybe 385 + 16 + 52? That's 385+16=401, 401+52=453. Too high. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 385 plus 87. 385+87=472. Then subtract something. 472 - 52=420. Still not 404. 472 - 16=456. Not helpful. What if I subtract 52 and 16 from 385? 385 -52=333, 333-16=317. Not close.\n\nWait, maybe multiplication or division. Let's see. 52*16=832. If I use 832, then how to combine with others. 832 - 385=447. Then subtract 87? 447-87=360. No. 832 + 385=1217, way too big. Maybe divide? 385 divided by something. 385 / 5 =77. But 5 isn't in the numbers. Hmm.\n\nAnother approach: Let's think about 404. It's 400 +4. Maybe 52 * 8 = 416. But 8 isn't here. Wait, 52*7=364. 364 +40=404. 40 is 16 + something. Wait, 16 is a number here. Maybe 52*7 + 16 + something? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, 87 is a big number. Maybe 87*4=348. 348 +56=404. 56 is 16*3.5, but not sure. Let me think.\n\nWait, 385 is a big number. If I subtract 385 from something else? Like, 52*16=832. Then 832 - 385=447. Then maybe 447 - 87=360. No, that's 360. Not helpful. Or 832 - (385 +87)=832-472=360 again. Still not 404.\n\nWhat about combining 385 and 87 first? 385 +87=472. Then subtract 52 and 16. 472 -52=420, 420-16=404. Oh! Wait, that works. Let me check: 385 +87 = 472. Then subtract 52 and 16. So 472 -52 = 420, then 420 -16 =404. But to write this as an equation using all numbers once, we need to combine them with operations. So the equation would be 385 + 87 - 52 -16 = 404. Let's verify: 385+87 is 472. 472-52 is 420. 420-16 is 404. Yes! But does this use all the numbers once and only once? 385,87,52,16. Yes, each used once. So the equation is (385 + 87) - 52 -16 =404. Or maybe written as 385 +87 -52 -16=404. That's correct.\n</think>\n\n<answer>385 + 87 - 52 - 16 = 404</answer>"}]}

I need to make an equation using 60, 10, 92, 64, each exactly once, with basic operations, to get 796. Hmm. Let's start by thinking about the target number. 796 is a pretty large number, so maybe multiplication will be involved. Let me check the possible combinations.\n\nFirst, if I try multiplying the two largest numbers: 92 and 64. 92*64 is 5888, which is way too big. Maybe subtract something from that? But 5888 minus anything here would still be too large. So maybe that's not the right approach.\n\nWait, perhaps combining some of the numbers to get closer. Let's see: 796 is close to 800. If I can get 800 and subtract 4, but I don't have a 4. Alternatively, maybe 64*12.5 is 800, but I don't have 12.5. Hmm.\n\nLet's think of different groupings. For example, 92 multiplied by something. 92*8 is 736. If I could get 8 from the other numbers. Wait, 64 divided by 8 is 8. Wait, but how to get 8 from 60, 10, and 64. Let's see: 64/(10 - (60/ something)). Wait, maybe not. Let's see: 60 divided by 10 is 6. Then 64 - 6 would be 58. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 92*10 is 920. Then maybe 920 plus something. 920 + 64 is 984. Then subtract 60? 984-60=924. Still not 796. Not close enough.\n\nWhat if I use 64*10=640. Then 640 plus 92 is 732. Then 732 plus 60=792. Close, but 792 is 4 less than 796. Hmm. How to get those 4. Maybe 60/10=6, then 64* (something involving 6). Wait, 64*12 is 768. If I have 768, then 768 + 92=860. 860-60=800, which is 4 over. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 92*(10) =920. Then 920 - 64=856. Then 856-60=796. Wait, wait! Let me check that again. 92*10=920. 920 - 64 is 856. Then 856 - 60=796. Wait, that works! Let me check: 92 * 10 =920. Subtract 64 gives 856, then subtract 60 gives 796. Yes! And all numbers are used: 92, 10, 64, 60. Each used once. So the equation is 92*10 -64 -60 =796. But I need to present it as an equation. Let me verify the arithmetic:\n\n92*10=920. 920-64=856. 856-60=796. Yes! So the equation is 92×10 -64 -60 =796. But the problem says to use all numbers once. Wait, but that uses 92,10,64,60. Yes, all four numbers. Each once. The operations are multiplication, subtraction, subtraction. So the equation is (92 * 10) - 64 -60 =796. Let me write that properly with parentheses. Alternatively, maybe group differently: 92*10 - (64 +60) =796. Let me check: 64 +60=124. 920-124=796. Yep. So that's another way to write it. So the equation would be 92×10 - (64 +60) =796. That uses all numbers once and the required operations. Let me check again if that's valid.\n\nYes: 92, 10, 64, 60. Each used once.

Wait, but maybe if I multiply 84 by something else. Let's see, 84 times 7.5 is 630. But I don't have 7.5. Alternatively, 70 times 9 is 630. Do I have a 9? Well, 27 is 3 cubed, so 27 divided by 3 is 9. But I don't have an extra 3. Wait, but maybe I can use 27 and another number to get 9. Let me check.\n\nAlternatively, 28 times 22.5 is 630, but that seems tricky. Let's look at the numbers again: 84, 70, 27, 28. Let's see if multiplying two of them gets close. 84 times 70 is 5880, which is way too big. 84 times 28 is 2352. 70 times 27 is 1890. 70 times 28 is 1960. 27 times 28 is 756. Hmm.

Then 210 plus 27 is 237. Not 630. Hmm. What if I use 84 divided by 28 to get 3, then 70 multiplied by (3 + something). Wait, 70*(something) =630. So 70*9=630. How can I get 9 from 84, 28, and 27? Let's see, 27 is 9*3. If I take 27 and then use 84 and 28 to make 3, then 27 is 9*3. Wait, 84 divided by 28 is 3. So 84/28=3. Then 27 is 9*3. So if I do 27/(84/28) =27/3=9. Then 70*9=630. So putting it all together: 70 * (27 / (84 / 28)) = 630. Let me check that. 84 divided by 28 is 3. Then 27 divided by 3 is 9. 70 multiplied by 9 is 630. Yes! That works.

Let's look at the numbers given: 52, 84, 20, 65. The larger ones are 84 and 65. If I add those together, 84 + 65 = 149. Hmm, that's more than 117. Then maybe subtract something.

If I take 84 and 20, maybe multiply them. 84 * 20 is way too big, 1680. Not useful. What if I divide them? 84 / 20 = 4.2. Maybe not helpful. Hmm.\n\nWait, 65 is a good number. Let me see. 65 multiplied by something. 65 * 2 = 130. If I could get 130 and then subtract 13, but I don't have 13. Alternatively, 65 + 52 = 117. Oh wait! 65 + 52 is exactly 117. But wait, I have to use all four numbers. So that's only two numbers. So I need to incorporate 84 and 20 somehow. So maybe the equation is 65 + 52 + something, but that would exceed. Wait, maybe use 65 + 52 = 117, but then how to include 84 and 20 in a way that cancels them out? Like 65 + 52 + (84 - 84) * 20. But that's using 84 twice, which isn't allowed. Alternatively, maybe use division or subtraction to eliminate them. For example, 65 + 52 + (84 - 20)/something. But that might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, think of 117 as a result of combining operations. Let's see, 84 divided by something. 84 / (20/ something) + ... Hmm, 20 divided by a number. Maybe 84 divided by (20/65) is 84 * 65/20 = (84*65)/20. Let's calculate that: 84 divided by 20 is 4.2, multiplied by 65 is 4.2 *65 = 273. That's way too big. Not helpful.\n\nAnother approach: Let's consider 117 as a target. Let's see, 117 is 130 -13. But how to get 130 and 13 from the numbers. 65 * 2 is 130. 20 - 7=13, but where's 7? Not helpful. Alternatively, 84 + 65 = 149, which is 32 over. So maybe 149 - (52 - 20). 52 -20 is 32. 149 -32 = 117. Oh! Wait, that's possible. Let's check: 84 +65 =149. Then subtract (52 -20) which is 32. So 149 -32 =117. So the equation would be (84 +65) - (52 -20) =117. Let's verify: 84 +65=149; 52-20=32; 149-32=117. Yes! And all numbers are used once. Let me check if that's correct. The numbers used are 84, 65, 52, 20. Each exactly once. Operations used are addition, subtraction, and subtraction. So the equation is (84 + 65) - (52 - 20) = 117.

Let's list the numbers again: 51, 16, 1, 66. 66 is a big number, so maybe that can be part of it. If I add 66 and 51, that's 117.

Hmm, but how can I get 2 from the remaining numbers 51,16,1. Wait, 51 divided by something? 16-14=2, but not sure. Maybe 16 divided by something. Wait, 16/(51- something).

Then 67 times 2 is 134, which is close. But how to adjust. 67*2 -1=133. Oh, wait! 67*2 is 134, minus 1 is 133. So that would require (51 +16)*2 -1 =133. But wait, but where do the numbers 2 come from? Because I have to use all numbers: 51,16,1,66. The 66 isn't used here. So this approach isn't valid because I can't just create a 2; I have to use the given numbers.\n\nWait, maybe use 66 and 51. Let's see, 66 +51=117. Then 117 +16=133, but then 1 is left. But how to include the 1. Alternatively, maybe 66*2 +1=133. But again, how to get the 2 from 16 and 51. Maybe 16 divided by 8, but 8 isn't available.

But maybe I can use the 1 in a division or multiplication. Like 82 + (51/1) =82+51=133. But that uses 51,66,16, and 1. Wait, let's check: 66 +16=82, then 51 divided by 1 is 51. Then 82 +51=133. So the equation would be (66 +16) + (51/1) =133. But does that use all numbers? Yes: 66,16,51,1. So that works. Let me check: 66+16=82, 51/1=51, 82+51=133. Yes! That adds up to 133. So the equation would be (66 + 16) + (51 / 1) =133. But let me verify all numbers are used: 66,16,51,1. All are there. And all operations are basic arithmetic.

Let's check if 469 is divisible by any of the numbers provided.\n\n469 divided by 7: 469 ÷ 7 is 67. So 7 * 67 = 469. But 67 isn't one of the numbers, but maybe 67 can be made from the remaining numbers 55, 23, and 11. Let's see. 55 + 23 is 78, which is too big. 55 - 23 is 32. 55 - 11 is 44. Hmm, not 67. Maybe 23 + 11 = 34. Still not. How about 55 + 23 - 11? That's 55+23=78, minus 11 is 67. Oh! So 7 * (55 +23 -11) would be 7*67=469. Let me check that.\n\nWait, 55 +23 is 78. 78 -11 is 67. Then 7 multiplied by 67 is indeed 469. But wait, the numbers used here are 7, 55, 23, and 11. Yes, all four numbers are used once each. So the equation would be 7 * (55 +23 -11) = 469. Let me compute each part to confirm:\n\n55 +23 =78. 78-11=67. 67*7=469. Yes, that works. So maybe that's the solution. But let me see if there are other ways, just to be sure. Alternatively, maybe using division or subtraction in another way. Let me try.\n\nAnother approach: 55 is a big number. If I multiply 55 by something. Let's see. 55 * 8 is 440, which is close to 469. How to get 8 from 23,7,11. Hmm. 23 -7 -11 is 5. Not 8. Or 23 - (7 +11) =5. Maybe 7 + (11 - (23))? That would be negative. Not helpful. Alternatively, 23/(something). 23 divided by (11-7) is 23/4=5.75. Then 55*5.75=316.25. Not helpful. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, 55*7=385. Then 385 + something. 469-385=84. Need to get 84 from 23 and 11. 23*3 +11* something? Wait, 23+11=34. 84-34=50. Not helpful. Or 23*4=92, which is over. Maybe 23* (11 - (something)). Like 23*(11 - (7))? 11-7=4. 23*4=92. 55*7=385. 385+92=477, which is 8 over. Close but not 469. Alternatively, 23*(11 -7)=92. 385+92=477. No. Or maybe subtract instead. 55*7=385. Then 469-385=84. So 84 needs to come from 23 and11. 23*3 +11* something. Wait, 23*3=69, 84-69=15, which would need 15 from 11 and... but I already used 23 once. Wait, but each number can be used once. So maybe 23* (11 - (something)). Let's see. 11 - (something) multiplied by 23. Maybe (11 -7) =4. 23*4=92. Then 385 +92=477. Not 469. Hmm.\n\nAnother idea: 23*11=253. 55*7=385. 253+385=638. That's way over. Alternatively, subtract: 55*7 -23*11=385-253=132. Not 469. Hmm.\n\nWhat if we divide? Maybe 55 divided by something. 55/11=5. Then 5 +23=28. 28*7=196. Not enough. Or 23*7=161. 161 +5=166. Not helpful. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, 55 -23=32. 32*7=224. 224 +11=235. No. 55 - (23 +7)=25. 25*11=275. No.\n\nWait, the first idea seems to work. Let me check again. 55 +23=78. 78-11=67. Then 7*67=469. All numbers used once. So the equation is 7*(55 +23 -11) =469. Let me write that as 7*(55+23-11)=469. That should be the correct answer. Let me confirm once more:\n\n55+23=78. 78-11=67. 67*7=469. Yes, exactly. So that's the solution. I think that's the right approach. Other methods didn't work out, so this must be the correct equation.\n</think>\n\n<answer>7 * (55 + 23 - 11) = 469</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using the numbers 40, 1, 28, and 9 exactly once each, with basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) to get 292. Hmm. Alright, let's start by thinking about the target number, 292. It's a bit over 280, so maybe 28 times something. Let's check 28*10 is 280, which is close. But how do I get from there to 292? That's 12 more. Wait, 28*10 + 12 = 292. But I need to use 40,1,28,9. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 40 is involved. Let's see, 40*7 is 280, again close to 292. But where would the 7 come from? The other numbers are 1, 28, 9. Hmm. 28 minus 1 is 27, which divided by 9 is 3. Not helpful. Alternatively, 9 - 1 is 8. 40*8 is 320, which is way over.\n\nWait, perhaps combining multiplication and addition. For example, 40* something plus or minus another number. Let's see. Let's try 40*7=280, then plus 12 gives 292. So how to get 7 and 12 from the remaining numbers 1,28,9. Wait, 28 divided by (9-1) is 28/8=3.5. Not 7. Alternatively, 9+1=10. 40*10=400. 400 - 28=372. That's too much. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 28*9 is 252. Then 252 +40=292. Wait, 252+40=292? Let me check: 252+40=292? 252+40=292. Yes! 252 +40=292. So that uses 28*9 +40. But then we have to use the 1. Wait, but we have to use all four numbers. So in this case, 28*9 +40 uses 28,9,40, but the 1 is left. So that's not allowed. So I need to include the 1 somehow.\n\nMaybe I can adjust that. For example, 28*(9 + something) + something else. Let's see. If I do 28*(9 +1) that would be 28*10=280. Then 280 + something to get to 292. 292-280=12. So 280 +12=292. Where can I get 12 from? The remaining numbers would be 40. But 40 isn't 12. Wait, but maybe 40 is being used here. Wait, but if I used 28,9,1 in 28*(9+1)=280, then 280 + 40/ something. Wait, but 40 hasn't been used yet. So maybe 280 + (40 / something). But 40 divided by what? The numbers left would be 40 and nothing else. Wait, perhaps another approach.\n\nWait, 40*(something) + or - another term. Let's try 40*7=280. Then 280 +12=292. How to get 7 and 12 from 1,28,9. Maybe 28 divided by (9-1) is 28/8=3.5. Not helpful. Alternatively, 9-1=8, 40*8=320. 320 -28=292. Wait, that's 40*(9-1) -28= 40*8=320-28=292. Let's check: 40*(9-1) is 40*8=320, 320-28=292. So that uses all numbers: 40, 1 (in 9-1), 28, and 9. Wait, let's verify each number is used once: 40 is used, 1 is used in (9-1), 28 is subtracted, 9 is used in (9-1). So yes, all four numbers are used once. So the equation would be 40*(9-1) -28 = 292. Let me check the arithmetic: 9-1=8, 40*8=320, 320-28=292. Yes! That works. So the equation is 40*(9 - 1) - 28 = 292. Let me make sure all numbers are used: 40, 9, 1, 28. Yes, all used once. Great, that works.\n</think>\n\n<answer>40*(9 - 1) - 28 = 292</answer>"}]}

Hmm, let's see. \n\nFirst, let me note that 258 is the target. Let's think about possible combinations. Maybe starting with the largest number, 637. If I subtract something from 637 to get close to 258, what's 637 minus 258? That's 379. So maybe I need to make 379 using 43, 42, and 91. But 43, 42, and 91—how can those combine to 379? Let's see. 43 + 42 = 85, plus 91 is 176. That's way too low. Multiply 43 and 42: 43*42 is 1806, which is way too high. Hmm. Maybe division? 91 divided by something... Not sure. Maybe 43*91 is 3913, which is way over. So maybe that approach isn't the right one.\n\nAlternatively, maybe adding some numbers first. Let's see. 637 minus something equals 258. So the something would need to be 637 - 258 = 379. But as before, using 43, 42, 91 to get 379 seems difficult. So maybe subtraction isn't the right approach here.\n\nWhat if we try multiplying some numbers? Let's see. Let's take 43 and 42. 43*42 is 1806. If I divide that by something to get close to 258. 1806 divided by 7 is 258, but 7 isn't one of our numbers. Wait, do we have a 7? The numbers are 637, 43, 42, 91. 42 is 6*7, but we can't use 7 alone. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe 1806 divided by (91 - something). Let's see. 91 minus 637, no, that would be negative. Maybe 91 minus 43? 91-43=48. Then 1806 /48 is about 37.6, which is not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, maybe 43*6=258. Wait, 43*6 is 258. Oh! That's interesting. So 43 multiplied by 6 equals 258. But how do we get 6 from the remaining numbers? The remaining numbers would be 637, 42, and 91. So can we make 6 using 637, 42, and 91? Let's see. 42 divided by (637 - 91). Let's compute 637 -91=546. Then 42 divided by 546 is 42/546=0.0769... which is 1/13. Not 6. Alternatively, 637 divided by 91 is 7. Then 7 - (42/something). Wait, 637/91=7. Then 7 minus something to get 6. So 7 -1=6. But how to get 1 from 42. 42 divided by 42=1. But we already used 42 in the denominator. Wait, but can we use 42 again? No, each number can only be used once. So we have 637, 91, and 42 left. Let me see: 637 divided by 91 is 7. Then 42 divided by 7 is 6. Wait, that's 42/(637/91) = 42/(7) =6. So that gives us 6. Then 43*6=258. Let me check this step by step.\n\nSo first, take 637 and divide by 91: 637/91=7. Then take 42 divided by that result: 42/7=6. Then multiply by 43: 43*6=258. So the equation would be 43*(42/(637/91)) =258. Let's verify that. Compute 637 divided by 91: 637 ÷91=7. Then 42 ÷7=6. Then 43×6=258. Yes, that works! All numbers used once: 637,91,42,43. Perfect. So the equation is 43*(42/(637/91))=258. Let me write that with parentheses properly: (43 * (42 / (637 / 91))). Let's check the order of operations. First, the innermost division: 637/91=7. Then 42 divided by 7=6. Then 43 multiplied by 6=258. Yep, that works. So this should be the correct equation.\n</think>\n\n<answer>43 * (42 / (637 / 91)) = 258</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using all the numbers 89, 64, 96, and 10 exactly once, and the result should be 240. The operations allowed are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Hmm. Let me start by thinking about how these numbers can combine to reach 240. \n\nFirst, 240 is a multiple of 10, so maybe using 10 in a multiplication or division could help. Let me check the numbers: 89 is a prime number, which might be tricky. 64 is 2^6, 96 is 16*6 or 8*12, and 10 is 2*5. Maybe combining 96 and 64 first? Let's see.\n\nIf I subtract 64 from 96, that gives me 32. Then 32 times something? If I have 32 * 10, that's 320. But 320 is too big. What if I subtract 89 from that? 320 - 89 is 231, which isn't 240. Not quite.\n\nAlternatively, adding 96 and 64 gives 160. Then 160 multiplied by something. Let's see, 160 * 1.5 is 240. But how to get 1.5? Maybe using 10 and 89. If I take 89 divided by 10, that's 8.9. Hmm, not helpful. Alternatively, 89 minus 10 is 79, which also doesn't seem useful here.\n\nWait, maybe I can use division with 96 and 64. 96 divided by 64 is 1.5. Then 1.5 multiplied by 10 gives 15. Then adding 225 (which is 89 + 136? Not sure). Maybe this isn't the right path.\n\nLet's think differently. Maybe combine 89 and 64. 89 + 64 = 153. Then 153 + 96 = 249. Then subtract 9? But 10 isn't 9. Not helpful. Alternatively, 153 - 96 = 57. Then 57 * something? 57*4 is 228, which is close. But how to get 4 from 10? 10/2.5, but not helpful.\n\nWait, 89 - 64 = 25. Then 25 * 10 = 250. Then 250 - 96 = 154. No, that's not 240. \n\nHow about multiplication: 64 * 10 = 640. Then 640 divided by something? If I divide by 96, that's 640/96 ≈6.666. Then add 89? 6.666 +89 ≈95.666. Not close.\n\nAlternatively, 89 * 10 = 890. Subtract 64*96? Wait, 64*96 is 6144. 890 - 6144 is way negative. Not good.\n\nHmm. Maybe using division. Let's see, 96 divided by 10 is 9.6. Then multiply by 89. 9.6*89. Let's calculate that: 9*89=801, 0.6*89=53.4, total 854.4. Then subtract 64? 854.4-64=790.4. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 89 divided by 10 is 8.9. Then multiply by 64. 8.9*64. Let's see: 8*64=512, 0.9*64=57.6, total 569.6. Subtract 96? 569.6 -96=473.6. Not 240.\n\nWhat if I try to make 240 by combining operations. For example, 240 can be written as (something + something) multiplied or divided. Let's think about 240 = 24 * 10. So if I can get 24 using 89, 64, 96. But 24 from those numbers? Maybe 96 divided by 4, but 4 isn't directly available. 89 minus 65 is 24, but I have 64, not 65. Close. 89 - (64 + 1) = 24, but again, where's the 1? Hmm.\n\nWait, 64 divided by something. 64 divided by (89 - 96/10). Let's see: 96/10 is 9.6, 89 -9.6=79.4. Then 64/79.4≈0.806. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 96 - 64 = 32. Then 32 * (89 -10). 89-10=79. 32*79=2528. Way too big. Nope.\n\nMaybe 89 + (64 + 96)/10. Let's check: 64+96=160. 160/10=16. 89+16=105. Not 240.\n\nAlternatively, (89 - 64) * (96 / 10). 89-64=25. 96/10=9.6. 25*9.6=240. Oh! Wait, that works! Let me check again:\n\n89 minus 64 is 25. 96 divided by 10 is 9.6. Then 25 multiplied by 9.6 equals exactly 240. Yes! So the equation is (89 - 64) * (96 / 10) = 240. All numbers used once. Perfect.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(89 - 64) * (96 / 10) = 240</answer>"}]}

Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I'll list out the numbers: 25, 93, 10, 45. All must be used, so the equation will have all four numbers connected through operations. Since 112 is a bit over 100, maybe combining the larger numbers first could help. The largest numbers here are 93 and 45. Let me see what operations between them might get close to 112.\n\nIf I subtract 45 from 93, that's 93 - 45 = 48. Hmm, 48 is still lower than 112. What if I add them? 93 + 45 = 138. That's over 112. Maybe I can use the other numbers to adjust 138 down to 112. The remaining numbers are 25 and 10. So 138 minus something... Let's see, 138 - 25 = 113, which is close. Then subtract 1 more? But I have 10 left. Wait, maybe 138 - (25 + 10) = 138 - 35 = 103. Not quite. Alternatively, 138 - (25 - 10) = 138 - 15 = 123. Still not 112.\n\nAlternatively, maybe multiply some numbers. Let's see. 93 - 45 is 48. Then if I use 25 and 10, maybe 25 - 10 = 15. Then 48 + 15 = 63. Not helpful. Or 25 * 10 = 250. 250 + 48 = 298, way too big. Hmm.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe start with 45 and 10. 45 - 10 = 35. Then 35 * something? 35 * 3 = 105, but where do I get 3 from? Maybe 93 divided by something. 93 divided by 25 is about 3.72, which isn't helpful. Alternatively, 93 - 25 = 68. Then 68 + 35 = 103. Still not 112.\n\nWait, 45 + 25 = 70. Then 70 + 93 = 163. Then 163 - 10 = 153. No. That's too high.\n\nWhat if I do 93 - (45 / 10) = 93 - 4.5 = 88.5. Then add 25? 88.5 +25=113.5. Close to 112, but not exact. And we can't use fractions here unless allowed, but the problem might not require integers. But 113.5 isn't 112. So maybe that's not the way.\n\nAlternatively, 93 - (25 + 45) = 93 -70=23. Then 23 *10=230. Not close.\n\nWait, perhaps division can help. Let's think. If I have 93 and 45, maybe 93 divided by something. 93 / 45 is approximately 2.066. Not helpful. Or 45 / 10 = 4.5. Then 25 *4.5=112.5. Oh! That's very close to 112. But 112.5 is 112.5, which is 0.5 over. Wait, but can I adjust that? Let's see: 45 divided by 10 is 4.5. Then 25 *4.5 = 112.5. But I still have the 93 left. Hmm, but I have to use all numbers. So maybe 25 * (45 / 10) + something involving 93. But that would require using 93 in a way that subtracts 0.5, but since we can only use each number once, perhaps there's another way.\n\nAlternatively, if I do (93 - 45) * (10 / 25). Let's calculate that: 93-45=48, 10/25=0.4, then 48*0.4=19.2. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe combining 25 and 10 in a way that gives a larger number. 25 *10=250. Then 250 - 93=157. 157 -45=112. Wait, 250 -93=157, 157 -45=112. That uses all numbers: 25*10 -93 -45 = 112. Let me check that:\n\n25 * 10 = 250\n\n250 - 93 = 157\n\n157 - 45 = 112\n\nYes! That works. So the equation would be 25 * 10 - 93 -45 = 112.\n\nLet me verify each step:\n\nMultiply 25 and 10: 25*10=250.\n\nSubtract 93: 250-93=157.\n\nSubtract 45: 157-45=112.\n\nYes, that's correct. All numbers are used once: 25, 10, 93, 45. The operations used are multiplication, subtraction, and subtraction again. So this should be the answer.\n</think>\n\n<answer>25 * 10 - 93 - 45 = 112</answer>"}]}

It's a bit over 250, so maybe I need to multiply some of the larger numbers together and then add or subtract the others. Let me jot down the numbers: 98 is the largest, then 81, 78, and 38. \n\nFirst idea: Maybe multiply 98 by 3 to get close? Wait, 98*3 is 294, which is just one less than 295. But how can I get that 1 from the remaining numbers? Let me check. The remaining numbers would be 81, 78, and 38. Wait, but I have to use all of them. So maybe that approach isn't right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe multiply two numbers and add or subtract the others. Let's see. Let's try 98 and 81. 98 + 81 is 179. Then 78 and 38. Maybe 78 - 38 = 40. Then 179 + 40 = 219. Not enough. What if I multiply instead? Let's try 98 * 3 = 294 again, but I can't use 3 here. Wait, I don't have a 3. The available numbers are fixed. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps 81 * 3 is 243. But again, 3 isn't available. Wait, maybe combine 78 and 38. Let's see. 78 - 38 is 40. Then 40 * 98 would be 3920, way too big. Alternatively, 78 + 38 = 116. 116 * 2.5 is 290, but again, not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, think about division. Maybe if I can get a larger number by dividing. Wait, 81 divided by something? 81/38 is about 2.13. Hmm. Maybe 98 + (81/38) +78? Let's calculate: 98 + (81/38) ≈ 98 + 2.13 ≈ 100.13, then +78 is 178.13. Not close.\n\nWait another angle: Let's try to reach 295 by combining two numbers and then the other two. For example, (98 + 78) = 176, then 176 + (81 + 38) = 176 + 119 = 295. Wait, 81 +38 is 119? 81+38=119? Let me check: 80+30=110, 1+8=9, so yes, 119. Then 176+119=295. Oh, that works! Wait, but are we allowed to just add all of them in that way? Let me check: 98 +78 +81 +38. Wait, that's 98+78=176, 81+38=119. 176+119=295. But that's just adding all the numbers. So 98 +78 +81 +38 = 295. Let me add them step by step: 98 +78 is 176. 81 +38 is 119. 176+119=295. Yes, that's correct. But wait, the problem says \"create an equation that equals 295\" using each number once with basic operations. So if addition is allowed, then this works. But wait, the example given in the problem uses parentheses, like (1 + 2)/3. But maybe in this case, just adding all the numbers is allowed. Wait, let me check the numbers again: 98 + 38 +78 +81. Let me sum them up: 98+38=136, 136+78=214, 214+81=295. Yes! So the equation would be 98 + 38 +78 +81 = 295. But the problem says \"using basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) one or multiple times\". So addition is allowed. But wait, the user might expect that it's required to use multiple operations, but the problem statement says \"one or multiple times\". So if all the numbers are added together, that's a valid equation. Wait, but let me check the sum again to be sure. 98 +38 is 136, plus 78 is 214, plus 81 is indeed 295. So the equation is simply 98 + 38 + 78 + 81 = 295. But maybe the user intended for some operations beyond just addition? Let me check the problem statement again. It says \"create an equation that equals 295. You can use basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) one or multiple times but each number can only be used once, and you must use all the numbers.\" So adding all numbers is allowed since addition is a basic operation, and you use each number once. Therefore, the equation would be correct. But let me check if this is the case. Because sometimes these puzzles expect you to combine operations, but according to the problem statement, it's acceptable. So the answer would be 98 + 38 + 78 + 81 = 295. However, let me check if there's another way in case that the user expects a combination of operations. But perhaps this is the correct answer. Let me confirm once again. 98 +38 is 136. 136 +78 is 214. 214 +81 is 295. Yes, correct. So the equation is just the sum of all four numbers. Therefore, the answer is 98 + 38 +78 +81 = 295.\n</think>\n\n<answer>98 + 38 + 78 + 81 = 295</answer>"}]}

Hmm.\n\nFirst, maybe think about how to get smaller numbers from these. Since 14 is half of 28, and I have two 29s. Wait, subtract them? 29 - 29 is 0, which might not help. Or maybe 56 divided by 4 is 14. Oh, wait! 56 divided by 4 is 14. But then I still have two 29s left, which I need to use. Hmm.\n\nSo if I use 56 / 4 to get 14, then I have 29 and 29 left. But how to incorporate them. Maybe combine them in a way that cancels out. Like 29 - 29 = 0, and then add that to 56/4. But that would be 14 + 0 = 14, but does that count? The problem says I have to use all numbers. So even if one part is zero, as long as all are used. Let me check the rules again. It says each number can only be used once, and must use all. So 56/4 + (29-29) = 14 + 0. But that uses all numbers. Let me see: 56, 4, 29, 29. All used once. So that works. But wait, the two 29s are used once each. So that should be allowed. So the equation would be (56 / 4) + (29 - 29) = 14. Let me check: 56 divided by 4 is 14. 29 minus 29 is 0. 14 + 0 is 14. Yep, that works. So maybe that's the solution. But let me see if there's another way, just in case. Maybe combining them differently. Like 56 - (29 + 29) / 4. Let's compute that: 29 +29 is 58. 58 divided by 4 is 14.5. 56 -14.5 is 41.5. Not 14. Or maybe (56 - (29 + 29)) *4. 56 -58 is -2. -2 *4 is -8. No. Alternatively, 56/(29 - (29/4)). Let's see: 29/4 is 7.25. 29 -7.25 is 21.75. 56 divided by that is about 2.57. Not 14. Hmm. Another approach: 29 - (56/4) +29. Let's calculate: 56/4 is 14. 29 -14 is 15. 15 +29 is 44. No. Or maybe (29 +29) - (56/4). 58 -14 =44. Still not. What if multiply: 29 * (56/(29+4)). Let's see: 29+4=33. 56/33 is around 1.697. 29*1.697≈49.2. Not 14. Maybe subtract and divide. How about (56 - (29 -29)) /4. That would be 56 -0=56. 56/4=14. Oh! That's another way. So (56 - (29 -29)) /4 =14. Let's check: 29-29 is 0. 56 -0 is 56. 56 divided by4 is14. Yes, but that uses all numbers: 56, 29,29,4. Each once. So that's another valid equation. So either this one or the previous one. But the problem says to return one equation. So both would be correct. But maybe the first one is simpler. The user might prefer one over the other. Let me check which one is more straightforward. The first solution is (56 /4) + (29-29) =14. The second is (56 - (29-29))/4 =14. Both use all numbers. Either should be correct. Let me pick one. Maybe the second one since it groups all numbers into one expression without adding zero. But either is acceptable. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects a certain order. Let me make sure that in the second equation, all numbers are used once. Yes: 56, 29,29,4. Each once. So both equations are valid. So either is correct. So I can choose one. Let me present the second one as the answer: (56 - (29 - 29)) /4 =14. Or written without the equals sign as the equation. The problem says \"create an equation that equals 14\", so the left-hand side should evaluate to 14. So (56 - (29 - 29)) /4 is 14. So that's a valid answer. Alternatively, (56 /4) + (29 -29) is also 14. Either way. Let me check if the problem allows using parentheses. The example given uses parentheses, so yes. So both are acceptable. I'll go with the second one because it's a single division after combining the 29s. So the answer would be <answer>(56 - (29 - 29)) / 4</answer>\n</think>\n\n<answer>(56 - (29 - 29)) / 4</answer>"}]}

Hmm.\n\nFirst, let's think about the target number, 61. It's a prime number, so maybe subtraction or division could help. Let's see how the given numbers might combine to get there.\n\nLooking at the numbers: 86 is the largest. If I subtract something from 86, maybe. Let's try 86 - 25 = 61, but how do I get 25 from the remaining numbers 18, 14, 7? 18 + 7 is 25. But then 86 - (18 + 7) = 61. That uses 86, 18, 7, leaving out 14. But I need to use all numbers. So that doesn't work.\n\nWait, maybe use division or multiplication. Let's try another approach. Let's see if 14 and 7 can be combined. 14 divided by 7 is 2. Then maybe 18 * 2 = 36. But 86 - 36 is 50, which is not 61. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 18 + 14 is 32. 32 plus something. 32 + 29 = 61. How to get 29 from 86 and 7? 86 divided by something. 86 divided by 7 is around 12.28. Not helpful. 86 minus (7 * something). 7*8=56, 86-56=30. 32 +30=62, close but no.\n\nWait, maybe 86 - (18 + 14) = 86 -32=54. Then 54 +7=61. Oh! Wait, that would be 86 -18 -14 +7 = 61. Let me check: 86-18 is 68, 68-14 is 54, 54+7 is 61. Yes! But does that use all numbers once? 86, 18, 14, 7. Yes, all used. And the operations are subtraction and addition. So the equation would be 86 - 18 -14 +7 =61. But let me verify the order of operations. Since subtraction and addition are left associative, so 86-18 is 68, minus 14 is 54, plus 7 is 61. Correct. So that works.\n\nWait, but the problem says to create an equation. So maybe write it as (86 - 18 -14) +7 =61, but parentheses aren't necessary here. Alternatively, 86 -18 -14 +7 =61. But the example given in the problem uses parentheses, like (1+2)/3. So maybe I can present it as is, but perhaps they want some combination with multiplication or division. Although in this case, the solution uses only subtraction and addition. Let me check again if that's acceptable. The problem allows basic operations, so yes, + and - are allowed. So the equation 86 -18 -14 +7 =61 uses all numbers once and equals 61. Let me check if that's correct.\n\n86 -18 is 68. 68-14 is 54. 54+7 is 61. Yes. So that's correct. Therefore, the equation is 86 - 18 -14 +7 =61. But let me check if there's another way using multiplication or division. For example, maybe 18 divided by something. Let's see: 86 - (14 +7) = 86 -21=65. 65 - (18/ something?) Hmm. 65 -4=61, so 18/4.5=4. But 4.5 isn't an available number. Alternatively, 86 - (14 * something). 14 * 4 =56, 86-56=30. Then 30 +18 +7=55, not 61. Not helpful.\n\nAnother approach: 7 * something. 7*9=63, which is close. 18-14=4. 86 -4=82. Not helpful. Hmm. What if I do 86 - (18 - (14/7))? Let's calculate: 14/7=2, 18-2=16, 86-16=70. Not 61. \n\nAlternatively, (86 - (18 * something)) + ... Let's see. 18*3=54, 86-54=32. Then 32 +14 +7=53. No. Not helpful. \n\nAnother idea: 86 divided by something. 86/14 is approximately 6.14. Then 6.14 * 7=42.98. Not helpful. 86/7 is about 12.28. 12.28 + something. Maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, 18 +14=32. 86-7=79. 79-32=47. Not 61. \n\nHmm. Maybe multiplication and division. Let's see: 14 *7=98. 98 -86=12. 18-12=6. Not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, 86 - (14 * (7 - (18 ... )) ). Wait, this is getting too complicated. Let's stick to the first solution I found: 86 -18 -14 +7 =61. That uses all numbers once with the operations allowed. Let me confirm that this is acceptable. The problem states that each number can be used once, and all must be used, which this does.

I need to create an equation using the numbers 64, 97, 65, and 11, each exactly once, and the result should be 237. The operations allowed are +, -, *, /. Hmm, how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should think about the target number, 237. Let me consider possible combinations of these numbers. 237 is a bit over 200, so maybe a combination of multiplication and addition. Let me look at the numbers: 97 is the largest, followed by 65, 64, and 11. \n\nIf I try to multiply some of the larger numbers, maybe. Let's see: 97 multiplied by something. 97*2 is 194, which is less than 237. If I multiply 97 by 3, that's 291, which is higher than 237. So maybe 97 plus another number? 97 + 64 is 161, which is still low. 97 + 65 is 162. Adding 64 and 65 gives 129, but we need to use all numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe subtract some numbers. Let's see. If I take 97 and subtract 11, that's 86. Then multiply by something. 86 times 3 is 258, which is still over. Hmm. Or 97 * 2.5 is around 242.5. Not sure. Wait, 64 is a multiple of 16. Let me see.\n\nWait, another approach: 237 divided by 97 is approximately 2.44, which isn't helpful. Let's think about how to reach 237 using combinations. Maybe 65 * 3.65? Not helpful. Maybe 64 * 3.7? Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe combining 64 and 65. 64 + 65 is 129. Then 129 * something. 129 * 2 is 258. If I subtract 11 from that, 258 - 11 = 247. Close, but not 237. Hmm. 129 * 1.8? Not sure. Alternatively, 64 * 3 is 192. 192 + 65 is 257. Then subtract 20 (but I don't have 20). Wait, but we have 11 and 97. Maybe 97 - 11 = 86. Then 192 + 86 is 278. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 97 * 2 is 194. 194 + 64 is 258. Then 258 - 21 is 237. How to get 21 from 65 and 11? 65 - 11 is 54. That doesn't help. Wait, maybe 65 / something. 65 divided by 11 is about 5.9. Hmm. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe 97 + (64 * 2) = 97 + 128 = 225. Then add 12 to get 237. But 12 can come from 65 and 11? 65 - 11 = 54. Not 12. Alternatively, 65 - 11 = 54, but then 225 +54=279. No. Hmm.\n\nWhat if I do 65 * 3. Let's see. 65 * 3 is 195. Then add 42. 195 +42=237. 42 can be 64 - 22, but we don't have 22. Alternatively, 64 - (97- something). Not sure.\n\nAnother angle: maybe use division to reduce a number. For example, 97 * (65 / something) + or - the rest. Let's see. 65 divided by 11 is about 5.9. 97 * 5.9 is about 572, which is way over. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, subtract two numbers and multiply. Like (97 - 64) = 33. Then 33 * 7 is 231. Then add 6. But 7 and 6 from where? Not sure. Or 33 * 6 = 198. 198 + 39 = 237. But where do 39 come from?\n\nWait, let's think of 237 as 97 + 65 + 64 + 11. Let's add them: 97+65=162, 162+64=226, 226+11=237. Wait, that's just 97+65+64+11=237. Wait, but that uses all numbers with addition. But that can't be right. Let me check: 97+65=162, 162+64=226, 226+11=237. Yes! Oh! So the equation is simply 97 + 65 + 64 + 11. But wait, that uses all numbers once and adds up exactly to 237. But why didn't I think of that earlier? Maybe because I thought it was too straightforward, but perhaps that's the answer.\n\nWait, let me verify again: 97+65 is 162, 162+64 is 226, plus 11 is 237. Yes. So that works. So the equation is 97 + 65 + 64 + 11 = 237. But the problem says \"create an equation that equals 237\" and allows using arithmetic operations. So if adding all of them together works, that's acceptable. But I need to check if the problem allows that. The problem says \"using the numbers 64, 97, 65, 11, create an equation that equals 237. You can use basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) one or multiple times but each number can only be used once, and you must use all the numbers.\"\n\nYes, so addition is allowed. Therefore, the equation is simply the sum of all four numbers. So that's the solution. But I wonder why I didn't think of that first. Maybe because I assumed it might require more complex operations. But sometimes the simplest solution works. Let me confirm once more:\n\n97 + 65 = 162\n\n162 + 64 = 226\n\n226 + 11 = 237.\n\nYes, correct.

I need to create an equation using the numbers 8, 16, 19, and 98, each exactly once, with basic arithmetic operations, and the result should be 931. Hmm, 931 is a pretty big number, so I probably need to use multiplication here to get it that high. Let me think about how to combine these numbers.\n\nFirst, let's look at the largest number given: 98. If I can multiply that by something to get close to 931, that might work. 98 times 9 is 882, which is still lower than 931. 98 times 10 would be 980, which is 49 over. Wait, maybe combining 98 with another number in a way that adds or subtracts something.\n\nLet me check 931 divided by 98. Let's do 98 × 9.5 = 931. Because 98 × 9 is 882, 98 × 0.5 is 49, so 882 + 49 is 931. So 9.5. So if I can get 9.5 by combining the other numbers (8, 16, 19), that might work. But 8, 16, 19. How can those make 9.5?\n\nAlternatively, maybe 98 × 9 + something. Let's see: 98×9=882, then 931-882=49. So if I can get 49 from the remaining numbers. The remaining numbers would be 8,16,19. Let's see: 19 + 16 + 8=43. Not enough. 19 × 2.5=47.5. Hmm. Not sure. Alternatively, maybe 16 × 3 + 8=56. 56 is 7×8. Not 49. How about 16 × (19 - 8) = 16×11=176. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe not multiplying 98 first. Let's see other combinations. Let's think of 931. What's 931 minus 98? That's 833. Then need to make 833 with 8,16,19. Hmm. That seems tough. 19 × 43 is 817. But 43 is not easy to get. Alternatively, 16 × 52 is 832, so 16×52 +1=833, but I don't have 52. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe subtract some numbers. Let's think 19 is a prime number. 8 and 16 are powers of 2. Maybe 16 divided by 8 is 2. Then 2 × something. Let's see: 19 + 98=117. 117 × (16/8)=117×2=234. Not close. Alternatively, 98 - 19=79. Then 79 × (16 -8)=79×8=632. Still not 931.\n\nWait, maybe I need to combine multiplication and addition. For example, 98 × (16 - 8) + 19. Let's calculate that: 98 ×8 +19= 784 +19=803. Not enough. 98× (16 - something) + something. 98× (16 - (19-8))? Let's see: 19-8=11, so 16-11=5. 98×5=490. 490 plus what? Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 16 × 19 is 304. 304 × something. 304×3=912. Then 912 + 19=931, but I already used 19. Wait, the numbers are 8,16,19,98. So if I do 16×19=304. Then 304 + 98=402. 402 × (8/ something). Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe 98 ×19= 1862. That's way larger than 931. Then subtract something. 1862 - (16×8)=1862-128=1734. No, that's still too big. Alternatively, 98 × (19 - (16 /8)) = 98 × (19 - 2)=98×17=1666. Still way over.\n\nHmm. Maybe I need a different approach. Let's try to break down 931. 931 divided by 19 is 49. So 19 × 49=931. So if I can get 49 from 8,16,98. But I have to use all numbers. Wait, but 98 is already part of 19×49=931. Wait, but how?\n\nWait, 49 is 98/2. So 19 × (98/2) =19×49=931. But 2 could be from 16 divided by 8. Because 16/8=2. So putting it all together: 19 × (98 / (16 /8)) )=19×(98/2)=19×49=931. Let's check that. Let's compute 16 divided by 8 first: 16/8=2. Then 98 divided by 2=49. Then 19×49=931. Yes! That works. So the equation is 19 × (98 ÷ (16 ÷ 8)) =931. Let me verify each number is used once: 19,98,16,8. Yes, all used once. The operations are division inside the parentheses and multiplication. So that's the correct equation.\n</think>\n\n<answer>19 * (98 / (16 / 8))</answer>"}]}

Maybe subtract instead? 105 -59=46. Not helpful.\n\nWhat if I subtract first? Let's try 61-21=40. Then 44+38=82. 40*82 would be way too big. 40+82=122. Not enough. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe multiply 44 and 38. 44*38=1672, which is way over. Maybe divide? 44/38 is about 1.157. Not helpful. How about 61*38? 61*38=2318. That's way too high. Maybe subtract some numbers from that? But even if I subtract 44 and 21, 2318-44-21=2253. Still way off.\n\nWait, maybe combining operations. Let's think about 190. It's 190=200-10. Or 190=19*10. Or 38*5=190. Wait, 38 is one of the numbers. So if I can get 38 multiplied by 5, then maybe. How to get 5 from the remaining numbers: 44,61,21. Hmm. 44- (61-21) =44-40=4. Not 5. 61-44=17, 21-17=4. Not helpful. 21/ (61-44)=21/17≈1.235. Not 5. Maybe (44 + 21)/ (something). 44+21=65. 65 divided by 13 is 5. But I don't have 13. Wait, 61- something. 61-38=23. 65/23≈2.8. Not 5. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 61 - (44 / something). Let's see, 44 divided by 11 is 4. 61-4=57. 57*3=171. Hmm, but 3 from where? 21/7=3. But I don't have 7. Wait, 38-21=17. Not helpful. Maybe another approach.\n\nWhat if I take 61 and 38. 61+38=99. Then 44+21=65. 99+65=164. Still not 190. If I subtract, 99-65=34. No.\n\nAnother angle: 44*4=176. If I can get 176 and then add 14. But how? 61-38=23. 23-21=2. 176+2=178. Not 190. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe 44 multiplied by something. Let's see, 44*4=176. Then 176 +14=190. So how to get 14 from the remaining numbers. The remaining numbers would be 61,38,21. Let's see: 38- (61-21)=38-40= -2. Not helpful. 61 -38=23. 23-21=2. Not 14. 21 - (61-38)=21-23=-2. No. Maybe 21/ (61-38)=21/23≈0.913. Not useful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 44*5=220. Then subtract 30. 220-30=190. How to get 5 and 30 from the other numbers. Let's see, 61,38,21. 38-21=17. 61 divided by 17≈3.588. Not 5. 61-38=23. 23-21=2. 2* something? 2*15=30. But how to get 15. Not sure. Maybe this isn't the right path.\n\nWait, let's try using division more effectively. Suppose I take 61 and 21. 61 -21=40. Then maybe 40 multiplied by something. 40*4.75=190. How to get 4.75 from 44 and 38. Let me see, 44 divided by something. 44 divided by 38 is about 1.157. 44 divided by (38 - x)? Not sure. Alternatively, 38 divided by 8 is 4.75. But how to get 8. 44- (something). 44- (61-21)=44-40=4. Not 8. Maybe 44 - 38=6. 6 is not 8. Hmm.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe 61*3=183. Then 183 +7=190. So 3 and 7. How to get those. 44-38=6. 21 divided by (6)=3.5. Not 3. Alternatively, 38-21=17. 44 divided by 17≈2.588. Not 3. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps subtract two larger numbers. Let's think: 61*44=2684. That's way too big. 61-44=17. Then 17* something. 17*11=187. 187+3=190. How to get 11 and 3. 38-21=17. Wait, but I already used 17. Not sure. Maybe 38/21≈1.809. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 44* (61 - (38 +21)). Let's calculate inside the parentheses: 61 -59=2. So 44*2=88. Not enough.\n\nWhat about (44 +61) - (38 +21)=105 -59=46. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe combine multiplication and addition. For example, (44 * 38) + (61 -21). Let's compute: 44*38=1672, 61-21=40. 1672+40=1712. Way too big.\n\nAlternatively, (44 +61) * something. 105 * something=190. 190/105≈1.809. How to get that from 38 and 21. 38/21≈1.809. Oh! Wait, so 105*(38/21)=105*(1.809)=190. Let me check: 38 divided by 21 is approximately 1.8095. 105 * 1.8095 ≈ 190. So 105*(38/21)= (44 +61) * (38 /21)=190. Let me compute this exactly. 38/21 is 38/21=1.8095238... Multiply by 105: 105*(38/21)= (105/21)*38=5*38=190. Yes! That works. Because 105 divided by 21 is 5, then 5*38=190. So the equation would be (44 + 61) * (38 / 21) = 190. Let me verify each number is used once: 44,61,38,21. Yes, all used. Operations are +, *, /. Perfect. So that's the equation.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(44 + 61) * (38 / 21) = 190</answer>"}]}

Hmm, let's think.\n\nFirst, 921 is a bit close to 438. Maybe I can use 438 as a base and add or subtract the other numbers. Let's see: 438 plus 210 is 648, which is too low. 438 plus 92 is 530, still not enough. 438 multiplied by something... 438*2 is 876, but how can I get 2 from the remaining numbers? Maybe 210 divided by 40 gives 5.25, which doesn't help. Maybe subtract 40 from 210 to get 170, then add that to 438? 438+170=608, still not enough.\n\nWait, maybe a combination of multiplication and addition. Let's see. If I take 210 and multiply it by something. 210*4=840, but 921-840=81. Do I have 81 left? Not exactly. The remaining numbers are 40,92,438. Maybe 210*4 + (something). Wait, perhaps 210*4.5? But I don't have a 4.5. Alternatively, 210*5=1050, which is over. So perhaps subtract something. 210*5 - (something) = 921. Let's see: 1050 - 921 = 129. Can I make 129 from 40, 92, 438? Hmm, 438 divided by something. 438/40=10.95, which doesn't help. Maybe 92 + 40 = 132, which is close to 129. But 132 is 3 more. Not quite. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use division. Let's see. 438 is a large number. If I do 438 * 2 = 876, but how to get 876 and then add or subtract. Wait, 876 + 210 = 1086, which is over. 438 + 210 = 648. Then 648 + 92 = 740. Still low. 740 +40=780. Still not 921.\n\nWait, maybe subtract some numbers. 438 * 2 = 876. Then 876 + (210 - 92). Let's calculate 210-92=118. So 876 +118=994. That's 994. Still not 921. Hmm. How far is that? 994-921=73. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 210 * 4. Let's see: 210*4=840. 840 + 92 =932. Close. 932-40=892. Not enough. 932-11=921. But where do I get 11? Not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps combine 438 and 92. 438 +92=530. Then 530 * something. 530 *1.7 would be around 901. Not helpful. Maybe 530 + 210=740. Then 740 +40=780. Still low.\n\nWait, let's think differently. Maybe multiply two numbers and then add/subtract the others. Let's see possible products:\n\n40 * 210 = 8400. Way too big.\n\n40 * 92 = 3680. Also way too big.\n\n40 *438= 17520. Nope.\n\n210*92=19320. Still way too big.\n\n210*438=91980. Way over.\n\n92*438=40296. No.\n\nSo maybe multiplication isn't the way. Maybe division. Let's see:\n\n438 divided by something. 438/40=10.95. 438/210≈2.0857. 438/92≈4.76.\n\nMaybe 210 divided by 40=5.25. Then 5.25 *92=483. 483 +438=921. Wait, that's interesting. Let me check:\n\n210 /40 =5.25. Then 5.25 *92 =5.25*92=483. Then 483 +438=921. Yes! But wait, are we allowed to use decimal points or fractions? The problem says basic arithmetic operations, so division can result in fractions. But do we have to use integer operations? The example given in the problem uses (1+2)/3, which is 1, so perhaps fractions are allowed.\n\nBut let's confirm. If we do (210 /40)*92 +438. Let's compute step by step:\n\n210 divided by40 is 5.25. Multiply by92: 5.25*92=483. Then 483 +438=921. Exactly. So that's 921. So all numbers are used: 210,40,92,438. Each once. The operations are division, multiplication, and addition.\n\nSo the equation would be (210 / 40) * 92 +438 =921. Let me check that again. 210 divided by40 is 5.25. Multiply by92: 5.25*92. Let's compute 92*5=460, 92*0.25=23, so total 460+23=483. Then 483+438=921. Correct.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the order of operations is correct. Since multiplication and division have the same precedence, so it should be evaluated left to right. So (210 /40) is 5.25, then multiplied by92. Then add438. Yes, that works. So the equation is (210 / 40 * 92) +438 =921. Alternatively, to make it clearer, maybe ( (210 / 40 ) * 92 ) + 438 =921. But parentheses are used to clarify order. But according to standard order, division and multiplication are left associative, so the parentheses as (210/40)*92 would be correct.\n\nSo the answer would be (210 / 40 * 92) + 438 = 921. But the problem says to return the equation in the answer tags. Let me format it properly. But the example shows something like (1+2)/3. So using parentheses as needed. So maybe ((210 / 40) * 92) + 438 =921. But we can write it as (210 / 40 * 92) + 438. Wait, but I need to ensure that the order is correct. Let's confirm:\n\nIf written as 210 /40 *92 +438. Without parentheses, it's ((210 /40)*92)+438, which is correct. So maybe just that. But since the problem allows using one or multiple operations, and the numbers each once.\n\nYes, that works. So the equation is 210 / 40 * 92 + 438 =921. But in the answer, we need to include all numbers. Wait, in the example, they used all numbers. So let's check again:\n\nNumbers used: 210,40,92,438. All four. Yes. The operations are /, *, +. So that's three operations. Each number used once. Perfect.\n\nSo the equation is ((210 / 40) * 92) + 438 =921. Alternatively, (210 /40 *92) +438. Either way. Let me just write it with parentheses to make the order clear, so that it's unambiguous.\n</think>\n\n<answer>((210 / 40) * 92) + 438 = 921</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using all the numbers 6, 98, 49, 54 exactly once, with basic operations, to get 471. Hmm. First, maybe I should think about the target number 471 and see how these numbers can combine. Let's look at the numbers given: 98 is a big one, 49 is half of 98, 54 is a bit over 50, and 6 is small. \n\nWell, 471 is a bit less than 500. Let's see. If I can get close to 500 and then adjust. For example, 98 times 5 is 490, but we don't have a 5. Wait, 54 divided by 6 is 9. Maybe that's useful. So 54 / 6 = 9. Then 98 + 9 is 107, but not sure how that helps. Alternatively, 98 times 5 would be 490, which is 19 away from 471. But how to get 5? Maybe 49 - 44? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe use subtraction. Let's think.\n\nAnother approach: 54 times 9 is 486, which is 15 more than 471. But how to get 9. Wait, 54 divided by 6 is 9. Then 54/6=9. So 54*9 would be 54*(54/6) which is 54*9=486. Then 486 minus something? 486 - 15=471. But where do I get 15 from the remaining numbers. Wait, if I use 54/6 as 9, then I have used 54 and 6. The remaining numbers are 98 and 49. How to get 15 from 98 and 49? 49 - (98/ something). Hmm, 98 divided by something. 98 divided by 7 is 14, but I don't have a 7. Alternatively, 98 - 49 is 49, which isn't helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 98 minus 49 is 49. Then 486 - 49 = 437, which is not 471. Hmm. Maybe another order.\n\nWait, what if I use 98 * 5 = 490, then 490 - 19 = 471. But again, where to get 5 and 19? Let's think differently. Maybe use multiplication and addition. 49 * 9 is 441, then add 30 to get 471. How to get 30? 54 - 24? But 24 would require 6*4, but we don't have 4. Or 54 - (98/ something). 98 divided by 6 is about 16.333. So 54 - (98/6) would be 54 - 16.333 ≈ 37.666, which isn't 30. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe 54 * 9 = 486, then subtract 15. 15 could be 49 - (98/6's something). Wait, if I have 49 - (98/ something). Let me check: 98 divided by 6 is approximately 16.333. So 49 - 16.333 is 32.666. Not 15. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, 98 - 54 = 44. Then 44 * something. 44 * 10.7 is around 471, but that's messy. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe combine operations. Let's see:\n\nLet's try 98 * 6 = 588. Then 588 - 49 = 539. Then 539 - 54 = 485. No, that's not 471. Or 588 - (49 +54) = 588 - 103=485. Still no.\n\nWhat if we do 98 + 49 = 147. Then 147 * something. 147 * 3 is 441. Then 441 + 30 = 471. But 30 can be 54 - 24. But 24 is 6*4. But 4 isn't available. Alternatively, 54 / (something). 54 / 6 is 9. So 147 * 3 + 54 /6. Wait, but how to get 3. Wait, but 147*3 would be 441, then adding 9 (54/6) would be 450. Not 471. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I need to use division in a way that gives a larger number. For example, 54 / 6 =9. Then 49 * 9 =441. Then 441 + 98=539. That's over. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 98 * (54 /6) =98*9=882. Then 882 -49=833, which is way over. No.\n\nWait, 49 * 6=294. Then 294 +98=392. Then 392 +54=446. Still not.\n\nAlternatively, 54 * 6=324. 324 +49=373. 373 +98=471. Oh wait! 54*6=324, then 324 +49=373, then 373 +98=471. Wait, but that uses all numbers except 6 is used in 54*6, so 54,6,49,98. All four numbers. Let's check: 54*6=324. Then 324 +49=373. Then 373 +98=471. Yes! That works. Wait, but each number is used once. 54,6,49,98. So the equation would be 54*6 +49 +98=471. Wait, but that adds them all. Let me compute:\n\n54*6 = 324\n\n324 +49=373\n\n373 +98=471.\n\nYes! That adds up. But are all numbers used exactly once? Yes: 54,6,49,98. So the equation is 54*6 +49 +98=471. Let me check again:\n\n54×6=324. 324+49=373. 373+98=471. Correct. So that's the equation. But wait, the problem says \"create an equation\" using each number once. So that would be (54 * 6) + 49 + 98 = 471. Or written as 54*6 +49 +98. But since the numbers are used once each, and all operations are allowed. So this works. But let me check if that's acceptable. The problem says you can use operations multiple times but each number once. So yes, multiplication and addition here. So the equation is (54 × 6) + 49 + 98 = 471. So I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\n<answer>54 * 6 + 49 + 98 = 471</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using all the numbers 55, 75, 458, 10 exactly once, and the result should be 318. The operations allowed are +, -, *, /, and each number can be used only once. Hmm, how to approach this?\n\nFirst, maybe I should think about what combinations could get close to 318. Let me list the numbers: 55, 75, 458, 10. 458 is the largest, so maybe that's a starting point. If I subtract something from 458 to get close to 318. Let's see, 458 - 140 is 318. So maybe I need to make 140 using 55, 75, and 10. Wait, but 55, 75, and 10. Let's see: 75 + 55 is 130, plus 10 is 140. Oh! So 458 - (75 + 55 + 10) equals 458 - 140 = 318. But wait, that uses all four numbers: 458, 75, 55, 10. But the problem says each number can be used once, and we must use all. So yes, that works. Wait, but the operations allowed are +, -, *, /. So adding those three numbers and subtracting the sum from 458. So the equation would be 458 - (75 + 55 + 10) = 318. Let me check the arithmetic: 75 + 55 is 130, plus 10 is 140. 458 - 140 is indeed 318. So that seems to work. But the problem requires using all four numbers and each only once. In this case, all numbers are used once. So the equation would be 458 - 75 - 55 - 10 = 318. Alternatively, written with parentheses as 458 - (75 + 55 + 10). But maybe that's the simplest way. Let me check if there's another way, just to make sure. Alternatively, could I use multiplication or division? Let's think. Maybe 458 divided by something. 458 ÷ 10 is 45.8. Not helpful. 458 - (75 * something). Let's see, 75 * 5 is 375. 458 - 375 = 83. Not helpful. What if I use 55 and 10. 55 * 10 is 550. That's too big. 55 / 10 is 5.5. Maybe 458 - (75 * (55/10))? Let's calculate that. 55/10 is 5.5. 75 * 5.5 is 412.5. 458 - 412.5 is 45.5. Not 318. Hmm. Another approach: Maybe combine 458 and 75 first. 458 - 75 is 383. Then subtract something else. 383 - 55 is 328. Then subtract 10 is 318. Wait, that works: 458 - 75 - 55 -10 = 318. That's the same as before, but written step by step. So that's a valid equation. Let me check again: 458 -75 is 383. 383 -55 is 328. 328 -10 is 318. Yep. So that uses all numbers once with subtraction. But I need to use each number exactly once and all of them. So in this equation, each number is used once. So maybe that's the solution. Alternatively, maybe there's another combination using multiplication or division. Let me try. For example, 55 * 75 is 4125. That's way too big. 458 - 4125 would be negative. Not helpful. How about 75 - 55 = 20. Then 458 - (20 * something). If I use 10, maybe 20 * 10 = 200. 458 -200=258. Not 318. Alternatively, 458 divided by 10 is 45.8. Then 75 - 45.8 is 29.2. Then 55 +29.2=84.2. Not helpful. Hmm. Maybe 55 * (10 - something). Let's see, 10 - (something). Maybe 75 and 458. Wait, but I need to use all numbers. Let's see, perhaps (458 - 75) / 10 +55. Let's compute: 458 -75=383. 383/10=38.3. 38.3 +55=93.3. Not 318. Alternatively, 458 - (75 * (55 /10)). Wait, did I try that earlier? 55/10=5.5, 75*5.5=412.5, 458-412.5=45.5. No. How about 55 * (75 - 458 /10). Let's see: 458 /10=45.8. 75 -45.8=29.2. 55*29.2=1606. Way too big. No. Maybe 458 - 75 - (55 *10). Let's check. 55*10=550. 458-75=383. 383-550= -167. Not helpful. What about (458 +75) - (55*10). 458+75=533. 55*10=550. 533-550= -17. Nope. Alternatively, 458 - (75 +55) * (10). 75+55=130. 130*10=1300. 458-1300= -842. No. Hmm. Let me think again. The first solution I found works: 458 -75 -55 -10=318. That uses all four numbers exactly once with subtraction operations. Is that acceptable? The problem says we can use operations one or multiple times. So subtraction is allowed multiple times. So that equation is valid. Let me just confirm that the problem allows multiple uses of the same operation, which it does. So the equation 458 -75 -55 -10=318. But wait, the numbers are all used once each, and the operations are subtraction three times. So that's acceptable. Let me check once more: 458-75 is 383. 383-55 is 328. 328-10 is 318. Correct. So this equation should work. Therefore, the answer would be (458 - 75 - 55 - 10) = 318. But according to the example, they put the equation in the answer tags without the result. So it should be written as an expression. So the equation would be 458 - 75 - 55 - 10. Alternatively, maybe with parentheses: (458 - 75) - 55 -10, but it's the same result. Alternatively, grouping them as 458 - (75 + 55 +10). That's also the same. Let's check: 75 +55+10=140. 458-140=318. So maybe writing it as 458 - (75 +55 +10). That's another way. Either way is correct. Let's see which one is more concise. Using the parentheses might be better. So perhaps the answer is 458 - (75 + 55 + 10). Let me verify again: 75+55=130, +10=140. 458-140=318. Yep. That's correct. So that's the equation. I think that's the solution.\n</think>\n\n<answer>458 - (75 + 55 + 10)</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using the numbers 70, 61, 593, and 75, each exactly once, with basic arithmetic operations to get 799. Hmm. Let me start by thinking about the target number, 799. Maybe breaking it down into parts would help. \n\nFirst, 799 is close to 800, which is 8*100. But I don't have a 100 here. Alternatively, maybe 800 - 1? But how to get that. Let me check the numbers again. 593 is the largest number here. If I subtract something from 593, maybe. 593 - 75 = 518. Not helpful. 593 + 75 = 668. Still not close. What if I multiply some numbers? Let's see.\n\n70 multiplied by something. 70*11 is 770, which is near 799. But 11 isn't directly available. Wait, 70*11 + 29 would be 799. But where would 29 come from? Maybe from 61 and 75? Let me see. 61 - (75/ something). Hmm. Alternatively, 70* (something) plus another number.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 593 + 70 = 663. Then 663 + 75 = 738. Then 738 + 61 = 799? Wait, 593 +70=663, 663+75=738, 738+61=799. Oh, that actually works! But wait, that's just adding all of them. Wait, 593 +70 +75 +61. Let me compute that: 593+70=663, 663+75=738, 738+61=799. Yes! But does that use each number once and all numbers? Yes. But that would be 593 +70 +75 +61 =799. So the equation is just adding all four numbers. Wait, but the problem says \"create an equation that equals 799\" using each number once with operations. But addition is allowed. So maybe that's the solution. Let me check the sum:\n\n593 + 70 = 663\n\n663 + 75 = 738\n\n738 + 61 = 799.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the equation is 593 + 70 + 75 + 61 = 799. But wait, the problem says \"using basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) one or multiple times\". So if I just use addition, that's allowed. But since all the numbers are being added, the equation would be 593 + 70 + 75 + 61. But let me verify if I have to combine them with operations. For example, maybe using parentheses or different operations. But in this case, adding all of them works. Let me check again the sum:\n\n593 + 70 = 663\n\n663 +75=738\n\n738 +61=799. Yep, exactly. So the answer is simply adding all four numbers. But maybe the problem expects a more complex equation with a mix of operations. Let me see if that's possible, just to be thorough.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 75* something. 75*10=750, which is less than 799. 75*10 + 49=799. 49 could be from 70 -21, but not sure. Alternatively, 75*11=825. 825 - 26=799. 26 from 61 and others? Not obvious.\n\nAnother approach: 593 + (70 * something). 70*3=210. 593 +210=803. Close to 799. 803 -4=799. But where to get the 4? Maybe 75-61=14. Then 14 / something. 14 /3.5=4. But that would require using 3.5, which isn't one of the numbers. Hmm. Not helpful.\n\nWait, 75 - 61 =14. So 593 + (70 * (something)) -14. Let me see. Let's say 70*10=700. 593 +700=1293. That's way over. Maybe subtract. 70* (593 / something). That's getting complicated. \n\nAnother angle: 799 is 800-1. How to get 800 and subtract 1. 800 could be 70*11 + 30. Not helpful. Or 75*10 +50. But how? Alternatively, 593 + 207 =800. 207=70+137. 137 might be 75+62. But 62 isn't available. Wait, 75 +61=136. 70 +136=206. 593 +206=799. So 593 + (70 +75 +61) = 593 +206=799. Which is the same as before. So that's the same equation. So the equation can be written as 593 +70 +75 +61=799, or 593 + (70 +75 +61)=799. Either way, it's just addition. \n\nIs there another way? Let me see. Let's check if using multiplication or division can help. For example, maybe 75*10 + (593 - 70 -61). Wait, 75*10 is 750. 593 -70=523, 523-61=462. 750 +462=1212, which is not 799. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 70*11=770. 770 +29=799. How to get 29. 75 -61=14. 14 +15=29. But 15 is not available. Alternatively, 593 - (something)=29. 593-564=29. But 564 would need to be made from 70, 61,75. 70*8=560, 560 +4=564. 4 from 75-61=14, 14/3.5 again. Not useful. \n\nAlternatively, 61*(something). 61*13=793. 793+6=799. 6 from 75-70=5, but that's not enough. Alternatively, 61*13=793, then 793 + (75-70)=798, which is 1 less. Not helpful.\n\nHmm. Maybe trying division. For example, 593 + (75 / something). 75/1=75. 593+75=668. Then 668 +70=738, plus 61=799 again. Same as before. But that's just addition again. If I use division but actually, 75 divided by something. Let's see. Suppose we do 75 divided by 25, but 25 isn't a number here. \n\nAlternatively, 70 - (something). If I subtract 61 from 70, that's 9. Then 593 +9=602. Then 602 +75=677. Not helpful. \n\nWait, maybe multiply two numbers. Let's see. 70*75=5250. That's way too big. 70*61=4270. Still too big. 593* something. 593*1=593. Adding 70+75+61=206. 593+206=799. Which is again the same as before. So maybe that's the only way. \n\nSo the answer is simply adding all four numbers. Let me check again: 593 +70 is 663, +75 is 738, +61 is 799. Yep, correct. So the equation is 593 +70 +75 +61 =799. But since the problem allows using operations multiple times, and each number once, this seems acceptable. So the answer is just the sum of all four numbers.\n</think>\n\n<answer>593 + 70 + 75 + 61 = 799</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using the numbers 69, 81, 13, and 70 exactly once each, and combine them with basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) to get 754. Hmm, 754 is a pretty big number, so maybe multiplication is involved here. Let me start by checking if there's a way to multiply two of these numbers to get close to 754.\n\nFirst, let's see the larger numbers here: 81 and 70. If I multiply 81 by 70, that gives 5670, which is way too big. But maybe combining that with another number? Wait, but 5670 minus something else would still be too large. Maybe that's not the right approach.\n\nHow about 69 multiplied by something? 69 times 11 is 759, which is close to 754. But I don't have an 11. Wait, maybe 69 times 13? Let's calculate that: 69*13. Let me do 70*13 = 910, subtract 1*13, so 910-13=897. That's 897, which is bigger than 754. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe subtract some numbers. Let's see, if I take 81 and 70, maybe 81*70 is 5670, then subtract other numbers. But 5670 minus 69 and 13 would be 5670 - 82 = 5588, which is way off. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe I need to combine operations. Let's think. What if I use multiplication and addition? For example, (81 * something) plus something else. Let's see. If I do 81*9 = 729, which is close to 754, but I need to get 25 more. But how can I get 9 and 25 from the remaining numbers? Hmm, not directly. Wait, maybe 81 multiplied by 70 divided by some number? Let's see: 81*70=5670. If I divide that by, say, 13, that's 5670/13 ≈ 436.15, which isn't helpful. Then adding 69, but that would give around 505.15. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 81*13. Let's calculate that: 81*10=810, 81*3=243, so 810+243=1053. Then subtract 70 and 69. 1053 -70=983, 983-69=914. That's still way off. Not good.\n\nWhat if I do 70*13? That's 910. Then subtract something. 910 - 69 = 841. Then subtract 81? 841-81=760. Close to 754 but still 6 off. Maybe another approach.\n\nWait, 69*13 is 897, as I calculated earlier. Then subtract 70 and 81? 897 -70=827, 827-81=746. That's 8 less than 754. Not quite. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe 70*13 is 910. Then subtract (81 - 69). Let's see: 81-69=12. So 910 -12=898. Still not 754.\n\nAlternatively, 70* (something). Let me think. 70*10=700. 754-700=54. So if I can get 54 from the other numbers. 81-13=68. 81-13=68. 69-13=56. Hmm. 81- (69/ something). Wait, 69 divided by 13 is about 5.3. 81 -5.3=75.7. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe 81 + 13 =94. Then 70*94=6580. That's way too big. Not useful.\n\nAlternatively, 70*81 is 5670. Divide by 13: 5670/13 ≈436.15. Then add 69: ≈505.15. Not helpful.\n\nHmm. Maybe using division to get a higher number. Let's see, if I do (81 +70) =151. Then 151 * something. 151*5=755. Oh, that's very close to 754. So 151*5=755. Then subtract 1. But how can I get 5 and 1 from the remaining numbers? The remaining numbers would be 69 and 13. Wait, 69 and 13. Let's see. 69 divided by 13 is approximately 5.307. If I could do 151*(69/13). Let's compute that. 69/13=5.307. Then 151*5.307≈ 151*5 +151*0.307 ≈755 +46.357≈801.357. Not helpful. But if I could somehow make 5 and then subtract 1. Maybe 69 - 13=56. Not 5. Wait, 13 - (69/70). That's messy. Maybe not.\n\nWait, but 151*(5) is 755, which is just 1 more than 754. So if I can do 151*5 -1 =754. How can I get 5 and 1 from 69 and 13? Let's see. 69 divided by 13 is 5.307, which is approximately 5. So maybe 69//13 (integer division) gives 5. Then 151*(69//13) -1. But we can't use integer division, only standard operations. So 69/13=5.307. But if we can't use floor functions, that's not allowed. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (81 +70) * (69 /13) - something. Let's compute. 81+70=151. 69/13≈5.307. 151*5.307≈801. Then 801 minus what? But the remaining number is 70 or 81, but we already used all numbers. Wait, no: the numbers used are 81,70,69,13. So that's all of them. So (81+70)*(69/13) = approx 801. Then we can't subtract anything else because all numbers are used. So that's not going to work.\n\nHmm. Maybe a different approach. Let's think. 754 is the target. Let's break it down. 700 +54. How to get 700 from one part and 54 from another. For example, 70*10=700. Then 54 can be from 81-27=54. But how to get 27 from 69 and 13. 69-13=56. No. 13*2=26. Not 27. Maybe 69/ (something). 69/ (13/ something). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, 69*13=897. Then 897 - 70=827. 827-81=746. Not enough.\n\nWait, 754 divided by 13 is 58. So 13*58=754. So if I can get 58 from 69,81,70. Let's see. 69 +81=150, 150-70=80. Not 58. 81-70=11, 69-11=58. Ah, here's a thought. 81-70=11, then 69-11=58. Then 58*13=754. Let's check:\n\n69 - (81 -70) =69 -11=58. Then 58*13=754. Yes, that works! Let's write that out: (69 - (81 -70)) *13 = (69 -11)*13 =58*13=754. And all numbers are used once: 69,81,70,13. Perfect. So the equation is (69 - (81 -70)) *13=754. Let's verify again:\n\n81-70=11\n\n69-11=58\n\n58*13=754. Yes, that's correct. All numbers used once with operations. Perfect.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(69 - (81 - 70)) * 13 = 754</answer>"}]}

I need to use the numbers 26, 1, 25, and 19 each exactly once, and combine them with basic arithmetic operations to get 32. Hmm. Let's start by thinking about possible combinations.\n\nFirst, 26 is close to 25, maybe subtracting them? But 26 - 25 is 1, which we already have. That doesn't seem helpful. Alternatively, adding 25 and 19 gives 44, which is higher than 32. Maybe subtract something from that. If I do 25 + 19 = 44, then subtract 26 and 1? Wait, 44 - 26 is 18, then 18 -1 is 17. Not 32.\n\nWhat if I multiply some numbers. Let's see. 25 is a big number. If I can multiply 25 by something. Like 25 * 1 is 25. Then add 26 and 19? 25 +26=51, plus 19 is 70. No. Alternatively, 25 * 1 + (26 -19). That would be 25 + 7 =32. Wait, 26-19 is 7. So 25 +7 is 32. Oh! So that uses 25, 1, 26, and 19. Let me check: 25 + (26 -19) +1? Wait, no, if I do 25 *1 + (26 -19) =25 +7=32. But that uses 25, 1, 26, 19. All four numbers. Each used once. So the equation would be 25*1 +26 -19 =32. Let me check: 25*1 is 25, then 25+26 is 51, 51-19 is 32. Wait, no. Wait, that's not correct. Wait, 25 multiplied by 1 is 25, then adding 26 gives 25+26=51, then subtracting 19 gives 51-19=32. Yes! So the equation is 25*1 +26 -19 =32. Let me verify all numbers are used once: 25,1,26,19. Yes, all used. Operations are multiplication, addition, subtraction. So that works. Let me write it properly: (25 * 1) + 26 - 19 = 32. But maybe another way to arrange parentheses. Alternatively, 25 *1 + (26 -19) =25 +7=32. That also works. Either way. So the answer would be 25*1 +26 -19. Or perhaps 25 + (26 -19) +1? Wait, no, that would be 25 +7 +1=33. Not 32. So the correct one is 25*1 +26 -19. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. 25*1 is 25. Then 25 +26=51. 51-19=32. Yes, correct. So that's the equation. Alternatively, maybe another combination. Let me check. For example, 26 - (25 -19) +1. Let's calculate: 25-19=6, 26-6=20, 20+1=21. No. Not 32. What if 26 +19 -25 +1? That's 26+19=45, 45-25=20, 20+1=21. Still no. How about (26 -1) + (25 -19). 25-19=6, 26-1=25, 25+6=31. Close, but not 32. Hmm. Another approach: 19 + something. 19 +13=32. So maybe 26 - (25 / something). Wait, 25 divided by 1 is 25. So 26 -25=1, then 1 +19=20. No. Not helpful. Alternatively, 19 + (26 - (25 /1))=19 + (26-25)=19 +1=20. Still no. What if I do 26 + (25 / (19 -1)). Let's see 19-1=18. 25/18 is about 1.388... 26 +1.388 is around 27.388. Not 32. Hmm. Another idea: 26 * something. 26 *1 is 26. 25 -19=6. 26 +6=32. So 26*1 +25 -19. That's the same as before. Wait, 26*1 is 26. 25-19 is 6. 26+6=32. Yes. So equation is 26*1 +25 -19. Wait, but 26*1 uses 26 and 1, then 25 and 19 are subtracted. So 26*1 +25 -19 =26 +25 -19 =51-19=32. But that uses all four numbers? Wait, 26,1,25,19. Yes, all used once. So that's another possible equation. So either 25*1 +26 -19 or 26*1 +25 -19. Both result in 32. Let me check both. First equation: 25*1=25, then +26=51, -19=32. Correct. Second equation: 26*1=26, +25=51, -19=32. Also correct. So either equation would work. But the problem requires using all four numbers. So either way, as long as all four numbers are used once. So for example, (25 * 1) +26 -19. Or (26 *1) +25 -19. Both are valid. But let's check if the problem allows using the same operations. So multiplication is used once, addition and subtraction once each. So either way, it's valid. But maybe the user expects a specific arrangement. Alternatively, perhaps a different combination. Let me see. Another approach: (19 - (25 -26)) *1. Let's compute 25-26=-1, then 19 - (-1)=20, 20*1=20. No. Not 32. How about (26 - (25 -19)) +1. 25-19=6, 26-6=20, 20+1=21. No. Not helpful. Alternatively, 25 + (26 / (19 -1)). 19-1=18. 26/18≈1.444. 25+1.444≈26.444. Not 32. Hmm. Maybe 26 + (25 -19) +1. 25-19=6, 26+6=32, then +1=33. No. Close, but over. Alternatively, 25 + (19 - (26 /1)). 26/1=26, 19-26=-7, 25 +(-7)=18. Not. Maybe 19 + (26 - (25 /1)). 25/1=25, 26-25=1, 19+1=20. No. So the only combinations that work are the ones I found earlier. So the equation can be written as either 25*1 +26 -19 or 26*1 +25 -19. Either way, both are correct. Let's pick one. Let's go with 25*1 +26 -19. Because 25*1 uses 25 and 1, then 26 and 19. So all numbers are used once. So the equation is (25 * 1) + 26 - 19 =32. That works.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(25 * 1) + 26 - 19 = 32</answer>"}]}

Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should recall that 145 is the target. Let me see what combinations of these numbers can get close. Maybe breaking it down: 145 is between 90 and 47. Let's see, 90 plus something. 90 + 47 is 137, which is under 145. 90 + 35 = 125. Hmm. 47 + 35 = 82, plus 90 is 172, which is over. So maybe subtraction or division can help adjust.\n\nAlternatively, multiplication might help. Let's see: 47 * 3 would be 141, but 3 isn't one of the numbers. Wait, but maybe combining numbers. For example, 47 * (something) to get near 145. 47 * 3 = 141, which is 4 less than 145. But how to get 3 from the remaining numbers. The remaining numbers would be 7, 90, 35. Hmm, 35 - 7 is 28, which is not 3. 90 divided by 35 is roughly 2.57. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe another approach. Let's see: 90 and 35. 90 - 35 = 55. Then 55 + 47 = 102. Still not enough. If I multiply 55 by something. But 55 * 7 is 385, which is way over. Not helpful.\n\nWhat if I do 90 + 47 = 137. Then 137 + (35 / 7). 35 divided by 7 is 5. So 137 +5 = 142. Close, but not 145. So 142 is 3 short. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I need to use multiplication or division in a different way. Let's try 90 + (47 - 7) * something. 47-7=40. 40 * 3.5 = 140. But 3.5 is 35/10, but how to get that. Wait, 35 divided by something. Maybe 35 divided by 10. But I don't have a 10. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, 35 multiplied by something. 35 *4=140. Then 140 +5=145. But where to get the 4 and 5. Let's see, remaining numbers would be 7,47,90. If I use 47-7=40, 40 divided by 10=4. But 10 isn't available. Wait, 90 divided by something. 90 divided by 10 is 9. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 90 divided by (something) to get a useful number. Let's see: 90 / 7 ≈12.857. Not helpful. 90/35≈2.571. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps 47 * 3 = 141, and then add 4. But where to get 3 and 4. Let's see, 35 divided by 7 is 5. 5- something. Hmm, 35/7=5, then 5 - 2=3. But where to get 2. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 90 - 35 =55. Then 55 * 2 =110, but how to get 2 from 47 and 7. 47 -7=40, but 40 isn't 2. Hmm.\n\nWait another angle: Let's see if combining 47 and 35. 47 +35=82. Then 82 + something. 82 +90=172, which is over. Then subtract 7: 172-7=165. Still over. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 90 +35=125. 125 +47=172. Again, too high. Subtract 7: 172-7=165. Still no.\n\nWhat if we do multiplication. Let's think: 7 * 47=329. Then 329 - (90 +35)=329 -125=204. Not 145. Hmm. Alternatively, 7 * 47=329. 329 -90=239. 239 -35=204. Still same.\n\nWait, 47 * 3 =141. If I can get 141 from 47 and some combination, then add 4. Let's see, 141 +4=145. How to get 141. Well, 47*3. But how to get 3 from 7,90,35. 35 divided by 7 is 5. 5 - (something). If I subtract 2. But where to get 2? 90 divided by 45 is 2. But I don't have 45. Alternatively, 90 minus 35 is 55. 55 divided by something. Hmm, not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 90 - (something). Let's think: 90 - (35/7) =90-5=85. Then 85 +47=132. Still under. Not enough.\n\nWait, perhaps 35 * something. 35*4=140. Then 140 +5=145. The 4 could be 7 -3. But where to get 3. 90 divided by something. 90 divided by 30=3. But 30 isn't present. Alternatively, 47-44=3. But 44 isn't here. Hmm.\n\nAnother approach: Let's try to use all operations. For example, combining addition and subtraction. Let's see: (90 + 47) - (35 -7). That would be 137 -28=109. Not 145.\n\nOr (90 - 35) + (47 * something). 90-35=55. 55 +47=102. Still not.\n\nWait, maybe (47 + 35) * something. 47+35=82. 82 * something. If 82*1.76≈145. But 1.76 is 145/82≈1.77. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 90 / (something) + other numbers. 90 divided by 7 is about 12.85. 12.85 +47=59.85 +35=94.85. No.\n\nWait, let's try division and multiplication. Let's see: 35 /7=5. Then 5*47=235. Then 235 -90=145. Wait, that works! Let me check:\n\n35 divided by 7 is 5. Then 5 multiplied by 47 is 235. Then 235 minus 90 equals 145. So the equation would be (35 / 7) * 47 - 90 = 145.\n\nBut let me verify:\n\n35 ÷7=5\n\n5 ×47=235\n\n235 -90=145. Yes! That works. And all numbers are used once: 35,7,47,90. Each is used once, and all are used. So the equation is (35 / 7) * 47 - 90 =145.\n\nWait, but the order of operations? Let me check parentheses. If written as ((35 / 7) * 47) - 90, that would be correct. Alternatively, (35 / 7 *47) -90. But the multiplication and division are left to right. So 35/7 is 5, then 5*47=235, then 235-90=145. Yes. So the equation is correct.\n\nSo the equation is (35 / 7) * 47 - 90 =145. Let me just make sure all numbers are used once: 35,7,47,90. Yep. All used. Perfect.\n</think>\n\n<answer>((35 / 7) * 47) - 90 = 145</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using the numbers 16, 10, 16, and 60 exactly once each, and the result should be 600. The operations allowed are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Hmm.\n\nFirst, let me think about the target number, 600. What combinations could get close to that? Since 60 is one of the numbers, maybe multiplying it by something. 60 times 10 is 600, but I need to use all the numbers. Wait, if I do 60 * 10, that gives 600, but then I still have two 16s left. How can I incorporate them?\n\nAlternatively, maybe combining the two 16s first. If I add them, 16 + 16 = 32. Then 32 times something? Let's see, 32 times 18.75 is 600, but I don't have 18.75. But wait, 60 divided by something? If I do 32 * (60 / something) = 600. Let's see: 32 * (60/x) = 600 → 60/x = 600/32 → x = (60 *32)/600 = 3.2. Hmm, but I need to use the remaining numbers, which are 10 and maybe another. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use 60 * 10 = 600, but then how to use the two 16s. Maybe subtract or add them. But if I do 60*10 +16 -16, that's 600 +0 =600. But does that work? Using all numbers, but subtraction and addition. Let me check: 60 *10 +16 -16. That uses 60,10,16,16. Yes, each once. Wait, but 16 is used twice here. But the problem states that each number can only be used once. Wait, the original numbers are 16,10,16,60. So there are two 16s provided. So maybe the two 16s are considered separate even though they are the same value. So using both 16s is allowed since they are separate numbers. So in that case, 60 *10 +16 -16 would indeed use all four numbers once each. But the problem says \"each number can only be used once\", but since there are two 16s, perhaps they are considered separate instances. So the equation 60*10 +16 -16 would be valid. Let me check: 60*10 is 600, then +16-16 cancels out, so the total is 600. That works. But wait, the problem says \"you must use all the numbers\". So in that case, yes, both 16s are used. So that equation would be 60*10 +16 -16 =600. But maybe parentheses are needed for clarity. But maybe that's acceptable. Alternatively, maybe there's another way. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe combine the 16s in another operation. For example, 16 *16 =256. Then 256 + something. 256 + 344 =600. How to get 344 from 60 and 10. Hmm, 60*5.73 is about 344, but not exact. Alternatively, 60*10=600, so that's too big. Maybe 60*10 - (16*16). Let's see: 600 -256 =344. Not helpful. Wait, but that gives 344, not 600. Maybe (16*16) + (60*10) = 256 +600=856. Not helpful.\n\nAnother approach: 60 is a big number. Let's see 60*10 is 600. Then how to use the two 16s. If I can make them cancel each other. Like adding and subtracting. So 60*10 +16-16. Which is 600. But as before.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using division. 60*(10 +16 +16)/something. Wait, 10+16+16=42. 60*42=2520. If I divide that by 4.2, I get 600. But how to get 4.2 from the remaining numbers. Hmm, not possible.\n\nWait, what if I do (16 + 16) * (60 -10). Let's calculate that: 32 *50=1600. That's way over.\n\nAlternatively, 60*(16 +16) -10. 60*32=1920-10=1910. No. Not helpful.\n\nOr, 60*(16 -10) +16. 60*6=360 +16=376. Not 600.\n\nHmm. Let me think again. 60*10=600, and then using the two 16s as +16-16, which cancels. So the equation would be 60*10+16-16=600. That uses all four numbers once each, since the two 16s are separate. Is that allowed? The problem states that each number can be used once, but since there are two 16s provided, they are separate. So yes, that's acceptable. So that would work. Let me verify: 60 *10 is 600, then 600 +16 is 616, minus 16 is 600. So yes, correct.\n\nBut maybe the problem expects all numbers to be used in the equation, even if they cancel out. So this seems to fit. But perhaps there's another way. Let me check another possibility.\n\nWhat if I use division? For example, (60 * (16 +16)) /10. Let's calculate: 60*32=1920. 1920/10=192. Not 600.\n\nAlternatively, (60/10) * (16+16). 6 *32=192. Still not.\n\nAlternatively, 16*10 +16*60. 160 +960=1120. Nope.\n\nWait, 16*60=960. Then 960 + (10*16)= 960+160=1120. No.\n\nAlternatively, 16*16=256. 256 + 60 +10=326. No.\n\nHmm. Let's think again. The only way to get 600 directly is 60*10. So that's 600. Then the two 16s need to be used in a way that doesn't change the result. Adding and subtracting them is the simplest way. So 60*10 +16 -16 =600. Therefore, the equation would be 60*10+16-16=600. But maybe the problem expects that the numbers are used in an order where each is used once, but in this case, the two 16s are both used, which is allowed since they are separate numbers in the input. So that's acceptable. Alternatively, maybe using parentheses for clarity, like (60*10)+(16-16)=600. But since 16-16 is zero, that's the same as 60*10. But in that case, both 16s are used. So that would work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe another combination. Let me check. Suppose I do (16/16) *60*10. That would be 1*60*10=600. Yes, that's another way. Let me see: 16 divided by 16 is 1, then multiply by 60 and 10. So (16/16)*60*10=600. This uses all four numbers: 16, 16, 60, 10. Each once. Yes, that's a valid equation. That's better because all numbers are used in a multiplicative way, not just canceling each other. So that's (16/16) *60*10 =600. Let me check: 16/16=1, 1*60=60, 60*10=600. Correct. So this equation uses all numbers once, and the operations are division and multiplication. That seems more efficient and perhaps the intended answer.\n\nSo which one is better? The problem might prefer using all numbers in a way that they contribute to the result, rather than canceling out. So the (16/16)*60*10=600 is better. Because 16/16 is 1, then multiplied by 60 and 10 gives 600. So all numbers are used effectively. That's a better solution.\n\nSo the equation would be (16 / 16) * 60 * 10 = 600. Let me verify:\n\n16 divided by 16 is 1. Then 1 multiplied by 60 is 60. 60 multiplied by 10 is 600. Correct. Yes, this works and uses all numbers once. So this is a valid equation.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(16 / 16) * 60 * 10</answer>"}]}

Each number has to be used exactly once, and I can only use basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The result should be 69. Hmm, let me start by thinking about possible combinations.\n\nFirst, maybe I should look for pairs that can combine into numbers close to 69. Let's see. 63 is the largest number here. If I subtract something from 63, can I get close to 69? Wait, 63 is less than 69, so maybe adding to it. But 63 plus something... Let's check the other numbers. 24 and 27 are both in the 20s. 13 is a smaller number.\n\nIf I add 63 and 24, that's 87. That's way over. 63 + 27 is 90, which is even higher. 63 + 13 is 76. Still over 69. Maybe subtract something from that? For example, 63 + 24 - something. Let's say 63 + 24 = 87. Then 87 - 27 = 60. Not enough. Or 87 - 13 = 74. Still not 69.\n\nAlternatively, maybe multiply some numbers. Let's see. 24 and 27. If I multiply 24 and 27, that's a huge number, 648. Probably too big. 63 divided by something? 63 divided by 13 would be around 4.8, which isn't helpful. 27 divided by 13 is about 2.07. Maybe not.\n\nWhat if I consider 27 and 24 first. 27 + 24 = 51. Then 51 plus 13 is 64. That's 64, and then adding 63 would be way over. Not helpful. Alternatively, 27 - 24 = 3. Then 3 * 13 = 39, and 39 + 63 = 102. No.\n\nWait, maybe subtract. Let's think of 69 as a target. Let's see, 69 is 63 + 6. So if I can get 6 from the remaining numbers. The remaining numbers would be 24, 27, 13. How can I get 6 from those? Let's see. 24 divided by something. 24 divided by 4 is 6, but where do I get 4? 27 - 23? Wait, 27 minus (something) to get 4? Not sure. Or 27 minus 13 is 14. 24 divided by (27 - 13) is 24/14, which is about 1.714. Not 6. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, 27 - (24 / 13). That would be 27 - 1.846 ≈ 25.154. Not helpful. Maybe 24 - 13 = 11. Then 27 - 11 = 16. 63 + 16 = 79. Not 69.\n\nWait, maybe 63 - (something). If I subtract a certain value from 63 to get 69, but that's impossible because 63 is less than 69. So subtraction from 63 isn't the way. Then maybe addition to 63. Let's try 63 + (something) = 69. The something needs to be 6. How can I get 6 from 24, 27, 13. Let's see: 27 - 24 = 3, 3 * (13 - something). Wait, 27 - 24 = 3, then 3 * (13 - x). Hmm. Maybe not. Alternatively, 24 / (27 - 13) = 24 /14 ≈1.714. Not 6.\n\nAlternatively, 27 - (24 +13) = 27 -37 = -10. Then 63 - (-10) =73. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe multiplication and division. Let's think of combining numbers in a way that when multiplied or divided, they can help reach the target. For example, 27 divided by something. 27/13 is about 2.07. Then 24 * 2.07 ≈ 49.68. 63 - 49.68 ≈13.32. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 24 divided by 13 is about 1.846. Then 27 * 1.846 ≈50. Then 63 -50=13. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe (27 + 24) = 51. Then 51 +13=64. 64 +5=69. But where's the 5? Maybe (63 - (27 +24)) = 63 -51=12. Then 12 +13=25. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 63 - 27 =36. Then 36 +24=60. 60 +13=73. Not 69.\n\nWhat if 63 -24=39. Then 39 +27=66. 66 +13=79. No.\n\nWait, maybe 63 - (27 -24) =63 -3=60. Then 60 +13=73. Still not.\n\nHmm. Maybe some multiplication. Let's try 13 * something. 13 *5=65. 65 +4=69. How to get 5 and 4? Not sure. Alternatively, 13 * 3=39. Then 39 +30=69. Where to get 30? 63 -24=39. Wait, that's 39 again. Hmm.\n\nWait, let's try different combinations. Let's see: 27 and 13. 27 -13=14. Then 24 +14=38. 63 -38=25. No.\n\nAlternatively, 24 * (27 -13) =24*14=336. Then 336 divided by 63=5.333. Not helpful.\n\nWait, 24 divided by 13 is approximately 1.846. 27 times that is about 50. Then 63 -50=13. But we already used 13. So that's not allowed.\n\nAlternatively, 63 divided by 27 is approximately 2.333. Multiply by 24: 2.333*24≈56. Then 56 +13=69. Wait, that's interesting. Let me check: (63 /27)*24 +13.\n\nBut wait, 63 divided by 27 is 2.333..., multiplied by24: 2.333...*24=56. Then 56+13=69. That works. Let me verify the numbers used: 63,27,24,13. All used once. So the equation is (63 /27)*24 +13=69. Let's compute step by step:\n\n63 divided by27=2.333...\n\nMultiply by24: 2.333... *24=56\n\n56 +13=69. Yes! That works. So the equation would be ((63 / 27) * 24) +13 =69. \n\nAlternatively, written without parentheses (following order of operations): 63 /27*24 +13. Since division and multiplication have the same precedence, it's left to right. So 63 divided by27 is 2.333..., multiplied by24 is56, plus13 is69. So that works.\n\nSo the equation is (63 / 27) * 24 +13 =69. But let me check if all numbers are used exactly once: 63,27,24,13. Yes, all used once. So that's the solution.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(63 / 27) * 24 + 13 = 69</answer>"}]}

Hmm, 396 is a pretty big number, so maybe multiplication is involved here. Let me think about how to combine these numbers.\n\nFirst, let's look at the target number: 396. Let's see if any of the given numbers can multiply to get close to that. 66 is a big number. If I multiply 66 by something... 66 multiplied by 6 is 396. Wait, 66 * 6 = 396. But do I have a 6?

Then how to get to 396 from there? 132 *3=396. But that uses 66, 38, 19, and 3. So that would be (66 * (38 / 19)) * 3. Let me check that.\n\nFirst, 38 divided by 19 is 2. Then 66 * 2 = 132. Then 132 *3=396. Yes! That uses all the numbers: 66, 38, 19, 3. Each used once, and the operations are division, multiplication, and another multiplication. So the equation would be (66 * (38 / 19)) * 3 = 396.\n\nWait, but do I need parentheses here? Let me verify the order of operations. If it's written as 66 * 38 / 19 *3, according to left associativity, that would be ((66 *38)/19)*3. Let's calculate that. 66*38=2508. 2508/19=132. 132*3=396. So yes, even without parentheses, that works. But maybe the user expects explicit parentheses to clarify. So maybe writing it as (66 * 38 / 19) * 3. Or 66 * (38 / 19) *3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using subtraction or addition. Let me see if there's another way. For example, 66*6=396. How to get 6 from 38, 19, 3. 38 - (19*3) = 38 -57= -19. Not helpful. 38 +19=57. 57/3=19. Hmm. Then 66* (57/3) would be 66*19=1254. Not 396. Alternatively, 38 + (19 -3)=54. 54* something. 54*7.333... not helpful.\n\nAnother approach: maybe 3*38=114. 114* something. 114*3.47... Hmm. Not helpful. 19*3=57. 66+57=123. 123* something? 123*3.219... Not helpful. Maybe 66*3=198. Then 198*2=396. How to get 2 from 38 and 19. 38/19=2. So again, same as before. So 66*3=198, then 198*(38/19)=198*2=396. So that would be (66*3)*(38/19)= 198*2=396. That's another valid equation. So here, using 66*3 first, then multiply by (38/19). So the equation would be (66 *3) * (38 /19) = 396. But that's similar to the first approach. Either way, the same numbers and operations are used. The order of multiplication doesn't matter because multiplication is commutative.\n\nSo both equations work. Which one is more straightforward? Well, perhaps the first one. Let me check again. The first way: 66*(38/19)*3. 38/19 is 2, so 66*2=132, then *3=396. The other way: (66*3)*(38/19) is 198*2=396. Either way works. So both equations are correct. But the problem allows any arrangement as long as all numbers are used once with basic operations. So either of those would be acceptable. Let me make sure there are no other combinations.\n\nAnother possibility: 19*3=57. Then 66 +57=123. Then 123 * something. 123 *3.219… but that's not 396. 38 is left. 123*38=4674, which is way over. So that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 66 -3=63. 63 * something. 63 * (38 -19)=63*19=1197. Not 396. 38-19=19. 63*19=1197. Nope. Not helpful.\n\nAnother approach: 66 divided by 3=22. Then 22* something. 22*18=396. How to get 18 from 38 and 19. 38 -19=19. 19- (something?) No. 38/19=2. 2+16=18, but how to get 16 from remaining numbers. Wait, but we've already used 66, 3, 38, 19. No, here we have 66 divided by 3, which uses 66 and 3. Then we need to use 38 and 19. So 38 and 19. If I do (38 -19) that's 19. Then 22 *19=418. Not 396. Alternatively, 38/19=2. Then 22*2=44. 44* something. But 44*9=396. How to get 9 from... but already used all numbers. So this path doesn't work.\n\nSo the only viable options are the ones involving multiplying 66 and 3 with (38/19). So the equation would be either (66 * (38 / 19)) *3 or (66 *3) * (38 /19). Alternatively, written without parentheses as 66 * 38 /19 *3, which, due to order of operations (left to right for multiplication/division), would give the same result.\n\nSo the answer could be written in different forms. Let me pick one. Let's go with (66 * 38 / 19) * 3. Or maybe 66 * (38 / 19) *3. Both are correct. Let me check if the parentheses are necessary. If written as 66 * 38 / 19 *3, the order would be (((66 *38)/19)*3). Let's compute that step by step.\n\n66*38=2508. 2508 divided by 19: 2508 /19. Let's compute that. 19*132=2508. Yes, so 2508/19=132. Then 132*3=396. So yes, that works. So even without parentheses, it's correct. But maybe the problem expects explicit parentheses. But per the example given, like (1+2)/3, maybe they want parentheses to make the equation clear. So perhaps (66 * (38 / 19)) *3. Let me confirm that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another combination. Let's think again. Suppose we use subtraction. For example, 38 -19=19. Then 3*19=57. Then 66*57=3762. Not helpful. Alternatively, 66 -38=28. 28*19=532. 532*3=1596. No. Not close.\n\nAnother approach: 66 +38=104. 104*3=312. 312+19=331. Not 396. 312*19 is way too big. Nope.\n\nAlternatively, 19*3=57. 66*57=3762. Then 3762 -38=3724. No. Not helpful.\n\nHmm. I think the only viable way is through multiplying 66 by 3 and 38/19. So the equation is (66 *3) * (38 /19)= 198*2=396. So the equation would be (66 * 3) * (38 / 19) = 396. Or written as (66 × 3 × 38) ÷ 19. Since multiplication and division are left associative, but in this case, the grouping doesn't matter. Alternatively, 66 × 3 × (38 ÷ 19). All are correct.\n\nSo I think this is the correct equation. Let me just verify once more. 38 divided by 19 is 2. 66 multiplied by 3 is 198. 198 multiplied by 2 is 396. Yes, that works. All numbers are used once: 66,38,19,3. Operations used: division, multiplication, multiplication. Perfect.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(66 * 3) * (38 / 19) = 396</answer>"}]}

Each number has to be used exactly once, and the result should be 347. The operations allowed are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Hmm, let's start by thinking about how these numbers can combine to get close to 347.\n\nFirst, 347 is a bit over 300. The largest number I have here is 100. If I can multiply 100 by something to get close. Let's see, 100 * 3 is 300. Then maybe add the 57 and 13. But 300 + 57 +13 would be 370, which is too much. That's 23 over. So that might not work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use division or subtraction to adjust it. Let me check 100*3 =300. Then 57 +13 is 70. So 300 +70=370. Still too high. Hmm. Maybe subtract something instead. 100*3 is 300. Then subtract (57 -13). Wait, 57-13 is 44. So 300 -44 =256. That's way too low. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe combine the numbers in a different way. What if I use 57 and 3 first. 57*3 is 171. Then add 100. That's 271. Then add 13 to get 284. Still not enough. Not close to 347.\n\nAlternatively, 57*100 is 5700. That's way too big. Maybe divide that by something. 5700 divided by 13 is like 438.46... Not helpful. Divided by 3 would be 1900. Also way too big. Maybe subtract that from something else? Not sure.\n\nAnother approach: Let's see, 347 is 340 +7. How can I get 340? 100*3 is 300, plus 57 is 357, minus 17. But 17 isn't here. Alternatively, 100*3 + 57 =357. Then subtract 10. But 10 isn't available. Wait, maybe 13 -3 is 10. Then 357 -10=347. Let's check:\n\n100*3 +57 - (13 -3) = 300 +57 -10 = 347. Oh! That works. Let me verify: 100*3 is 300, then 300 +57 is 357. Then subtract (13-3) which is 10. 357-10=347. Perfect! And all numbers are used once: 100, 3, 57, 13, and 3. Wait, no, the 3 is used in 100*3 and again in (13-3). Wait, but we can only use each number once. Oh, right! The original numbers are 57, 100, 13, and 3. So in this case, the 3 is used twice here. Once as the multiplier in 100*3 and again in the subtraction (13-3). That's a problem because we can only use each number once. So that equation would be invalid because we used 3 twice. Oops.\n\nSo that approach doesn't work. Need to find another way. Let's think again.\n\nWhat if we do 100 + 57 = 157. Then multiply by 3? 157*3=471. Then subtract 13: 471-13=458. Still too high. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, 100 -13 =87. Then 87 *3=261. Then add 57 + something? Wait, 261 +57=318. Then we need 29 more. But we already used 100,13,3,57. Wait, 318 is still low. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe 57 * (13 -3) =57*10=570. Then subtract 100. 570-100=470. Still too high. Then subtract something else? Wait, but we used all numbers except 100? No, 57*(13-3) uses 57,13,3. Then subtract 100. That uses all numbers. 570-100=470, which is not 347. So that's 470. Still off.\n\nAlternatively, 57*3=171. Then 171 +100=271. Then 271 +13=284. Still low.\n\nWhat if we divide some numbers. Let's see, 100 divided by something. 100 /3 ≈33.333. Then 57 +33.333=90.333. Then multiply by 13? That would be 1174.333. No, way too high.\n\nAlternatively, 13*3=39. 57 +39=96. Then 96*3=288. Wait, but we already used 13,3,57. Then add 100. 288+100=388. Still too high.\n\nHmm. Maybe combine multiplication and addition. Let's see, 100 +57=157. 157 * something. If we can get 157 multiplied by a number close to 2.2. But we don't have 2.2. Maybe 13 divided by 3 is approximately 4.333. Not helpful. Or 3 divided by 13. 0.2307. 157*0.2307≈36.3. Then 36.3 + something. Not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps using subtraction. Let's think of 347 as 57*6 + something. 57*6=342, which is close. Then 342 +5=347. But where do we get 6 and 5? Alternatively, 57* (something) + something else. Let's see, 57*5=285. 285 +62=347. But 62 can be 100 - something. 100 -38=62. But 38 is 13*3 -1? Not sure. Maybe not.\n\nWait, 57*6=342. 6 can be 13- (something). 13 - (3 + something). Wait, 13- (3 + something)=6, so something=13-3-6=4. But we don't have 4. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 57*(3) + (100 -13) = 171 +87=258. No, that's 258. Not 347.\n\nHmm. Let's try 100*3 + (57 -13). 300 +44=344. Close to 347. Only 3 less. But how to get that 3? Wait, maybe we can use the 3 again, but we can't. We already used 3 in 100*3. So that's not allowed.\n\nAlternatively, 100*3 +57 -13. That would be 300 +57=357, minus 13=344. Again, same as before. Still 3 short.\n\nWait, if we can use the 3 again, but we can't. So perhaps that approach isn't working.\n\nAnother angle: Let's think about 13*27=351. 351 is 4 over 347. Hmm, 27 can be made from 3*9, but we don't have 9. Alternatively, 100 -57=43. 43-13=30. 30* something. 30*11=330. No.\n\nWait, 100 - (3*13)=100-39=61. Then 61*5.7. But 5.7 is 57/10. But we can only use each number once. So 61* (57/10) would use 57, but 10 isn't a number here. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 57 + 13=70. 70*5=350. 5 can be (100 /20). But 20 isn't available. Hmm. 100 divided by something. 100 /3 ≈33. So 70 +33=103. Then 103*3=309. Not helpful.\n\nWait, 57* (100 -13) divided by 3. Let's compute that. 100-13=87. 57*87=4959. Divided by 3 is 1653. Way too big.\n\nHmm. Maybe 100 + (57* (13 -3)). Let's see: 13-3=10. 57*10=570. 100+570=670. That's way over.\n\nAlternatively, 100* (13 -3) -57. 100*10=1000. 1000-57=943. Still too high.\n\nWait, maybe use division to reduce some numbers. For example, 57 divided by 3 is 19. Then 19*100=1900. Then subtract 13. 1900-13=1887. Way too high.\n\nAlternatively, 13 divided by 3 is around 4.333. 57*4.333≈247. Then 247 +100=347. Wait, that's exactly 347! Let me check: 57*(13/3) +100. Let's compute that. 13 divided by 3 is approximately 4.333..., so 57 times that is 57*(4 + 1/3) =57*4 +57*(1/3)=228 +19=247. Then 247 +100=347. That works! But wait, are we allowed to use division in that way? The problem states that we can use each number once. So 13/3 uses 13 and 3, which are separate numbers. So the equation would be 57*(13/3) +100. Let's check if we use each number once: 57, 13, 3, 100. Yes, all four numbers are used exactly once. The operations are division (13/3), multiplication (57 times that result), and addition (adding 100). So this should be valid.\n\nSo the equation is 57*(13/3) +100 =347. Let's verify:\n\n13 divided by 3 is approximately 4.3333.\n\n57 multiplied by 4.3333 is 57 *4 =228, plus 57*0.3333 ≈19, so total ≈247.\n\n247 +100 =347. Exactly. So that works.\n\nSo the equation is (57 * (13 / 3)) + 100 =347. And all numbers are used once: 57,13,3,100. Perfect.\n</think>\n\n<answer>57 * (13 / 3) + 100 = 347</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using all the numbers 136, 62, 95, and 17, each exactly once, with basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) to get 698. Hmm. Let's start by thinking about the target number. 698 is a bit less than 700. So maybe I can find combinations that get close to that. Let's list out the numbers and think about possible operations.\n\nFirst, 136 is the largest number here. Maybe I can use multiplication to get a larger number. If I multiply 136 by something. Let's see, 136 times 5 is 680, which is close to 698. But 5 isn't one of the numbers. Wait, maybe using 136 and another number multiplied. Let's check the other numbers: 62, 95, 17. If I multiply 136 by 5, but where would 5 come from? Alternatively, maybe subtract something from a larger product.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 136 + something. Let's see 136 + 62 is 198, which is way too low. 136 + 95 is 231, still not close. 136 + 17 is 153. Hmm. Not helpful. \n\nWhat about multiplication between other numbers. Let's see, 62 and 17. 62*17 is 1054. Then maybe subtract or add the other numbers. 1054 - 136 is 918, then subtract 95? 918-95=823. Not 698. Maybe that's not the way. \n\nAlternatively, 95*17=1615. Then subtract 136*62? Wait, 136*62 is 8432. That's way too big. Maybe that's not helpful. \n\nWait, let's think of division. Maybe dividing a larger number by something to get a useful intermediate. For example, 95 divided by 17 is about 5.588. If I multiply that by 136, 136*5.588 is around 759, which is higher than 698. Hmm, but maybe with some combination. Let me calculate exactly: 95 ÷ 17 = 5. Then 5. So 5 * 136 = 680. Then 680 + 62 - 17? Wait, but I already used 17 in the division. Oh, wait, but we have to use each number exactly once. So if I use 95 and 17 in a division, then I can't use them again. So 95/17 = 5. Then 136 * 5 = 680. Then I have 62 left. So 680 + 62 = 742. Which is 44 over. Not 698. Alternatively, 680 + (62 - something), but I don't have any other numbers left. So maybe that approach isn't working.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 136 * 5.588 (from 95/17) is 759, then subtract 62? 759 -62=697. Close to 698, but off by 1. Hmm. Maybe not precise enough.\n\nWait, perhaps a different combination. Let's see, 62 * 17 is 1054. Then 1054 - 136 = 918. Then 918 - 95 = 823. No, same as before. Not helpful.\n\nWait, what if we do 136 * 5 (from 95 - 62 -17)? Wait, but that would require using numbers in a different way. Wait, but each number must be used once. So maybe 136 * (95 - (62 +17)). Let's compute that: 62 +17=79. 95-79=16. Then 136 *16 = 2176. That's way too big. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 136 + 62 = 198. Then 198 * something. Let's see 198 * 3.5 = 693. Close to 698. But where would 3.5 come from? 17 and 95. Maybe 95 / 17 =5.588. Not 3.5. Hmm.\n\nWait, 95 divided by 17 is approximately 5.588. Then 136 + 62 =198. Then 198 * (95/17) = 198*5.588≈198*5.588≈1107. That's over, but maybe subtract something? But all numbers are used. Wait, 136 is already used. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 136 * 62 = 8432. That's way too big. Then divide by something. Let's see 8432 / 95 ≈88.757. Then subtract 17: 88.757 -17≈71.757. Not 698.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 136*(62 - (95/17)). Let's compute 95/17=5.588. 62-5.588≈56.412. Then 136*56.412≈7684. Way too big.\n\nHmm. Maybe using subtraction. Let's think of 698 as 700 - 2. How to get 700. 700 could be 7*100. But not sure. Alternatively, 136*5 + 62 - something. Wait, 136*5=680, 680+62=742, then 742-44=698. Where does 44 come from? 95 and 17. 95-17=78. Not 44. Hmm.\n\nWait, 95 -17=78. 78 is a number. But how to get 44. Alternatively, 95 /17=5.588. Not helpful. Maybe 95 - (17* something). 17*2=34. 95-34=61. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 62 - (95/17) =62-5.588≈56.412. Then multiply by 136? No, that's too big.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's consider that 698 divided by 136 is approximately 5.132. So if I can get a multiplier close to 5.132 using the other numbers. The numbers left are 62, 95,17. How?\n\nMaybe 95 - (62 -17). Let's see: 62-17=45. 95-45=50. Then 136*50=6800. Not helpful. Alternatively, 95 -62=33, then 33 +17=50. Same result.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, 62 +17=79. 95 -79=16. Then 136*16=2176. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 95*17=1615. Then 1615 -136=1479. Then 1479 -62=1417. Not close.\n\nWait, maybe (136 + 95) * something. 136+95=231. 231*3=693, which is 5 less than 698. Where can 3 come from? 62 and 17. 62/17≈3.647. So 231*(62/17)=231*3.647≈842. Then 842 - something? But all numbers are used. Hmm.\n\nWait, 231*(62/17) ≈231*3.647≈842. Then subtract nothing. But that's way over. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 136 - 95=41. Then 41*17=697. Then 697 +62=759. No. Not 698. Alternatively, 41*17=697, then 697 + (62 - something). Wait, but used numbers would be 136,95,17. The remaining is 62. So 697 +62=759. No.\n\nWait, 697 is just 1 less than 698. Maybe if there's a way to get 697 and then add 1. But how? Since all numbers must be used. Hmm. But maybe we can adjust the operations.\n\nWait, let's try to get 697 first. As I saw, (136 -95) *17=41*17=697. Then, adding 62 would overshoot. But 697 +1=698. But where can the 1 come from? Maybe 62/62=1, but 62 is already used. Wait, but if we can use 62 in another way. Wait, perhaps reorganize the operations. Let me check again.\n\nWait, (136 -95)=41. Then 41*17=697. Then we have 62 left. So 697 +62=759. Not helpful. Alternatively, 697 + (62/62)=698, but that would require using 62 twice. Not allowed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (136 - (95/17)) * something. Let's compute 95/17≈5.588. 136 -5.588≈130.412. Then multiply by, say, 5.588. But 130*5.588≈727. Then 727 - something? Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 136*(62 -17) -95. Let's compute 62-17=45. 136*45=6120. 6120-95=6025. No. That's way off.\n\nWait, maybe 136 + (62*95)/17. Let's compute 62*95=5890. Then 5890/17≈346.47. Then 136 +346.47≈482.47. Not close.\n\nAlternatively, 136*62 - (95 +17). 136*62=8432. 95+17=112. 8432 -112=8320. Nope.\n\nHmm. Maybe using division in a smart way. Let's see, 95 divided by 17 is about 5.588. So if we can use that as a multiplier. For example, 5.588*136=759. Then subtract 62? 759-62=697. Close to 698. Just 1 off. But how to adjust that? Maybe if the division was exact. Let's check: 95 divided by 17 is exactly 5.588235294117647. So 136 * (95/17) = 136*5.588235294117647 ≈ 760. So 760 -62=698. Wait, that's exactly 698? Let me check the exact calculation.\n\nCalculating 95 divided by 17: 17*5=85, 95-85=10. So 95/17=5 +10/17. Then 136*(5 +10/17)=136*5 +136*(10/17)=680 + (1360/17)=680 +80=760. Oh! Because 1360 divided by 17 is 80, since 17*80=1360. So 136*(95/17)=760. Then 760 -62=698. Wait, that works! Let me verify:\n\n136 multiplied by (95 divided by 17) equals 136*(95/17). Since 95 divided by 17 is 5.588..., but when you compute 136*95=12920, then divided by 17: 12920 ÷17=760. Then subtract 62: 760-62=698. Exactly! So the equation would be (136 * (95 / 17)) - 62 = 698. Let me check if all numbers are used once: 136, 95, 17, and 62. Yes. All used. Operations are division, multiplication, and subtraction. So that's the equation.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(136 * (95 / 17)) - 62 = 698</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using the numbers 59, 5, 61, and 75 exactly once each, and combine them with basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) to get 856. Hmm, this might take some trial and error.\n\nFirst, I should think about the target number, 856. Let me see if I can break this down into parts. Maybe multiplying some of the larger numbers together and then adjusting with the smaller ones. Let's look at the numbers given: 59, 5, 61, 75. The largest numbers here are 75 and 61, followed by 59 and then 5. Let me try multiplying 75 and 61 first. 75 times 61 is 4575. That's way too big. But maybe subtract something from that? If I subtract 59, that's 4575 - 59 = 4516. Still way too high. What if I subtract 5? 4575 -5 =4570. Not helpful. Maybe division is needed here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe multiplying 75 by 5. 75*5 is 375. Then, perhaps adding 61? 375 +61=436. That's 436, which is still too low. Then maybe multiply by 59? But 436*59 is way over 856. Wait, but we can only use each number once. So if I use 75*5, that's using 75 and 5, then add 61, that's 61 used. Then the remaining number is 59. So how do I incorporate 59? Hmm. Maybe 75*(5 + something) involving 59 and 61. Let's see.\n\nWait, maybe 61 and 5. 61*5 is 305. Then add 75: 305 +75=380. Then multiply by 59? No, 380*59 is 22,420. That's way too big. Maybe subtract 59 instead. 380 -59=321. Still not close. Maybe a different approach.\n\nWhat if I try combining 59 and 61 first. 59 +61=120. Then 120 multiplied by something. 120*7=840, which is close to 856. But where do I get 7? If I use 75 and 5, maybe 75 -5=70. Wait, 70 divided by 10? Hmm, but I don't have a 10. Alternatively, 75 divided by 5 is 15. Then 15 + something. Wait, 120*15=1800, which is way over. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 75 - (something). Let's see. 75* (61 - 59) = 75*2=150. Then 150*5=750. Still not enough. 750 is less than 856. Then maybe add 61? But we already used 61. Wait, no. Let me check: 75*(61 - 59) = 75*2=150, then multiply by 5: 150*5=750. Then we still have 61 and 59 used as part of the operation. Wait, no, the problem says each number can be used once. So in this case, 61 and 59 are used in the subtraction, so they can't be used again. So 750 is all we get, but we need to reach 856. That's 106 more. But we have no numbers left because 75, 61, 59, 5 are all used. So that doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 61*5=305. Then 305 + 75=380. Then 380 +59=439. Not close. Alternatively, 61*5=305. Then 305*2=610. But how to get 2? Maybe 75 divided by something. 75/5=15. Wait, but 5 is already used. Not allowed. Hmm.\n\nWait, another idea: 75 multiplied by 11 gives 825. Then adding 31 gets to 856. How to get 11 and 31 from the remaining numbers? Let's see. 5, 59, 61. Maybe 61 - 5=56. That's not 31. 59-5=54. No. Alternatively, 61 - (59/5). But division might complicate things. Let's calculate that: 59 divided by 5 is 11.8. Then 61 -11.8=49.2. Not helpful. Alternatively, maybe 61 - (59 -5)=61-54=7. Then 75*7=525. Then 525 + 5=530. Not close. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to have a multiplication and then addition or subtraction. Let's think about 856. Let me factor 856. 856 divided by 8 is 107. So 8*107=856. So if I can get 8 and 107. How to get 107? 107 is 75 +32. But 32 from where? 5 and 59? 59 - (5* something). 5*6=30, 59-30=29. Not 32. Alternatively, 59 +5=64. 64 is 8*8. So maybe 75 + (59 +5) =75+64=139. Not 107. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 856 divided by 59. 856 /59 is approximately 14.508. Not a whole number. 856 divided by 61 is approximately 14.03. Again not a whole number. 856 divided by 5 is 171.2. 856 divided by 75 is about 11.413. So division of 856 by any of the numbers doesn't give an integer. So perhaps a combination of multiplication and addition.\n\nWait, let's try 61*14=854. That's close to 856. Then 854 +2=856. How to get 14 and 2? Let's see. The remaining numbers are 59,5,75. Hmm. 14 could be 5 +9, but where do we get 9? 59-50? Not helpful. Alternatively, 75 -61=14. But 61 is already used. Alternatively, 5 + (59/ something). 59 divided by something to get 9. Maybe 59 divided by 6, but we don't have a 6. Alternatively, 75 divided by 5=15. Then 15-1=14. Where do we get 1? 61-60? But no. 61-59=2. Maybe 75/5=15, then 15 - (61-59)=15-2=13. Then 61*13=793. Then 793 + (remaining numbers: 5 and 59? But already used 61, 75,5,59. So no numbers left. Hmm. Not helpful.\n\nWait another angle: Let's try 75*11=825. 856-825=31. So we need 31 from the remaining numbers 5,59,61. How? 61 - (59 -5)=61 -54=7. Not 31. Alternatively, 59 - (61 -5)=59-56=3. No. 61-5=56. Then 56-59=-3. Not helpful. Maybe 59 -5=54. 54 and 61. 61 -54=7. Still no. \n\nAlternatively, 59 +5=64. 61 - something. 64-61=3. Still not 31. Hmm. Maybe this approach isn't working.\n\nLet's think differently. Maybe using division to get a larger number. For example, 75 divided by 5=15. Then multiply by 59: 15*59=885. Then subtract 61: 885-61=824. Close to 856 but still 32 off. 824 +32=856. Where to get 32? But we already used all numbers: 75,5,59,61. So that's not possible. Alternatively, 75/5=15; 15*61=915. Then subtract 59: 915-59=856. Wait, let me check that. 75 divided by 5 is 15. 15 multiplied by 61 is 15*61=915. Then subtract 59: 915-59=856. Yes! That works. Let me verify the numbers: 75,5,61,59. Each used once. The operations are /, *, -. So the equation would be (75 / 5) * 61 - 59 = 856.\n\nLet me compute step by step to confirm:\n\n75 divided by 5 is 15.\n\n15 multiplied by 61: 15 *61 = 915.\n\n915 minus 59: 915-59=856. Exactly.\n\nSo that's the equation: (75 / 5) * 61 - 59 = 856.\n</think>\n\n<answer>((75 / 5) * 61) - 59 = 856</answer>"}]}

Let me think how to approach this.\n\nFirst, 778 is a pretty large number, so I probably need to use multiplication to get there. Let me check the largest numbers first. The biggest numbers here are 70 and 43. Multiplying those two: 70 * 43 = 3010. Hmm, that's way too big. But maybe if I subtract something from that product. Wait, 3010 minus the remaining numbers. The remaining numbers are 12 and 16. So 3010 - (12 + 16) = 3010 - 28 = 2982. Still way off. So that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can combine them differently. Let's see, 70 and 43 are the big ones. What if I subtract them first? 70 - 43 = 27. That's not helpful. Maybe add them: 70 + 43 = 113. Then multiply by something. Let's see, 113 * 12 = 1356. Then subtract 16? 1356 -16 = 1340. Still not 778. Hmm.\n\nWhat if I use division to bring down some numbers? Like 70 divided by something. For example, 70 / 12 is about 5.83. Then multiply by 43: 5.83 *43 ≈ 250.69. Then add 16: ≈ 266.69. Not close. Maybe 70/(16-12) = 70/4 =17.5. Then 17.5 *43= 752.5. Then add 12? 752.5 +12= 764.5. Close to 778 but not exactly. Hmm. Wait, 752.5 is close. If I can get another 25.5, but how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe 43 * 16 = 688. Then adding 70 gives 758, then adding 12 is 770. Still 8 short. Not enough.\n\nWait, 43 * (70 - something). Let's see. 70 -12=58. Then 43*58= 43*(50+8)=2150 + 344=2494. Then subtract 16? 2494-16=2478. No. That's not helpful.\n\nWhat if I do 70 * (12 + 16). Let's compute that. 12+16=28. 70*28=1960. Then subtract 43? 1960-43=1917. Nope. Doesn't help.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe use 43 multiplied by some combination. Let's see. 70 - (16 / 12). Wait, 16/12 is 1.333... Then 70 -1.333=68.666, multiply by 43: 43*68.666... Hmm, that's around 2952.666. Then subtract nothing? Doesn't help.\n\nWait, maybe division with the smaller numbers. For instance, 12 and 16. If I do 16 - 12 =4. Then 70 divided by 4 is 17.5. Multiply by 43: 17.5*43=752.5. Then add... Wait, we already used 70, 43, 12, 16. So that's all numbers. So 752.5 is the result. But we need 778. So that's 25.5 short. But we can't use numbers again. Hmm. Maybe that approach isn't working.\n\nWait, maybe use subtraction somewhere else. Let's try 70*12=840. Then subtract something. The remaining numbers are 43 and 16. 840 -43=797, then subtract 16 is 781. Close to 778, but still 3 off. Hmm. 797-16=781. Wait, 781 vs 778. Not quite. Maybe rearrange the operations. 70*12=840. Then subtract (43 +16)=59. So 840 -59=781. Same as before. Not helpful.\n\nWhat if we do 70*(43 -16). Let's see. 43-16=27. 70*27=1890. Then subtract 12? 1890-12=1878. Still way too high.\n\nWait, perhaps 43*(70 - (16 -12)). Let's compute inside the parentheses first:16-12=4. Then 70-4=66. 43*66=2838. Then subtract nothing. But we need to use all numbers. Wait, we used 43,70,16,12. So that's all. 2838. Not 778. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, 43 +70=113. 113*12=1356. 1356-16=1340. Still not.\n\nWhat if I divide 70 by 12 first? 70/12 is approximately 5.8333. Then multiply by 43: 5.8333*43≈251.333. Then add 16: 267.333. No.\n\nAlternatively, 70 - (43* something). Let's say 43*12=516. Then 70 -516= -446. Then add 16: -430. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe reverse. 43*(something). Let's see. If I can get (70 + 12 +16)=98. Then 43*98=4214. That's way too big. But we need to use each number once. So maybe not.\n\nWait, perhaps using subtraction and multiplication. Let's try: (70 - 43) =27. Then 27 * (16 +12)=27*28=756. Then add 70? Wait, no, 70 was already used. Oh right, we can only use each number once. So (70-43)=27, then multiply by (16 +12)=28. So 27*28=756. Then we have used 70,43,16,12. All of them. 756. But we need 778. 756 is 22 less. Hmm. So that's not enough.\n\nWait, 756 is close. Maybe if there's a way to adjust operations. But how? Since all numbers are used. Maybe rearrange the operations.\n\nWait, what if instead of (70 -43) * (16 +12), perhaps (70 +43) * (16 -12). Let's see. 70+43=113. 16-12=4. Then 113*4=452. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, (70 * 16) - (43 *12). Let's compute that. 70*16=1120. 43*12=516. 1120 -516=604. Then subtract or add the remaining numbers? Wait, we already used 70,16,43,12. So all numbers are used. 604 is not 778.\n\nAlternatively, (70 * 12) + (43 *16). 70*12=840. 43*16=688. 840 +688=1528. That's way over.\n\nHmm, maybe using division to increase a number. Like 70 divided by (something) to make it bigger. Wait, division usually makes numbers smaller unless dividing by a fraction. But how?\n\nWait, maybe 43 * (70 + (16 /12)). Let's see. 16/12 is 1.333. 70 +1.333≈71.333. 43*71.333≈3072.333. No, that's way too big.\n\nAlternatively, (70 +43) * (16 -12) =113*4=452. Still not.\n\nWait, let's think about 778. What's 778 divided by 43? Let me check: 43*18=774, so 43*18 +4=778. So 43*18 +4=778. Can we make 18 and 4 from the remaining numbers? The remaining numbers after using 43 are 70,12,16. So 70,12,16. We need to make 18 and 4. Let's see: 70 - (12+16)=70-28=42. Not helpful. 70 -16=54. 54/12=4.5. Hmm. Or 16 -12=4. Then 70/ (16-12)=70/4=17.5. Then 17.5 *43=752.5. Then add 4.5? Wait, but we can't use the numbers again. Wait, 16-12 gives us 4, then we have 70 left. So 70 /4=17.5. Then 17.5*43=752.5. Then add the remaining number? But we already used all numbers:43,70,12,16. So there's no remaining number. So that gives 752.5. Not 778. Close, but not there.\n\nAlternatively, if we can get 43*(something) + (something else). Let's see, 43*18=774. Then 774 +4=778. As before. So 18 and 4. How to get 18 and 4 from 70,12,16.\n\nWait, 70 - (16 +12 +43) but no, we need to use each once. Wait, 70 - (12 +16) =70-28=42. Then 42 - (something). Wait, not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 12 +16=28. Then 70 -28=42. Then 42* something. But 42*43=1806. Then 1806- (something). But again, numbers are already used.\n\nWait, perhaps 70 -12=58. Then 58*16=928. Then subtract 43* something. Wait, 928 -43* something. But 928 -43*X=778. So 43X=928-778=150. X=150/43≈3.488. Not an integer. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 70*16=1120. 1120 - (43*12)=1120-516=604. Still not.\n\nWait, maybe 70*12=840. Then 840 -43=797. Then 797 -16=781. Still not 778.\n\nHmm. Maybe using division in a different way. Let's try 70 divided by something. Suppose 70/(16-12)=70/4=17.5. Then 17.5*43=752.5. Then add 12? Wait, already used 12. Wait, no, in this case, we used 70, 16, 12, 43. So all numbers are used. 752.5. Not 778.\n\nWait, 752.5 is 778 -752.5=25.5 short. How can we get that? Maybe rearrange operations. Let's think differently.\n\nWhat if we do (43 +16) * 12. 59*12=708. Then add 70: 708+70=778. Oh! Wait, 43+16=59. 59*12=708. 708+70=778. But are we allowed to use + multiple times? Yes, the problem says we can use operations multiple times. Let's check the numbers: 43,16,12,70. Each used once. Yes. So (43 +16) *12 +70 =59*12=708 +70=778. That works!\n\nLet me verify:\n\nFirst, 43 +16 =59.\n\nThen 59 *12=708.\n\nThen 708 +70=778.\n\nYes, exactly. All numbers used once, operations are +, *, +. So the equation is (43 +16) *12 +70 =778.\n\nSo the answer should be <answer>(43 + 16) * 12 + 70</answer>.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(43 + 16) * 12 + 70</answer>"}]}

Maybe 60 - (15 +3)=60-18=42. Not 17. Alternatively, 60/3=20, then 20 -15=5. Still not. So maybe this approach isn't working.\n\nAlternatively, maybe adding 93 and something else. 93 + something =76? That would require a negative number, which isn't possible here. So subtraction is better.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe use division to reduce one of the larger numbers. For example, 60 divided by something. 60 / 15 is 4. Then 4 * 3 =12. Then 93 -12=81. Not 76. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps combine 93 and 60 first. 93 -60=33. Then use 15 and 3. 33 +15=48, 48 *3=144. No. Not helpful. Alternatively, 93 minus 60 is 33, then 33 minus 15 is 18, then 18 divided by 3 is 6. Not 76. So that's not helpful.\n\nWhat if we use multiplication? Let's see. 15 *3=45. Then 45 plus 60=105. 105 minus 93=12. Not 76. Nope. Alternatively, 15 * 60=900. That's way too big. 900 divided by 93 is roughly 9.67. Not helpful. 900 - 93=807, then 807 divided by 3=269. Not useful.\n\nMaybe try 93 divided by something. 93 divided by 3 is 31. Then 31 plus 15=46. 60 minus 46=14. Not 76. Hmm. Or 93 divided by 3=31, then 60 -31=29, 29+15=44. Not 76.\n\nWhat about 60 divided by 3=20. Then 20 *15=300. Then 300 -93=207. Not helpful. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe subtract 15 from 60 first. 60-15=45. Then 45 *3=135. 135 -93=42. Not 76. Alternatively, 45 +3=48. 93 -48=45. Not 76.\n\nLet me think of another angle. Maybe start with 60 and 3. 60 -3=57. Then 57 +15=72. 72 + something. But we still have 93 left. 72 +93=165. That's over. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 60/15=4. Then 4*3=12. Then 93 -12=81. Still not 76.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use fractions. For example, 93 minus (60 divided by something). Let's see. 60 divided by (15/3) would be 60 divided by 5=12. Then 93-12=81. Still not 76. Hmm. If I do 60 divided by (15 -3)=60/12=5. Then 93 -5=88. Still not 76.\n\nWait another idea: Maybe 93 - (15 +3) =93-18=75. Close to 76. Then adding 1. But we need to use 60. How can we get 1 from 60? 60 divided by 60 is 1, but we already used 60. Wait, no. If we have 93 - (15+3) =75, then 75 + (60/60)=76. But 60 is already used once, but we can't reuse it. So that's not allowed.\n\nAlternatively, can we make 76 by adding 60 and 16? 60 +16=76. Then need to get 16 from 93,15,3. Let's see. 93 divided by 15 is about 6.2. 93 - (15*5)=93-75=18. 18 -3=15. No. Hmm. Not helpful. 15 +3=18. 93 -18=75. Then 75 +1=76. But again, 1 would need to come from 60, but how? 60 divided by 60=1, but we can't use 60 again. So that's not possible.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach. Let's think of 76 as (something) multiplied by (something else) plus or minus something. Let's see. 15 * 5 =75, which is close. Then 75 +1=76. So, can I get 5 and 1 from the remaining numbers? The remaining numbers would be 3, 60, 93. Wait, but that's three numbers. Wait, no. Wait, if I use 15 in 15*5, then I need to get 5 from 3,60,93. 60 divided by (93 - something). Hmm, this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, 60 divided by 3 is 20. Then 20 * something. 20*3.8=76. But 3.8 is not easy to get. Or 20*3=60, which we already have.\n\nHmm. Maybe using 93 and 60. Let's subtract them: 93-60=33. Then, 33 plus 15=48. 48 divided by 3=16. 16 is not 76. Alternatively, 33*3=99. 99-15=84. Not 76.\n\nWait, maybe 93 minus something equals 76. Let me check again. 93-17=76. So how to make 17 from 15,3,60. Let's see: 15 + (something). 15 +2=17. But 2 from 3 and 60? 60 divided by (3* something). 60 divided by 30 is 2. So 3*10=30. But 10 comes from 60 divided by 6? Wait, this is getting too convoluted. Alternatively, 3 + (60 divided by something). For example, 60 divided by 15=4. Then 3 +4=7. Not 17.\n\nWait, perhaps 60 divided by 3 is 20. Then 20 -15=5. 5 is not helpful. Hmm.\n\nAnother angle: Let's try to use division with 93 and 3. 93 divided by 3 is 31. Then 31 plus 15=46. 60 minus 46=14. Not 76.\n\nWait, maybe 93 minus (60 divided by (15 divided by 3)). Let's compute that. 15 divided by 3 is 5. Then 60 divided by 5 is 12. Then 93-12=81. No. Still not 76.\n\nHmm. Maybe I need to combine operations in a different way. Let's consider parentheses.\n\nWhat if I do (93 - 60) =33, then 33 * 3=99. Then 99 -15=84. Still no.\n\nWait, 15*3=45. Then 60-45=15. Then 15 +93=108. Not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps 93 - (15 * 3) =93-45=48. Then 60 -48=12. 12 isn't 76. No.\n\nAlternatively, 60 - (93 / (15 -3)). Let's compute denominator: 15-3=12. 93/12=7.75. 60 -7.75=52.25. Not 76.\n\nHmm. This is challenging. Let me list out all possible combinations step by step.\n\nPossible operations between pairs:\n\nFirst, let's consider combining 93 and 15:\n\n93 +15=108. Then use 3 and 60. 108 -3=105. 105 -60=45. Not 76.\n\n93 -15=78. Then 78 -3=75. 75 +60=135. No.\n\n93 *15=1395. Too big. Not useful.\n\n93 /15=6.2. Then 6.2 +3=9.2. 9.2 *60=552. No.\n\nNow combining 93 and 3:\n\n93 +3=96. 96 -15=81. 81 +60=141. No.\n\n93 -3=90. 90 -15=75. 75 +60=135. No.\n\n93*3=279. 279 -15=264. 264 -60=204. No.\n\n93/3=31. 31*15=465. 465 -60=405. No.\n\nCombining 93 and 60:\n\n93+60=153. 153 -15=138. 138/3=46. No.\n\n93-60=33. 33*3=99. 99-15=84. No.\n\n93*60=5580. Way too big.\n\n93/60=1.55. Not helpful.\n\nCombining 15 and 3:\n\n15+3=18. Then 93-18=75. 75 +60=135. No.\n\n15-3=12. 60/12=5. 93-5=88. Close to 76? 88-12=76. Wait, but we already used 15 and 3 here. Wait, let's see:\n\nIf 15-3=12, then 60/12=5. Then 93-5=88. But we still have 12 left (from 15-3) and 88. But we need to use all numbers. Wait, no. Because 15 and 3 are used in 15-3=12. Then 12 is part of the 60/12. Then 93-5=88. But that's 15,3,60,93 all used. Then we have 88, which is not 76. So no.\n\nAlternatively, 15*3=45. Then 93-45=48. Then 60-48=12. Not helpful.\n\nHmm. Let's think of another approach. Maybe combining 60 and 15 first.\n\n60/15=4. Then 4*3=12. Then 93-12=81. No.\n\n60-15=45. 45*3=135. 135-93=42. No.\n\n60+15=75. Then 75 + (93/3)=75 +31=106. No.\n\nWait, 93 divided by 3 is 31. 31 +60=91. 91 -15=76! Wait, let me check that again.\n\nSo 93 divided by 3 is 31. Then 31 +60=91. Then 91 minus 15=76. But are all numbers used? Let's see:\n\n93 is used in division by 3 (so 3 is used). Then 60 is added, and 15 is subtracted. Yes: 93, 3, 60, 15. All numbers used once. Let me write the equation:\n\n93 / 3 + 60 - 15 = 76.\n\nLet's compute step by step:\n\n93 divided by 3 is 31. 31 +60 is 91. 91 -15 is 76. Yes! That works.\n\nSo the equation is (93 / 3) + 60 - 15 = 76. But since we need to use all numbers exactly once and in the equation. Let me check:\n\nNumbers used: 93, 3, 60, 15. Each used once. All used. Operations: division, addition, subtraction. That's allowed.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(93 / 3) + 60 - 15 = 76</answer>"}]}

Each number has to be used exactly once, and the result should be 303. The operations allowed are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Let me start by thinking about how these numbers can combine to reach 303.\n\nFirst, I notice that 295 is already a large number close to 300. If I can somehow add 8 to 295, that would give me 303. Let me check if the other numbers can make 8. The remaining numbers are 22, 2, and 6. Hmm, 22 minus (6 + 2) would be 14, which is too much. Alternatively, maybe 22 divided by something? 22 divided by 2 is 11, and then 11 minus 6 is 5. Not helpful. What if I subtract 22 from something? Wait, maybe 6 divided by 2 is 3, then 22 minus 3 is 19. Still not 8.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can multiply some numbers. 6 times 2 is 12. If I subtract 12 from 22, that's 10. Then 295 + 10 is 305, which is 2 over. Hmm. Not quite. What if I add 22 and 6? 22 + 6 is 28. Then 28 divided by 2 is 14. Adding that to 295 gives 309, which is too high. \n\nWait, perhaps instead of adding to 295, I can subtract something. Let's see: 295 + 22 = 317. Then I need to subtract 14 to get 303. How can I get 14 from 2 and 6? 6*2 is 12, but 12 + 2 would be 14, but I already used 2. Wait, no, 6*2 is 12, but 12 plus the remaining 2? But I already used 2 in that multiplication. Since each number can only be used once, I can't do that. So maybe 6 / 2 is 3, then 22 - 3 is 19. Then 295 +19 is 314, which is even higher. Not good.\n\nLet me think differently. What if I use multiplication with the larger numbers. 22 times 6 is 132. Then 132 plus 2 is 134. Adding that to 295 would be 429, way too high. Alternatively, 22 times 2 is 44. 44 plus 6 is 50. 295 +50 is 345, still too high.\n\nMaybe subtract something from 295. If I have 22 and 6 and 2, perhaps combine them to make a number to subtract. For example, 22 +6 +2 =30. 295 -30 is 265. Not helpful. Or 22*6=132, 295-132=163. Then 163 plus 2 is 165. No.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 295 minus (22 * (6/2)). Let's compute 6/2=3. Then 22*3=66. 295-66=229. Not helpful. \n\nWait, maybe adding 22 and 6 first? 22 +6=28. Then 28*2=56. 295 +56=351. Still no. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, 295 + (22 * (6 -2)). Let's see: 6-2=4, 22*4=88. 295 +88=383. Nope.\n\nWait, perhaps using division. Let's see: 6 divided by 2 is 3. Then 22*3=66. Then 295 +66=361. Still no.\n\nWait another angle: Maybe 22*2=44. Then 44 +6=50. 50 +295=345. Not 303. \n\nAlternatively, 295 + 22 =317. Then 6 divided by 2 is 3. So 317 -3=314. Not 303. \n\nHmm. Let's try to get 303 by another combination. Maybe subtract some number from a larger product. For example, 22*6=132. Then 132*2=264. 264 +something=303. 303-264=39. But I don't have 39. Wait, or maybe 22*2=44, 44*6=264. Same as before.\n\nAlternatively, 295 plus (6*2) is 295 +12=307. Then 307 -22=285. No. \n\nWait, maybe 295 plus 6 is 301. Then 301 +2=303. But then I have to use 22. Oh, but I can't leave 22 unused. So that's not possible. Because all numbers must be used once. So that approach can't work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 22* (something) added or subtracted to 295. Let's see, 22* (6 +2) =22*8=176. 295-176=119. Not helpful. \n\nWait, what if I do 295 - (22 - (6/2))? Let's compute: 6/2=3, 22-3=19, 295-19=276. Not 303. \n\nAlternatively, 295 + (22 - (6/2)). 22 -3=19. 295+19=314. No.\n\nHmm, maybe subtract 2 from 295 to get 293, then add 22 and 6. 293+22+6=321. No.\n\nWait, perhaps using division in a different way. Let's see. 22 divided by 2 is 11. Then 11*6=66. 295+66=361. No. \n\nOr 6 divided by (22/2). Let's see: 22/2=11, then 6/11 is a fraction. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 295 + ( (22 -6) * 2 ). 22-6=16, 16*2=32. 295+32=327. No. \n\nWait, 22*2=44. Then 44 +6=50. Then 295 +50=345. Not 303. \n\nAlternatively, 295 -22=273. Then 273 + (6*2)=273+12=285. No. \n\nWait, maybe 295 +6=301. Then 301 + (22/2)=301 +11=312. No. \n\nHmm. This is tricky. Let me try to list all possible combinations.\n\nWe need to use all four numbers: 295,22,2,6. Let's consider possible operations.\n\nOne approach is to split the numbers into two pairs, compute each pair, then combine the results. Let's see:\n\nPair 295 and 22: Maybe 295 +22=317. Then combine with 2 and6. But 317 and 2,6. How to get 303 from that? 317 - (6 +2)=309. No. 317 - (6*2)=317-12=305. Close, but not 303. Or 317 - (6/2)=317-3=314. No.\n\nAlternatively, 295 -22=273. Then 273 needs to be combined with 2 and6. 273 +6 +2=281. No. 273 +6*2=273+12=285. No.\n\nAlternatively, 295 multiplied by 22 is too big. 295 divided by22 is around 13.4. Not helpful.\n\nOther pairings: Maybe pair 295 with 2. 295 +2=297. Then 297 needs to be combined with 22 and6. 297 +22 +6=325. No. 297 + (22*6)=297+132=429. No. 297 - (22*6)=297-132=165. No.\n\nOr 295 -2=293. Then 293 with 22 and6: 293 +22 +6=321. No. 293 +22*6=293+132=425. No.\n\nAlternatively, pair 295 and6. 295+6=301. Then combine with22 and2. 301 +22 +2=325. No. 301 +22-2=321. No. 301 -22 +2=281. No. 301 - (22*2)=301-44=257. No.\n\nAlternatively, 295 -6=289. Then with22 and2: 289+22+2=313. Close to 303, but 10 more. 289 + (22*2)=289+44=333. No.\n\nWhat if we pair 22 and2? Let's see: 22+2=24. Then 24 with 295 and6. 24 +295 +6=325. No. 24*6=144; 295 +144=439. No. 24*295= too big. 295 -24=271. 271 +6=277. No.\n\nAlternatively, 22*2=44. Then 44 with295 and6. 295 +44 +6=345. No. 295 -44=251. 251 +6=257. No. 44*6=264. 264 +295=559. No. \n\nAlternatively, 22/2=11. Then 11 with295 and6. 295+11+6=312. Close. 295 + (11*6)=295+66=361. No. 295 -11=284. 284 +6=290. No.\n\nAlternatively, 22 -2=20. Then 20 with295 and6. 295 +20 +6=321. No. 295 +20*6=295+120=415. No.\n\nHmm, maybe pair 6 and2. 6+2=8. Then 8 with295 and22. 295 +22 +8=325. No. 295 +22*8=295+176=471. No. 295 -22*8=295-176=119. No.\n\nAlternatively, 6*2=12. Then 12 with295 and22. 295+12+22=329. No. 295+12-22=285. No. 295 -12=283. 283 +22=305. Close. 305- something? But we already used all numbers except maybe that 283 +22=305. Wait, but 12 was from 6 and2. So 295 -12=283, then 283 +22=305. But that uses 295,6,2,22. All numbers. But 305 isn't 303. Hmm. Wait, 295 - (6*2) = 295-12=283. Then 283 +22=305. But that's 305. So 2 less than 303. Hmm. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 6/2=3. Then 3 with295 and22. 295 +22 +3=320. No. 295 +22*3=295+66=361. No. 295 -22*3=295-66=229. No.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe use three numbers first and then combine with the fourth. For example, take 22,2,6 and make a number that when combined with 295 gives 303.\n\nSo, let's say we have 22,2,6. Let's try to make 8 (since 295 +8=303). How can 22,2,6 make 8? Let's see:\n\n22 - (6 +2) =14. Not 8. 22/(6 +2)=22/8=2.75. Not helpful. 6/(22-2)=6/20=0.3. No. (22 -6)/2=16/2=8. Oh! Wait, that works. (22 -6)/2 = 16/2=8. So then 295 +8=303. That uses all numbers: 295,22,6,2. Let me check:\n\n(22 -6) =16, 16/2=8. Then 295 +8=303. Yes! So the equation would be 295 + ((22 -6)/2) =303. Let's verify:\n\n22 -6 =16, 16 divided by2 is 8. 295 +8=303. Perfect. All numbers used once: 295,22,6,2. Operations are subtraction, division, and addition. Each number used once. That works.\n</think>\n\n<answer>295 + (22 - 6) / 2 = 303</answer>"}]}

Each number must be used exactly once, and I can use the basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Hmm, how should I approach this?\n\nFirst, maybe I should look at the target number, which is 73. One of the numbers is 73 itself. So, perhaps I can use 73 in a way that it cancels out other numbers or combines with them to get 73. But since all numbers must be used, I can't just have 73 = 73; I need to incorporate the other numbers as well.\n\nLet me list the numbers again: 64, 73, 100, 36. The target is 73. So maybe I can structure it as 73 plus something that equals 73, but then the other numbers would have to sum to zero. For example, 73 + (something - something) = 73. Let's see if that's possible.\n\nLet's try: 73 + (64 + 36 - 100). Let's calculate that. 64 + 36 is 100, so 100 - 100 is 0. Then 73 + 0 = 73. Wait, that works! So the equation would be 73 + (64 + 36 - 100) = 73. Let me check if all numbers are used once: 73, 64, 36, 100. Yes, all four are used. The operations here are addition and subtraction. Let me write that out: 73 + (64 + 36 - 100) = 73. But the problem says each number can only be used once, and here 73 is used once, 64 once, 36 once, and 100 once. So that works. But wait, the parentheses might need to be adjusted. Let me verify the order of operations. The expression inside the parentheses is 64 + 36 = 100, then 100 - 100 = 0. Then 73 + 0 = 73. So yes, that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way. Let me check another possibility. For example, if I use multiplication or division. But since 73 is a prime number, maybe division could help. Let's think: 100 divided by something equals 73? 100 divided by (something) = 73 would mean that something is 100/73 ≈ 1.369, but that's not one of our numbers. Alternatively, 73 times something plus or minus others. But that might complicate things. Let me see if the first idea works.\n\nSo the equation would be 73 + (64 + 36 - 100) = 73. Simplifying the parentheses first: 64 + 36 is 100, then subtract 100 gives 0. Then 73 + 0 is 73. That seems correct. All numbers are used once. Let me just make sure that there's no requirement against using the target number as part of the equation. The problem says to create an equation that equals 73, so using 73 in the equation is allowed. \n\nAnother approach: Maybe subtract 64 and 36 from 100 and then add 73. Wait, 100 - 64 -36 = 0, then 0 +73 =73. But that's the same as before. So the equation would be 73 + (100 -64 -36) =73. Let's check that: 100 -64 is 36, 36 -36 is 0, then 73 +0=73. That also works. So that's another way to write it. So either using addition in the parentheses or subtraction. \n\nBut according to the problem, the example uses parentheses, so maybe using parentheses to group the operations. Let's see: 73 + (100 -64 -36). That's 73 + (100 -64 is 36; 36 -36 is 0). So yes. So both versions work. But the first version I thought of with (64 +36 -100) is also valid. Either way, the result is the same. \n\nAre there any other possible equations? Let's see. Maybe using division. For example, 100 divided by something. Let's try 100 divided by (something) plus or minus others. Let's say 100 / (some combination) plus others. For instance, 100/(64 -36) +73. Wait, 64 -36 is 28, then 100/28 ≈3.571, and adding 73 gives ≈76.571, which is not 73. Not helpful. Or maybe 73 - (100/(64 -36)). That would be 73 - (100/28) ≈73 -3.571≈69.429, not 73. \n\nHow about multiplication: 64 * something. If I take 64 * (100 -73) /36. Let's compute 100-73=27. Then 64*27=1728. 1728 divided by 36 is 48. 48 is not 73. Doesn't work. \n\nAlternatively, 36 * something. 36 * (100 -64)/73. Let's see: 100-64=36. 36*36=1296. 1296 /73 ≈17.75. Not 73.\n\nHmm. Maybe (64 + 36) / (100 -73). 64+36=100, 100-73=27. 100/27≈3.703. Not 73. \n\nAnother angle: Maybe use subtraction from 100. For example, 100 - something =73. Then something would be 27. So can we make 27 using 64, 73, 36? Wait, but we have to use all numbers. So if 100 - (64 -36) -73. Let's check: 64 -36=28. 100-28=72. 72-73= -1. Not 73. \n\nAlternatively, 100 - (73 - (64/36)). Let's compute 64/36≈1.777, 73 -1.777≈71.222. 100-71.222≈28.777. Not 73. \n\nHmm. Not helpful. Let's go back to the first solution. It seems the simplest way is to use 73 plus the combination of the other numbers that sum to zero. So 73 + (64 +36 -100) =73. That uses all numbers once. Alternatively, 73 + 64 +36 -100=73. Which is the same thing but without parentheses. But order of operations might not matter here because addition and subtraction are left to right. Let's check: 73 +64 is 137, +36 is 173, -100 is 73. Yes, that works. So the equation is 73 +64 +36 -100=73. But wait, does that use all numbers once? Yes: 73,64,36,100. So that's another valid expression. But the problem allows using operations multiple times, so that's okay. But the question is, do I need to use parentheses? The example given is (1+2)/3, but maybe it's not necessary here. Let me check.\n\nIf written as 73 +64 +36 -100 =73, that's a valid equation. But let's confirm the calculation. 73 +64=137; 137+36=173; 173-100=73. Yes. So that's correct. Therefore, this equation uses all numbers once with only addition and subtraction. That might be the simplest way. \n\nBut let me check if the problem requires parentheses. The example shows parentheses, but the problem says you can use operations as needed. So maybe either is acceptable. However, the problem might expect parentheses if there's a need to group operations. In the equation 73 +64 +36 -100, the order of operations doesn't require parentheses because addition and subtraction are done left to right. So it's valid without parentheses. \n\nBut the user might prefer the answer in a form that's grouped, but either way, as long as the equation is correct. So perhaps the answer can be written as 73 + 64 + 36 - 100 =73. Or even (73 +64) + (36 -100)=73. Let's check that. 73+64=137; 36-100=-64; 137 + (-64)=73. Yes, that's also valid. So using parentheses to group them as (73 +64) + (36 -100)=73. \n\nEither way, all numbers are used once. So which one is better? The problem's example uses parentheses, but maybe the minimal parentheses version is better. Let me check the problem statement again: \"Return the final equation in <answer> </answer> tags, for example <answer>(1 + 2) / 3</answer>.\" The example uses parentheses where necessary for order of operations. In our case, the equation without parentheses would still evaluate correctly due to left associativity, but including parentheses might make it clearer. \n\nAlternatively, the answer could be written as 73 + (64 + 36 - 100) =73. Which uses parentheses to group the part that sums to zero. Either way, both are correct. I think either form is acceptable, but perhaps the one with parentheses is better to show the grouping explicitly. \n\nSo the final answer is either 73 + 64 + 36 - 100 =73 or 73 + (64 +36 -100)=73. Both are correct. Let me pick one. Maybe the parentheses version to match the example's style. So the answer would be <answer>73 + (64 + 36 - 100)</answer>.\n</think>\n\n<answer>73 + (64 + 36 - 100)</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using the numbers 74, 11, 3, and 28 exactly once each, with basic arithmetic operations, to get 850. Hmm. Let's start by thinking about how these numbers can combine.\n\nFirst, 850 is a pretty large number, so maybe multiplication will be involved. Let me check what 74 multiplied by 11 is. 74*11 is 814. That's close to 850 but not quite there. Then maybe add something. 814 + 28 is 842. Still not 850. Hmm. Alternatively, if I subtract 3, that's 811. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe 74 multiplied by something else. Let's see, 74*28 is 2072, which is way too big. 74*3 is 222. Also too small. What if I use division? Maybe 28 divided by something. 28/3 is about 9.33. Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe combine 11 and 3 first. 11*3 is 33. Then 74*33 is 2442. That's way too big. Subtract 28? 2442-28=2414. No. Not helpful.\n\nWhat if I do 74 * (11 + 3) ? That's 74*14=1036. Then subtract 28? 1036-28=1008. Still not 850. Hmm.\n\nOr 74 + 11 =85, then 85* something. 85*10=850. But how to get 10 from 3 and 28? 28 -3* something. Wait, 28 - 3*6 =10, but I can't use numbers more than once. Wait, 28 - (3* something) using 3 and 28. Maybe 28 - (3* something). If I do 28 - (3*6)=10, but I don't have a 6. Alternatively, 28 divided by something. 28 divided by 3 is about 9.33. Then 85 * 9.33 is around 800. Close but not exact.\n\nWait, maybe 74*(11) + 28*3. Let's calculate that: 74*11=814, 28*3=84. 814+84=898. That's over. Alternatively, 74*11=814, then 814 + (28-3)=814+25=839. Still not 850.\n\nWait, maybe subtract instead. 74*11=814. 850-814=36. So I need to get 36 from 3 and 28. Hmm. 28 +3=31. Not enough. 28*3=84. Too much. 28* something else. 28 + (3* something). But 3 is already used once. Wait, maybe 28 + (3* something) where \"something\" is from the numbers. But I can only use each number once.\n\nWait, maybe 28*3=84, then subtract something? But how? Wait, 74*11 + (28*3) =814+84=898. Then 898 minus something? But we have to use all numbers. So 74,11,3,28 are all used in that equation. So that's 74*11 +28*3=898. But 898 is 48 over 850. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 74*(11 + something). Let's see. If I do 11 + (28/3) then that's approximately 11 +9.33=20.33. 74*20.33≈1484. Way too big. \n\nHmm. Maybe 28*30 is 840. Then plus 10 is 850. But where do I get 30 and 10? Let's see. If I can make 30 from 74,11,3. Wait, 74-11=63. 63/3=21. Then 21*28=588. Not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, 11*3=33. Then 74+33=107. 107*8=856. Close. But 8 comes from where? 28 divided by 3.5=8, but I don't have 3.5. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe 74* (28 - (11 +3)). Let's calculate: 28-14=14. Then 74*14=1036. Not 850. \n\nWait, 28*3=84. Then 84*10=840. Need 10 more. But how? 11- (something). 11-1=10, but I don't have 1. Alternatively, 74/(something). 74/7.4=10. But 7.4 isn't available. Hmm.\n\nAnother approach: target 850. Let's factor 850. 850=85*10. 85 can be made from 74+11. Then 10 can be made from 28-3*6, but again, no 6. Wait, 28 -3* something. Maybe (28 -3) =25. Then 85*25=2125. Not helpful. Wait, but 85*10=850. So how to get 10 from 28 and 3. 28/ (3 + something). Wait, 28 divided by (3 + something) equals 10. So 3 + x =28/10=2.8. Then x= -0.2. Not possible. Alternatively, 3*(something) =10. But 10 isn't divisible by 3. \n\nAlternatively, (28 - 3) =25. Then 74*11=814. 814 +25=839. Not enough. 814 +36=850. How to get 36 from 28 and 3? 28 + (3* something). Wait, 28 +8=36. But where's the 8? 11-3=8. But we already used 11 and 3. Hmm. Not allowed.\n\nWait, maybe 74* (11 + (28/3)). Let's calculate 28/3≈9.333. 11+9.333≈20.333. 74*20.333≈1500. Not helpful.\n\nWait, another angle: 850 divided by 74 is approximately 11.486. So maybe if I can get around 11.486 using 11,3,28. But not sure.\n\nWait, 11 + (28/3) ≈11+9.333≈20.333. Then 20.333* something. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 74*(28 -11) =74*17=1258. Then subtract 3* something? 1258 -3* something=850. So 3* something=408. So something=136. But I don't have 136. Not possible.\n\nHmm. Maybe (74 -28) =46. Then 46*11=506. Then 506 +3* something=850. 850-506=344. So 3x=344 => x≈114.666. Not possible. \n\nWait, 74*11=814. Then 814 +36=850. So how to get 36 from 28 and 3. 28 + (3* something). But we can only use 28 and 3 once. Wait, 3*12=36. But 12 can be made by 28-16, but that uses numbers again. Alternatively, 28 + 3! =28 +6=34. Not 36. But factorials are not allowed here, as per the problem statement only basic operations.\n\nAlternatively, 28*(3) - (something). 28*3=84. 84-48=36. But 48 from where? Not possible.\n\nWait, maybe 28 + (3* something). But the only numbers left are 11 and 74, but they are already used. Wait, I have to use all four numbers. So maybe a different combination. Let me think again.\n\nWhat if I do (74 - 3) *11 +28. Let's compute: 71*11=781. 781 +28=809. Close, but not 850. \n\nAlternatively, (74 +28) * something. 74+28=102. 102* something. 102*8=816. 102*8.333≈850. How to get 8.333. 25/3≈8.333. But 25 is 28-3. So 102*( (28-3)/3 )=102*(25/3)=102*8.333≈850. But let's compute it exactly: 25/3 is 8.333..., 102*25=2550. 2550/3=850. Oh! Wait, that works. Let me check:\n\n(74 +28) * ((28 -3)/3) = (102) * (25/3) = 102 *25 /3 = (102/3)*25 =34*25=850. Yes! But wait, here I'm using 28 and 3 twice. Because (28 -3) uses 28 and 3, and then the division by 3 again. But the problem states each number can be used only once. So in this case, 3 is used twice: once in (28-3) and once in division by 3. That's not allowed. Each number must be used exactly once. So this approach is invalid.\n\nHmm. So that's a problem. So that equation would be (74 +28) * (28 -3)/3, but that uses 28 twice and 3 twice. So that's not allowed. So I can't do that.\n\nBack to the drawing board. Let's try to use all numbers once. So 74, 11, 3, 28. Let's see.\n\nWhat if I do 74 * 11 + (28 / something). Wait, 74*11=814. Then 28 /3≈9.333. So 814 +9.333≈823.333. Not enough. Alternatively, 28 -3=25. 814 +25=839. Still not 850. \n\nWait, 74*11=814. Then 814 + 36=850. But how to get 36 from 28 and 3. Maybe 3*12. But how to get 12. 28-16=12, but 16 isn't available. Alternatively, 3* something else. Hmm. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 11*28=308. Then 308*3=924. Then 924 -74=850. Wait, let's compute that. 11*28=308. 308*3=924. 924-74=850. Yes! So that's 11*28*3 -74=850. Let's check:\n\n11*28=308. 308*3=924. 924-74=850. Correct. And all numbers used once: 11,28,3,74. Yes! That works. So the equation is 11*28*3 -74=850. Let me verify again:\n\n11 multiplied by 28 is 308. Multiply by 3 gives 924. Subtract 74 gives 850. Exactly. So this uses all four numbers once each with the operations * and -. Perfect. So the equation is (11 * 28 * 3) -74 =850.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(11 * 28 * 3) - 74 = 850</answer>"}]}

Hmm, let's think.\n\nFirst, let's note that 713 is a pretty large number, so maybe I need to subtract or divide it by something to bring it down. Similarly, 25 and 16 are perfect squares, so maybe exponents could be involved, but wait, the problem says only basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) are allowed. So exponents aren't allowed. Got it.\n\nLet me start by considering possible combinations. Since 713 is the biggest number, maybe I can subtract something from it. Let's see: 713 - some combination of 16,25,29. Let's see what 16+25+29 is: 16+25=41, 41+29=70. So 713-70=643, which is way higher than 192. Not helpful. Maybe multiplication or division.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 713 divided by something. Let's see. 713 divided by 25 is approximately 28.5, which is still not close. 713 divided by 16 is around 44.56. Still not. 713 divided by 29... wait, 29 times 24 is 696, and 29*24=696, 29*25=725, so 713/29 is 24.586... Not a whole number. But maybe 713 divided by something else. Alternatively, maybe multiply 713 by a small number, but that would make it even bigger. Hmm.\n\nWait, 713 divided by 29. Let me check that. 29*24=696, 29*24.586≈713. So 713/29 is about 24.586. If I can use that in some way. Let me note that 24.586 is close to 25, but not exactly. Maybe subtract that from something else. But then I need to use all numbers. Alternatively, maybe multiply 713 with another number and then divide by something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe group other numbers. Let's see. Let's try combining 25 and 16 first. 25*16=400. Then if I subtract something. 400 - 29=371, which is still higher than 192. If I do 25+16=41. Then 713-41=672. 672 divided by 29? 672/29≈23.17, not 192. Not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps combining 25 and 29. 25+29=54. 713-54=659. Then 659 with 16? 659/16≈41.19. Not helpful. Alternatively, 25*29=725. Then 725 - 713=12. Then 12 *16=192. Oh! Wait, that could work. Let's check:\n\n25*29=725. Then 725 - 713=12. Then 12*16=192. But let's see if we can use all numbers here. The problem says we have to use all numbers exactly once. So, in this case, we used 25,29,713,16. But what about the remaining number? Wait, the numbers given are 16,25,713,29. Wait, there are four numbers, right? Wait, the user mentioned \"using the numbers 16,25,713,29, create an equation that equals 192. You must use all the numbers.\" So there are four numbers. So in the above example, I used all four: 25*29=725, 725-713=12, then 12*16=192. Wait, but 25,29,713,16 are all used. So that works? Let's check:\n\n(25*29 - 713) *16 = (725 -713)*16 =12*16=192. Yes! That uses all four numbers once each. The operations are multiply, subtract, multiply. Each number is used once. So the equation would be ((25 * 29) - 713) * 16 = 192. But let me verify the order of operations. Is the multiplication before subtraction? Yes. So (25*29) is 725, then subtract 713 gives 12, then multiply by 16 gives 192. Perfect. So that's the equation. Let me just check again:\n\n25 *29 =725\n\n725 -713=12\n\n12*16=192\n\nYes. All numbers used: 16,25,713,29. Each used once, operations are *, -, *.\n\nSo the equation is ((25 * 29) - 713) * 16 = 192.

Let me start by thinking about how these numbers can combine.\n\nFirst, 372 is a relatively large number, so maybe multiplication will be involved. Let me look at the numbers I have. The largest numbers here are 90 and 24. Let's see what 90 multiplied by something would give. 90 * 4 is 360, which is close to 372. Hmm, 372 - 360 is 12. Do I have a way to get 12 from the remaining numbers? The remaining numbers would be 19 and 6. 19 - 6 is 13, which is too much. 19 + 6 is 25. Not helpful. 19 * 6 is 114, which is way too big. 19 / 6 is about 3.16. Maybe that's not helpful. So maybe 90 multiplied by 4 plus something else? But how to get 4?\n\nAlternatively, maybe 24 can be used with 6. 24 divided by 6 is 4. So if I take 24 / 6 = 4. Then 90 * 4 = 360. Then 360 + 19 = 379, which is over. Wait, 379 is 7 over. Not helpful.\n\nWait, but maybe I can adjust. Alternatively, 24 * 6 = 144. Then 144 + 90 = 234. Then 234 + 19 = 253. That's way too low. Not helpful.\n\nWhat if I use 90 and 19 first. 90 * 19 is 1710, which is way too high. That's not useful. Maybe 90 minus 19 is 71, then multiply by something. 71 * 6 = 426, which is over. 71 * 5 is 355. Hmm. Not helpful.\n\nAnother approach: Let's see 24 and 90. 24 * 15 = 360. But how to get 15 from 19 and 6? 19 - 6 =13. Not 15. 19 +6=25. 19/6≈3.16. Not helpful. So maybe 24 * (something) plus 90.\n\nAlternatively, 90 divided by 6 is 15. So 90 /6 =15. Then 15 *24 =360. Then 360 +19= 379. Again, 379 is 7 over. Not helpful. So close but not exact.\n\nWait, maybe subtract instead? 90 /6=15, 15*24=360, then 360 -19=341. That's 31 less. Not helpful.\n\nHmm. Maybe a different combination. Let's see, 19 and 6. If I subtract them, 19-6=13. Then 13 * 24=312. 312 +90=402. Over by 30. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 19 +6=25. 25 *24=600. 600 -90=510. Still way over.\n\nWhat if I do 90 -24=66. Then 66*6=396. 396-19=377. Closer, but 377 is 5 over. Still not.\n\nAlternatively, 90*6=540. 540 -24=516. 516 -19=497. Still over.\n\nWait, maybe division could help. Let's see. 90 divided by (something). For example, 90/(6) is 15. Then 15*24=360. Then 360 +19=379. As before.\n\nAlternatively, 24 divided by 6 is 4. Then 90*4=360. 360 +19=379. Same as before.\n\nSo maybe I need to find another way. Let's think. 372 divided by 90 is about 4.13. So if I can get 4.13 from the remaining numbers... but not sure. Alternatively, 372 divided by 24 is 15.5. Hmm. 15.5 can be made from 90, 6, and 19? Let's see. 90 divided by 6 is 15. Then 15.5 would need 0.5 more. But how to get 0.5 from 19? Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe (90 - 6) =84. Then 84 * 4 = 336. But how to get 4 from 24 and 19? 24 -19=5, 24/19≈1.26. Not helpful. 19 -24= -5. No. 24 +19=43. Hmm. 84*4.38... Not useful.\n\nAlternatively, 90 +24=114. 114*3=342. Then 342 + something. 342 + 19=361, 361 +6=367. Still not 372.\n\nWait, 90 +24=114. 114 * (6 - (19/x))... Not sure. Maybe that's too convoluted.\n\nAnother angle: 19*24=456. 456 -90=366. 366 +6=372. Wait, that works! Let me check:\n\n19 multiplied by 24 is 456. Then subtract 90: 456 -90=366. Then add 6: 366 +6=372. Yes! But wait, the numbers used are 19,24,90,6. All used once. So the equation would be (19*24) -90 +6 = 372. Let's compute step by step:\n\n19*24=456.\n\n456-90=366.\n\n366+6=372. Yes, that works. So the equation is 19*24 -90 +6=372. Let me check if that uses all numbers once. 19,24,90,6. Yes. Each used once. Operations are * , -, +. All allowed. So this seems to work.\n</think>\n\n<answer>19 * 24 - 90 + 6 = 372</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using the numbers 36, 85, 85, 17, each exactly once, and the result should be 54. The operations allowed are +, -, *, /. Hmm, how to approach this?\n\nFirst, maybe I should list out all the numbers and think about possible combinations. Since there are two 85s, maybe that's a clue. Maybe subtract them? But 85 - 85 is 0, which might not help. Alternatively, adding them gives 170. Then using 36 and 17 with 170? Let me see.\n\nWait, 170 divided by something? If I take 85 + 85 = 170. Then 170 divided by (something). What if I do 170 - 36 - 17? Let's calculate: 170 - 36 is 134, then 134 -17 is 117. Not 54. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe multiply. 85 * something. Let's see, 85 * (36 / 17). Wait, 36/17 is roughly 2.117. 85 * 2.117 is about 180. Then subtract the other 85? 180 -85=95. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe combine subtraction and division. Let's see, if I take 85 - (something) =54. Let's see, 85 - x =54, so x=31. Can I make 31 from 36, 85,17? Wait, but the other numbers are 36, 85,17. Wait, but 85 is already used once. So perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe 85 - (36 -17). That's 85 -19=66. Not 54. Hmm.\n\nAnother approach: 36 is a big number. Maybe multiply 36 by something. 36 *1.5=54. So can I make 1.5 using 85,85,17? Let's see. 85 divided by (85 -17) is 85/68≈1.25. Not 1.5. Alternatively, (85 +17)/85=102/85≈1.2. Still not. Maybe 85/(85/ something). Wait, 85/(85/17)=17. So 36*17=612. Then subtract the other numbers? But that's way off.\n\nWait, maybe 85 - (85 / something). Let's try 85 - (85 /17). 85/17=5, so 85-5=80. Then 36-80= -44. Not helpful. Maybe 85 - (36/17). 36/17≈2.117, so 85-2.117≈82.88. Then 82.88 -85= -2.12. Not useful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 85 divided by something. 85/17=5. Then 5 +36=41, then 85 -41=44. No. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps combining the two 85s with division or subtraction. 85 -85=0. Then using 36 and17. 36 -17=19. 0 +19=19. No. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe (85 -85) + (36 +17). That's 0 +53=53. Close to 54, but not quite. Hmm.\n\nWhat if we do 85 divided by 17? That's 5. Then 36 +5=41, then 41 + (the other 85)=126. No. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, 36 multiplied by (85 -85) which is 0, then +17. That's 0+17=17. No.\n\nWait, maybe (85 +85) divided by something. 170 divided by (something) equals 54. So 170/x=54 → x≈3.148. Can we get that from 36 and17? 36-17=19, which is too big. 36/17≈2.117.

Not 54. Or 85*2=170. But how to get 2? 17/ (85- something). Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe 85 - (36 - (85/17)). Let's parse that: 85/17=5, so 36 -5=31, then 85-31=54. Wait, that works!

Each number has to be used exactly once, and I can only use basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Hmm, where to start?\n\nFirst, maybe I should see if there's a way to combine some of these numbers to get close to 155. Let's look at the numbers again: 79, 17, 202, 49. 202 is a pretty big number, so maybe subtracting or dividing it by something could help. 49 is also a square number, which might be useful in multiplication or division.\n\nLet's try some combinations. If I take 202 and subtract something to get 155. 202 - 47 = 155. Wait, but 47 isn't one of the numbers. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe 202 divided by something. 202 divided by approximately 1.3 is around 155, but that's not helpful here.\n\nWhat about 79? If I can add 79 to another number. 79 + 76 = 155. Again, 76 isn't available. Maybe 79 multiplied by 2 is 158, which is close. But again, not quite there. \n\nLet's think about 17. 17 times 9 is 153, which is close to 155. But we don't have 9. Maybe 17 times something else. 17*10=170, which is over. How about 17*49? Let me calculate that. 17*49 is 833. That's way too big. Maybe divide 833 by something. 833 divided by 5 is 166.6, which isn't helpful. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe combine 202 and 79. 202 - 79 is 123. Then add 17: 123 +17=140. Still need 15 more, but we've already used 202,79,17 and left 49. 140 +49=189, which is over. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe subtract 49 instead. 202 -79=123, 123+17=140, 140-49=91. Not close.\n\nAnother approach: Let's try using multiplication and division. For example, 202 divided by something. 202 divided by 1.3... but again, not helpful. How about 202 - (49 + 17) = 202 -66=136. Then 136 +79=215. No, that's 215. Not 155.\n\nWait, maybe 202 - (49 -17) = 202 -32=170. Then 170 -79=91. Still no.\n\nWhat if I do 79 +17=96. Then 202 -96=106. 106 +49=155. Wait, let me check that again. 79 +17=96. 202 -96=106. 106 +49=155. Oh! Wait, that works. Let me verify:\n\n202 - (79 +17) = 202 -96=106. Then 106 +49=155. Yes! So the equation would be (202 - (79 +17)) +49 =155. But I need to use all numbers exactly once. Let's see: 202,79,17,49. Yes, all are used once. Let me check the operations: subtraction, addition. So the equation is 202 -79 -17 +49. Let's compute that step by step: 202-79=123, 123-17=106, 106+49=155. Yes, that works. So the equation is (202 - 79 -17) +49 =155. Alternatively, written as 202 -79 -17 +49 =155. But since all operations are left to right, parentheses might not be necessary. Alternatively, maybe another order. But according to the problem, as long as the equation uses each number once and the operations, it should be fine. So perhaps 202 -79 -17 +49 =155.

But wait, I have to use all the numbers, so even if I have 54 as part of the equation, the other numbers need to somehow combine to not change the value. For example, 54 multiplied by something that equals 1, or added to something that equals 0. Let's explore that.\n\nIf I use 54 as a base, then I need to combine 5, 11, and 6 in such a way that they result in 0 or 1. Let's see:\n\nWhat if I do 54 + (5 - 5), but that requires using 5 twice, which I can't. Or 54 multiplied by (something). Let's think about operations.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe 54 is the result of combining the other numbers. Wait, but 54 is one of the inputs, so that might complicate things. Let's list possible combinations.\n\nFirst, let's consider the operations. Since we need to use all numbers, maybe group some together. For example, 5, 11, 6, and 54. Let's see:\n\nIf I take 11 and 5, maybe subtract them: 11 - 5 = 6. Then 6 * 6 = 36. But I already used 6 once, and can't reuse it. Alternatively, 11 + 5 = 16, then 16 - 6 = 10. Then 10 * something? But 54 is left, so 10 * 54 would be way too big. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe multiplication and division. Let's see. 54 divided by something. If I can make 54 divided by (something) equal to 54, then that something would need to be 1. So how to make 1 from 5, 11, 6. Like (11 - 5 - 6) = 0, but that's 0. Then 54 divided by that would be undefined. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 54 multiplied by (something) equals 54. That something is 1. So can I make 1 from 5, 11, 6? Let's try:\n\n11 - (5 + 6) = 0. Still zero. Not 1. Maybe (11 - 5) divided by 6? 6 divided by 6 is 1. Wait, 11 -5 is 6, then 6 /6 is 1. Then 54 * 1 = 54. Oh! Wait, that could work. Let's check:\n\n54 * ((11 -5)/6) = 54 * (6/6) = 54 *1 =54. Yes! But let's verify if all numbers are used once: 54 is used, 11, 5, and 6. Yes, each once. So the equation would be 54 * ((11 -5)/6) =54. So the equation is 54 * ((11 -5)/6) =54. Let me write that properly with parentheses: 54 * ( (11 - 5) / 6 ) =54. That uses all numbers once. Let me check the arithmetic: 11-5=6, 6/6=1, 54*1=54.

Let me start by thinking about multiplication because 494 is a relatively large number.\n\nLooking at the numbers, 70 and 26 are both factors that could contribute to a large product. Let's try multiplying some of the bigger numbers first. 70 times 26 is 1820. That's way bigger than 494. What about 70 times 14? That's 980, still too big. 95 times 14 is 1330. Hmm, not helpful. Maybe division could help reduce some numbers?\n\nWait, 494 divided by any of the numbers... Let me see. 494 ÷ 26 is 19. So if I can get 19 from the remaining numbers, which are 70, 95, and 14. But 70 and 95 and 14. How? 95 minus 70 is 25, then 25 minus 14 is 11. No. 95 divided by something... 95 divided by 5 is 19, but where do I get 5 from? The other numbers are 70, 26, 14. Hmm. Maybe not directly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 26 times something. 26 times 19 is 494. Let me see if I can make 19. Let's see, 95 - 70 is 25. 25 - 14 is 11. Not 19. Maybe 70 - (95 / something). 95 divided by 5 is 19. Wait, 70 divided by 14 is 5. Oh! So 95 divided by (70 / 14) equals 95 divided by 5, which is 19. Then 26 times 19 is 494. So putting it all together: 26 * (95 / (70 / 14)). Let's check that. 70 divided by 14 is 5. Then 95 divided by 5 is 19. 26 times 19 is indeed 494. That works!\n\nBut let me verify if all numbers are used once. 26, 95, 70, 14. Yes, each is used once. So the equation is 26 * (95 / (70 / 14)) = 494.

Let me list out the numbers I have: 43, 709, 9, 17.

How can I combine them to make 344? 43 multiplied by something. 43*8 is 344. Wait, but I don't have an 8. I have 9 and 17. Maybe 17 - 9 = 8. Then 43*(17-9) = 43*8 = 344.

What's 840 divisible by? Well, 840 is 8*105, which is 8* (15*7). Alternatively, 840 = 42*20, or 70*12. Maybe I can find a way to multiply two large numbers together to get close to 840.

Alternatively, if I can get 35 multiplied by 24, that's 840. So how can I get 24 using 44, 16, and 66? Let me see: 66 - 44 is 22, then 22 + 16 is 38. Not 24. Or 44 - (66 -16) = 44 -50= -6. Not useful. Maybe 66 divided by something. 66 divided by (44/16). Let's calculate that: 44 divided by 16 is 2.75. 66 divided by 2.75 is 24. So 66 / (44/16) = 24. Then 24 multiplied by 35 is 840. Let me check that:\n\n66 divided by (44/16) is 66 * (16/44) = (66/44)*16 = (3/2)*16 = 24. Then 24 *35 = 840. Yes! So putting it all together: (66 / (44/16)) *35 = 840. Let me verify if I used all numbers once. Yes: 66, 44, 16, and 35. So the equation is 35 * (66 / (44/16)) = 840. Alternatively, written as (66 / (44 ÷ 16)) × 35. Let me check the order of operations. Division first: 44 ÷16 is 2.75, then 66 divided by 2.75 is 24, multiplied by 35 is 840. Yep, that works. So the equation is 35 * (66 / (44 / 16)) = 840. Let me write that with parentheses properly. Alternatively, maybe rearrange the numbers. Let's see: 66 divided by (44 divided by 16) is 24, multiplied by 35. So yes, the equation would be (66 / (44/16)) * 35 = 840. Let me make sure that's correct. Yes, 44 divided by 16 is 2.75. 66 divided by 2.75 is indeed 24. 24 times 35 is 840. Perfect. So that uses all numbers once with multiplication, division, and division again. That should be the correct equation.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(66 / (44 / 16)) * 35 = 840</answer>"}]}

Each number must be used exactly once, and the result should be 304. The operations allowed are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let me note the target is 304. Let me look at the numbers I have. The numbers are 76, 286, 33, and 61. Hmm. Let me see if any of these numbers can combine in a way that gets close to 304.\n\nLet me start by considering the larger numbers first. 286 is the largest. If I subtract something from 286, maybe I can reach 304. But wait, 286 is less than 304, so subtracting would make it even smaller. So maybe adding? But 286 plus something. Let's see, 304 - 286 = 18. So if I can get 18 from the remaining numbers 76, 33, 61. But I have to use all numbers. Wait, that might not be possible. Alternatively, maybe 286 divided by something. Let me see, 286 divided by, say, 61 is approximately 4.688. Not sure. Alternatively, 286 - 76 = 210. Still not close to 304. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to multiply some numbers. Let's see. 76 * 4 is 304. Wait, 76 * 4 is exactly 304. So if I can create 4 using the other numbers (286, 33, 61), that could work. Let's see. How can I get 4 from 286, 33, and 61? Let's think. 286 divided by 61 is 4.688... Hmm, that's not 4. 33 minus 61? That's negative. 61 - 33 = 28. 286 divided by 28? Let's see, 286 ÷ 28 is approximately 10.214. Not helpful. Alternatively, maybe 286 minus 33 minus 61. 286 - 33 = 253, then 253 - 61 = 192. Not 4. Hmm. Wait, 286 - (33 + 61) = 286 - 94 = 192. Still not 4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 61 - (286 / 33). Let me calculate that. 286 ÷ 33 is approximately 8.666. 61 - 8.666 is about 52.333. Still not 4.\n\nHmm, maybe this approach isn't working. Let me try a different angle. Let's see if combining 76 and 61. 76 + 61 = 137. Then 137 + 33 = 170. 170 + 286 = 456. That's way over. Alternatively, 76 * 61 would be 4636, which is way too big. Maybe 76 - 61 = 15. Then 15 + 33 = 48. 48 + 286 = 334. Not 304. Hmm.\n\nWhat if I subtract some numbers? Let's try 286 - 76. That's 210. Then using 33 and 61. 210 + 61 = 271, plus 33 is 304. Wait, that works? Let me check:\n\n286 - 76 = 210\n\n210 + 61 = 271\n\n271 + 33 = 304\n\nWait, but that uses all the numbers. Let me verify:\n\n286 - 76 + 61 + 33 = 286 -76 is 210, plus 61 is 271, plus 33 is 304. Yes! So the equation would be 286 - 76 + 61 + 33 = 304. But I need to use all the numbers once each, and the operations. Wait, but in this case, the operations are subtraction and additions. So the equation would be ((286 - 76) + 61) + 33) but actually, the order doesn't matter because addition and subtraction are left associative. So perhaps written as 286 - 76 + 61 + 33. Let me check if that's correct.\n\nCalculating step by step:\n\n286 - 76 = 210\n\n210 + 61 = 271\n\n271 + 33 = 304. Yes, that works.\n\nSo the equation is 286 - 76 + 61 + 33 = 304. Wait, but all the numbers are used once. Let me confirm: 286, 76, 61, 33. Yes, all used once. So that's the answer. Wait, that seems straightforward. Did I overlook something? Maybe the problem requires using all four numbers with each operation used? But the problem states \"you can use basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) one or multiple times but each number can only be used once, and you must use all the numbers.\" So as long as all numbers are used once, the operations can be any combination. So this equation meets the requirements. Let me check again:\n\n286 - 76 = 210\n\n210 + 61 = 271\n\n271 + 33 = 304. Yep.\n\nSo the equation is 286 - 76 + 61 + 33 = 304.\n\nWait, but when written as an equation, the order of operations with just addition and subtraction is left to right. So 286 -76 is 210, then +61 is 271, then +33 is 304. So yes, that works. So the answer is (286 - 76) + 61 + 33, but since the order doesn't require parentheses, maybe it's written as 286 - 76 + 61 + 33.\n\nBut the problem says to return the equation in the answer tags, like the example. So maybe parentheses are not needed here. Let me see if the calculation would be the same without parentheses. Since it's all addition and subtraction, left to right, so 286 -76 is 210, then +61, then +33. So the equation is 286 -76 +61 +33 = 304. So that's acceptable.\n\nBut let me make sure there's no other possible equation using multiplication or division. Let me check. For instance, maybe 76 * something. Let's see, 76 * 4 is 304. How to get 4 from 286, 33, 61. Let's see. 286 - (33 * 61) would be way too big. 286 - (61 - 33) = 286 -28=258. Not 4. Alternatively, 286 divided by something. 286 / 61 is approximately 4.688. Not 4. 286 / 33 is approximately 8.666. Not helpful. Hmm. Alternatively, 61 - 33 =28. Then 286 /28 is approximately 10.214. So 76 * (286/(61-33)) =76 *10.214≈776. That's way over. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 33 +61=94. 286 -94=192. 192 +76=268. Not 304.\n\nAlternatively, 76 * (61 - (286 /33)). Let's compute 286 divided by 33. That's about 8.666. Then 61 -8.666≈52.333. 76 *52.333≈3973. Not helpful.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe using division and multiplication. Let me try 286 - (76 * (61 /33)). Let's compute 61/33 ≈1.848. 76*1.848≈140. Then 286 -140≈146. Not 304.\n\nAlternatively, 76 * 3 = 228. 228 +76=304. But 3 would need to come from other numbers, but maybe 61 - (286/33)=approx 61 -8.666=52.333. Not 3.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, maybe 286 + 33 =319. Then subtract something. 319 - 61=258. 258 -76=182. No. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 61 * 5 =305. Close to 304. But how to get 5 from other numbers. 33 -28=5. But 28 is from 76-48 or something. Not sure. Let's see, 61 * ( (286 -76)/ (33)) =61*(210/33)=61*6.3636≈388. Not helpful.\n\nHmm. Maybe another approach. Let's think of 304 as 61*5 -1. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, 33 * 9 = 297. 297 +7=304. But where would 9 and7 come from.\n\nAlternatively, 76 + 286 = 362. Then subtract 58 to get 304. 58 can be 33 +25. Not sure. 33 + (61-36)=58, but 36 is not available. Hmm.\n\nWait, 76 +286=362. 362 -61=301. Then 301 +3=304. But 3 from 33? 33 divided by 11=3, but 11 isn't there. Alternatively, 33 -30=3. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 76*4=304. As I thought earlier. To get 4, perhaps (286 - 61)/ (33 + something). Wait, 286-61=225. 225 divided by something. 225/56.25=4. But 56.25 is not available. Alternatively, (33 + (286/61)). Let's compute 286/61≈4.688. 33+4.688≈37.688. Not 4.\n\nAlternatively, (286 - (33* something)) /61. Let's see, if we want 4*61=244. 286-244=42. 42 divided by 33 is about 1.27. Not helpful.\n\nHmm, seems like the straightforward solution I found earlier is the correct one. Let me just verify again. 286 -76=210. 210 +61=271. 271 +33=304. Yes. All numbers used once: 286,76,61,33. So the equation is 286 -76 +61 +33 =304. Therefore, the answer is (286 - 76 + 61 + 33).\n</think>\n\n<answer>286 - 76 + 61 + 33</answer>"}]}

Each number has to be used exactly once, and the result should be 237. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should check what the target is. 237. Let me see what operations might get me close. Since the numbers are all relatively large, especially 87, 73, and 74, maybe combining some of them with multiplication or addition could get close. But 87 plus 73 is 160, plus 74 is 234, which is close but still 3 short. Then adding 3 would make it 237. But wait, that would use all numbers, but let me check: 87 + 73 + 74 + 3 = 237? Let's compute that: 87 + 73 is 160, 160 +74 is 234, 234 +3 is 237. Oh, that works! Wait, but that's just addition of all four numbers. So the equation would be 87 + 73 + 74 + 3 = 237. But the problem says I can use the basic operations (+, -, *, /) one or multiple times. But does that mean I need to use more than one operation? Wait, the question says \"create an equation that equals 237. You can use basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) one or multiple times but each number can only be used once, and you must use all the numbers.\"\n\nWait, but adding all four numbers would be using the + operation three times. So that's allowed. Let me check: 87 + 73 + 74 +3. Let me add them step by step. 87 +73 is 160, 160 +74 is 234, 234 +3 is 237. Yes, that's correct. So the equation is 87 +73 +74 +3 =237. But I need to write it with parentheses? Wait, the example given was (1 + 2)/3. So maybe I need to structure it with operations. But addition is associative, so parentheses might not be necessary. However, maybe the problem expects some combination of operations, not just all additions. Let me check again the problem statement.\n\nWait, the problem says \"You can use basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) one or multiple times but each number can only be used once, and you must use all the numbers.\" So if I use all four numbers with additions, that's acceptable. For example, 87 +73 +74 +3 = 237. So that's a valid equation. But maybe the problem expects a more complex equation, perhaps using different operations. Let me verify that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can create a more complex equation. Let me check if that's necessary. Let's see, adding all four numbers gives 237. So maybe the answer is simply 87 + 73 +74 +3. But in that case, let me check the arithmetic again. 87 +73 is 160, 160 +74 is 234, 234 +3 is 237. Correct. So that uses each number once, all numbers, and only addition operations. So that's allowed. But maybe the problem is expecting that, but I need to make sure. Let me think if there's another way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using multiplication. Let's see. For example, 3 * 74 = 222. Then 222 + 87 = 309, which is over. Or 3 * 73 = 219. Then 219 + 87 = 306, still over. Hmm. Alternatively, 74 *3 is 222, then 222 plus 87 is 309, minus 73 would be 309-73=236. Close, but not 237. 309-72=237, but I don't have 72. Alternatively, 87 *3 = 261. Then 261 +73 =334, which is way over. 87*3=261, then 74 +73=147. 261 +147=408. That's too much. Not helpful.\n\nAnother approach: maybe 87 + (74 - 3) * something. Let's see: 74 -3 =71. 71*3=213, but that's using 3 again. Wait, no, we can't reuse numbers. So 74 -3 is 71. Then 71* something. But we have 87 and 73 left. Wait, maybe 71 *3 is 213, but 3 is already used. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, 87 - 3 =84. Then 84 multiplied by something. Let's see: 84 *3=252, but that uses 3 again. No. 84 *73 would be way too big. 84*73=6132, which is way over. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 87 -74=13. 13 * something. 13*18=234, but we don't have 18. Wait, maybe 13* (73 -3). 73-3=70. 13*70=910. That's way over.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, let's see if division can help. For example, 87 /3=29. Then 29 +73 +74=29+73=102, +74=176. Not enough. 29*73=2117, which is way too big.\n\nOr 74 / something. 74/3 is about 24.666. Then adding 87 and 73: 24.666 +87=111.666 +73=184.666. Not helpful.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe combine subtraction and addition. For example, 87 +73=160, then 160 +74=234, then +3=237. So that's the same as adding all four. So the equation would be 87 +73 +74 +3=237. But perhaps written as (87 +73) + (74 +3) =237, but parentheses aren't necessary. But according to the problem's example, they used parentheses even when not necessary, like (1 +2)/3. So maybe the answer can be written as 87+73+74+3. But I need to check if that's acceptable.\n\nWait, the problem says \"create an equation that equals 237. You can use basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) one or multiple times but each number can only be used once, and you must use all the numbers.\"\n\nSo adding all four numbers is acceptable. So the answer is 87 +73 +74 +3 =237. But when writing the equation in the answer tag, maybe we can write it as (87 +73) +74 +3, but perhaps just 87+73+74+3. Let me check if that's correct.\n\nYes, 87+73 is 160, plus 74 is 234, plus 3 is 237. So that's correct. Therefore, the answer is 87+73+74+3. But maybe the problem expects more complex operations. But since the problem allows using operations one or multiple times, addition is allowed. So this is a valid solution.\n\nWait, but maybe there's another way that uses different operations. Let me see. For instance, 87 *3 =261. Then 261 -74=187. Then 187 +73=260. No, that's 260, which is not 237. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 73*3=219. Then 219 +87=306. 306-74=232. Not 237. Close. 232 is 5 less than 237. Not helpful.\n\nAnother approach: 74*3=222. Then 222 +87=309. 309-73=236. Again, one less than 237. Hmm. Close, but not there.\n\nAlternatively, 87 + (74 *3) =87 +222=309. 309 -73=236. Still off by one.\n\nAlternatively, 73*3=219. 219 +74=293. 293 -87=206. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe using division. Let's see. 87 divided by 3 is 29. Then 29 +73=102. 102 +74=176. No. Not close.\n\nAlternatively, 74 / (3) is approximately 24.666. Then 24.666 +87=111.666 +73=184.666. Not helpful.\n\nHmm. Maybe using subtraction. For example, 87 -3=84. Then 84 +73=157. 157 +74=231. 231 is 6 less than 237. Hmm, that's not helpful. Then adding 6, but we don't have 6.\n\nAlternatively, 74 -3=71. 71* something. 71*3=213, but that uses 3 again. No. Then 213 +87=300, then 300-73=227. Not helpful.\n\nHmm. It seems that the only straightforward way is to add all four numbers. Let me check again:\n\n87 +73=160\n\n160 +74=234\n\n234 +3=237. Yep. So that works.\n\nTherefore, the equation is 87 +73 +74 +3=237. Since all numbers are used once and only addition operations are used, which is allowed.\n\nSo the answer is <answer>87 + 73 + 74 + 3</answer>.\n</think>\n\n<answer>87 + 73 + 74 + 3</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using all the numbers 72, 10, 12, and 10 exactly once, with basic arithmetic operations, and the result should be 864. Hmm. Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, 864 is a pretty big number. Let me check what 72 multiplied by 12 gives. 72*12 is 864. Oh, that's exactly the target number! So if I can get 72 multiplied by 12 somehow using the other numbers 10 and 10, then maybe that's the way to go.\n\nBut wait, I have to use all four numbers: 72, 10, 12, 10. So if I already use 72 and 12 to multiply, then I need to incorporate the two 10s into the equation. But since multiplication gives me the desired result directly, how can I involve the 10s without changing the product? Maybe by adding or subtracting them in a way that cancels out? Or perhaps using division?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can arrange the numbers so that the 10s are used in an operation that results in a factor that when multiplied by 72 and 12 gives 864. Wait, but 72*12 is already 864. So if I can somehow make the 10s not affect that product. For example, 72 * 12 + (10 - 10) would be 864 + 0 = 864. But does that count? The problem states that I must use all the numbers. So adding (10 -10) would use both 10s, but is that allowed? Let me check the rules again: \"each number can only be used once, and you must use all the numbers.\" So yes, using both 10s in a subtraction would be okay. So the equation would be 72 * 12 + (10 - 10) = 864. But wait, 10 -10 is zero, so adding that doesn't change the value. But is that acceptable? The problem doesn't say that the operations have to be necessary, just that all numbers are used. So maybe that's a valid approach. But perhaps the problem expects all numbers to be used in a more integral part of the equation, not just cancelling them out. Let me see if there's another way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe combine the 10s first. If I do 10 * 10, that's 100. Then, 72 * 12 is 864. Wait, but how can I combine 100 and 864? Because 864 divided by 100 is 8.64, which isn't helpful. Or maybe 72 * (12 + 10 +10). Wait, 12 +10+10=32. 72*32=2304. That's way over. Not helpful.\n\nWhat if I subtract the 10s from something? For example, 72 * (12 - (10/10)). Let's compute that. 10/10 is 1, so 12-1=11. Then 72*11=792, which is less than 864. Not enough.\n\nAlternatively, 72 * (12 + (10/10)). 10/10=1, so 12+1=13. 72*13=936. Still not 864.\n\nHmm. Maybe use division. If I do (72 * 12) / (10 /10). Since 10/10 is 1, this is 864/1=864. But that uses all numbers: 72,12,10,10 in the equation (72*12)/(10/10). That works. Let's check: 10 divided by 10 is 1, then 72 multiplied by 12 is 864, divided by 1 is 864. So yes. That uses all numbers once. Let me verify:\n\n(72 * 12) / (10 / 10) = 864 / 1 = 864. Perfect. So the equation would be (72 * 12) / (10 / 10). That uses all four numbers, each exactly once, and the operations are division and multiplication. That should work.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(72 * 12) / (10 / 10)</answer>"}]}

Maybe I can subtract them to get zero or use them in a way that cancels out. But then I still have 96 and 1 left. Wait, but the target is 96, so maybe 96 is part of the equation in a way that doesn't change it. Like multiplying by 1 or adding zero.\n\nLet me try combining the two 37s. If I subtract them: 37 - 37 = 0. Then, if I do 96 + 0 + 1, that would be 97, which is too much. Alternatively, 96 × 1 + 0 = 96. Wait, that could work. Let's structure that.\n\nSo, using 96 multiplied by 1 gives 96, and then adding (37 - 37) which is zero. So the equation would be 96 × 1 + (37 - 37) = 96. But does that use all the numbers? Yes: 96, 1, 37, 37. Each used once. But I need to check if the operations are allowed. Multiplication and addition and subtraction. That's acceptable.

Each number has to be used exactly once, and the result should be 900. Let's start by thinking about the operations that can get me close to 900. \n\nFirst, looking at the numbers, 732 is the largest. If I could subtract something from 732 to get near 900, but wait, 732 is already less than 900. Hmm, maybe adding numbers? But 732 plus 67 is 799, and adding 27 gets to 826, still not 900. Maybe multiplying?\n\nIf I multiply 27 by something. Let's see: 27 times 34 is 918, which is close. How can I get 34 from the remaining numbers? Wait, 732 divided by something? Let me check. The numbers left would be 67, 74, and 732. If I do 732 divided by (74 - 67), that's 732 divided by 7, which is about 104.57. Then 27 times that would be way over. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 732 minus something. 732 minus 67 is 665. Then maybe 665 plus 74 is 739, and 739 plus 27 is 766. Not close. \n\nWhat if I use division to reduce a number? Like 732 divided by something. Let's say 732 divided by 74. That's approximately 9.89. Then multiply by 27? 9.89 * 27 is around 267. Still too low. \n\nWhat if I use 67 and 74 in a way that multiplies to a higher number. 67 times 74 is 67*70=4690 plus 67*4=268, so total 4958. That's way too big, but maybe if I divide 732 by something. Wait, 732 divided by 27 is about 27.11. Then 27.11 * 67 = around 1816, which is still not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (732 - 67) * something. 732 - 67 = 665. 665 times 1.35 would be around 900, but how to get 1.35 from 27 and 74? 74 divided by 27 is about 2.74. Not 1.35. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe combine subtraction and multiplication. Let's think: 74 - 27 = 47. Then 47 times something. 47*19 is 893, close to 900. But how to get 19 from 732 and 67? 732 divided by 67 is roughly 10.925. Not 19. Alternatively, 67 - (732 / something). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 732 + something. 732 + 67 = 799. Then add 74 to get 873. Still need 27 more, but we already used all numbers. Not allowed. \n\nWait, maybe use a combination of multiplication and division. Let's see: 732 divided by 74. Let's compute that exactly. 74*9=666, 74*10=740. 732 is 740 -8, so 10 - 8/74 ≈ 9.891. Then multiply by 27: 9.891*27 ≈ 267. Not helpful.\n\nWhat if I take 67 * 74 = 4958. Then subtract 732* something. 4958 - 732*5 = 4958 - 3660 = 1298. Still way off. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 732 - (67 * something). Let's say 67 * 10 = 670. 732 - 670 = 62. Then 62 * 74 = 4588. No. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe 74 * 12 is 888, which is close to 900. How to get 12 from the remaining numbers. 27 - (732/67). Let's calculate 732 divided by 67. 67*10=670, 67*11=737, so 732 is 67*10 + 62. So 10 + 62/67 ≈10.925. So 27 -10.925≈16.075. Not 12. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, 732 divided by 67. Let's calculate that exactly. 67*10=670, 732-670=62. So 10 + 62/67 ≈10.925. Then 74 - 27 =47. 47 *10.925≈47*10 +47*0.925≈470 +43.475≈513.475. Not 900.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to think differently. Let's see what combinations can get to 900. For example, 900 divided by 27 is approximately 33.33. So if I can get 33.33 from the remaining numbers (732,74,67), that might work. But how?\n\nAlternatively, 900 divided by 74 is about 12.16. Maybe 12.16 times 74 =900. But how to get 12.16 from the other numbers. 732 divided by 67 is about 10.925. 10.925 + something? 10.925 + 27/74=10.925 +0.364≈11.29. Not 12.16.\n\nWait, maybe (732 - 67) * (74 / 27). Let's compute: 732 -67=665. 74/27≈2.7407. Then 665 * 2.7407≈665*2=1330, 665*0.7407≈492. So total ≈1822. Way over.\n\nAlternatively, (732 + 67) =799. Then multiply by something. 799 * (74/27). 74/27≈2.7407. 799*2.7407≈800*2.74=2192, which is way over.\n\nHmm. Maybe subtraction. Let's think of 732 + 74 = 806. Then 806 + 67=873. Then 873 +27=900. Wait! Oh! Wait, that uses all numbers: 732 +74 +67 +27= 732+74=806, 806+67=873, 873+27=900. But does that use each number once and all of them? Yes! 27,732,67,74. But wait, adding them all up. Let me check the sum:\n\n27 + 732 = 759\n\n759 +67=826\n\n826 +74=900.\n\nYes! That's it! But wait, the problem says \"using basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) one or multiple times but each number can only be used once, and you must use all the numbers.\" So adding all four numbers together: 27 + 732 + 67 +74 = 900. That works. But is this allowed? Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nThe user says: create an equation that equals 900 using all the numbers, each once, with basic operations. So if adding all four numbers gives 900, then that's acceptable. But wait, let's verify the sum.\n\n27 + 732 is 759. Then +67 is 826. Then +74 is 900. Exactly. So the equation would be 27 + 732 + 67 +74 = 900. But since each number is used once and all are used, and only addition, which is allowed. But maybe I need to check if the numbers are 27, 732,67,74. Let me add them again:\n\n27+732=759, 759+67=826, 826+74=900. Correct. So this works. But maybe the user expects a combination with different operations, but since the sum works, that's valid.\n\nBut wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check the numbers again. 27,732,67,74. Adding all:\n\n27 + 732 = 759\n\n759 +67 = 826\n\n826 +74=900. Yes, correct. So the equation is simply 27 + 732 + 67 +74 = 900. But that seems too straightforward. Maybe the problem expects using more operations, but according to the instructions, addition is allowed. So perhaps the answer is that.\n</think>\n\n<answer>27 + 732 + 67 + 74 = 900</answer>"}]}

Wait, 425 is less than 463, so subtracting would make it smaller. That's not helpful. Maybe add something to 425 instead. Let's see: 463 - 425 = 38. So I need to make 38 using the remaining numbers: 85, 56, 9. But wait, 85 and 56 are both larger than 38. Maybe subtract? Let's see. 85 - 56 = 29. Then 29 + 9 = 38. Oh, that works! So combining those steps: 425 + (85 - 56 + 9) = 425 + 38 = 463. Let me check:\n\n85 - 56 = 29. Then 29 + 9 = 38. Add that to 425: 425 + 38 = 463. Yes! But wait, the operations need to use all numbers. Let me confirm: 425 is used, 85, 56, 9 are all used once. So the equation would be 425 + 85 - 56 + 9.

Let's see. Hmm, 339 is the target. Let me think about possible combinations.\n\nFirst, maybe start by looking for operations that can get close. Let's see, 41 is a big number. If I multiply 41 by something. Let's try 41*8.25 is 339.25, which is close to 339. How can I get 8.25 from the remaining numbers 22, 17, 6? 22 divided by (something). 22 divided by 2.666 is about 8.25. Wait, 2.666 is 8/3. Maybe 6 and 17. 17 minus 6 is 11. 22 divided by 11 is 2. So 22/(17-6) = 22/11 = 2. Then 41*2 = 82, which is way too low. Hmm, not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe if I do 41*(22 - (17-6)). Let's calculate that: 17-6=11, 22-11=11, 41*11=451. That's over.\n\nAlternatively, 41 + 22 = 63. 63* something. 339 divided by 63 is about 5.38. Maybe 17 and 6. 17 - 6 = 11. Doesn't help. 17/6 is about 2.83. So 63*(17/6) = 63*(2.833...) ≈ 178.5. Not close.\n\nWhat if I subtract numbers first. 41 - 17 = 24. Then 24*22 = 528. Then 528 - 6 = 522. Still not 339.\n\nWait, 41*17 is 697. That's way too big. Maybe 41* (something). Let's see 339 divided by 41 is approximately 8.268. So if I can make 8.268 from 22,17,6. Let's see. Maybe 22 - (17 -6) = 22 -11=11. No. Or 22/(17 -6) = 2. So 41*2=82. Not 339. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 17*22 is 374. 374 -41=333. Then 333 +6=339. Wait, that's 17*22 -41 +6. Let me check: 17*22=374. 374-41=333. 333+6=339. But does that use all numbers once? Yes: 17,22,41,6. All used. Oh! That works. Let me verify:\n\n17 * 22 = 374\n\n374 - 41 = 333\n\n333 + 6 = 339\n\nYes! So the equation is (17 × 22) - 41 + 6 = 339.

For example, if two numbers can be divided to get 1, but the numbers here are 15, 76, 7, 98. Let me check if any of these are factors of each other. 98 divided by 7 is 14. Oh, that's close. 76 divided by 76 is 1, but I can't use 76 twice. So maybe that's not helpful. 15 divided by 15 is 1, same problem.\n\nWait, but perhaps combining operations. Like, if I subtract two numbers to get zero, then maybe divide or multiply with others. Let me try. For example, 98 - 76 = 22. Then 22 combined with 15 and 7. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, 98 - 7 = 91. Then 91 and 76, maybe? Still not leading me to 1.\n\nAnother approach: maybe fractions. For example, (15/7) is around 2.14. Then 76 minus that... Not sure. Or 76 divided by something. Let's see, 76 divided by (98 - 15*7). Wait, 15*7 is 105. 98 -105 is -7. So 76 / (-7) is about -10.857. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe using division and multiplication together. Let's see. For example, (98 / 7) = 14. Then 14 - 15 = -1. Then combine with 76. Maybe -1 + 76 = 75. Not 1. Alternatively, (76 - (98/7)) = 76 -14=62. Then 62 -15=47. No.\n\nWait, what if I do (15 - (98 / 7))? That's 15 -14=1. Then I have 76 left. But how to use 76 to get from 1 to 1? Maybe multiply by (76 -76) but that's using 76 twice. Hmm. Wait, maybe (15 - (98/7)) + (76 -76) but again, duplicates. Not allowed.\n\nWait, but I need to use all four numbers. So, if I have 15, 76,7,98. Let me try (98 / 7) =14. Then 15 -14=1. Now I have 76 left. How to include 76? Maybe 1 * (76 -76) but again, duplicate. No. Alternatively, 76 divided by something. Wait, 76 divided by 76 is 1. But again, duplicate. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (98 - 76) =22. Then 22 / (15 - 7) =22/8=2.75. Not 1. Or 15 -7=8. Then 98 -76=22. Then 22/8=2.75. No.\n\nWait, 76 divided by (something). Let's see. 76 divided by (15 +7) =76/22≈3.454. Then 98 minus that? 98 -3.454≈94.546. Not helpful.\n\nWhat about (98 -76) divided by (15 -7)? That's 22 /8=2.75. Still no.\n\nAlternatively, 7 divided by 7 is 1, but again duplicate. Or 15 divided by 15. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe using multiplication and division. For example, 15 * 7 =105. Then 98 -76=22. Then 105 -22=83. Not 1.\n\nAlternatively, 76 - (98 -15)=76 -83=-7. Then -7 +7=0. No. Wait, but that uses 7 twice? Or wait, if I do 76 - (98 -15) =76-83=-7, then add 7? That would be -7 +7=0. But that uses 7 once, right? Let's see: 76, 98,15,7. So 76 - (98 -15) =76 -83= -7. Then -7 +7=0. But that uses all four numbers? Wait: 98,15,76,7. So yes: (76 - (98 -15)) +7 = (76-83)+7=(-7)+7=0.

Still no.\n\nWhat if I do 76/(98 -15 -7)? Let's calculate denominator: 98-15=83, 83-7=76. So 76/(76)=1. Oh! Wait, that's possible. Let me check:\n\n76 divided by (98 -15 -7).

I need to use all the numbers 80, 36, 1, and 74 exactly once each with basic operations to make 190. Hmm. Let me start by thinking about how these numbers can combine. \n\nFirst, 80 is a pretty big number. Maybe I can use that as a starting point. If I subtract something from 80 to get close to 190, wait, 80 is smaller than 190. So maybe I need to multiply. Let's see. If I can multiply 80 by something. The other numbers are 36, 1, 74. 80 multiplied by 2 would be 160, but how do I get a 2 from the remaining numbers? Let me check if that's possible. 36, 1, 74. Hmm, 74 divided by 36 is about 2.055... but that's not an integer. Maybe 36 minus 1 is 35, but 35 plus 74 is 109. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe adding 80 and 74 would give 154. Then I need another 36 to get to 190. But wait, 154 + 36 is 190. But I have to use all the numbers. So 80 + 74 + 36 would be 190, but that uses three numbers and leaves out 1. How can I include 1? Maybe subtract 1? But 80 +74 +36 -1 = 189. That's one less. Not helpful. Alternatively, if I can find a way to use the 1 in a multiplication or division that would adjust the total.\n\nWait, maybe I can multiply 36 by something. Let's see. If I do 80 plus (36 * something) plus or minus the other numbers. Let's try 36*5=180. Then 180 + 80 = 260. That's way over. Hmm. Or maybe 36 divided by something. 36/1 is 36. So 80 +74 +36 = 190, but again, that uses three numbers. Wait, but the 1 is left. How to use it?\n\nWait, the problem says you have to use all four numbers. So I can't leave out the 1. So maybe the equation is something like 80 + 74 + 36 - 1* something. Wait, but 1 has to be used once. So perhaps 80 + 74 + (36 / 1) = 80 +74 +36 = 190? Wait, 80 +74 is 154, 154 +36 is 190. But then using 36 divided by 1 gives 36, so yes. So that would be 80 +74 + (36 /1). Then all numbers are used: 80, 74, 36, 1. Let me check: 36 divided by 1 is 36, plus 80 is 116, plus74 is 190. Yes! That works. But wait, the division is of 36 by 1. So the equation would be 80 + 74 + (36 / 1) = 190. But maybe the parentheses are not necessary. Let me verify:\n\n80 + 74 + 36 / 1. Since division has higher precedence, 36/1 is 36, so 80+74=154, plus 36 is 190. Yes. So that works. But is this the correct approach? Let me just check if all numbers are used once: 80, 74, 36, 1. Yes. And operations are +, +, /.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"using basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) one or multiple times but each number can only be used once, and you must use all the numbers.\" So this seems to satisfy all conditions. So the equation is 80 + 74 + 36 / 1 = 190. Alternatively, maybe written with parentheses for clarity: (80 + 74) + (36 / 1) = 190. Either way, that uses all numbers once. \n\nBut let me see if there are other possibilities. Maybe using subtraction or multiplication. For example, 74 * something. 74 * 2 is 148. Then 148 + 36 = 184, plus 80 is 264. Too big. Alternatively, 80 * 2 = 160, then 160 +36=196. That's over. Maybe subtract something. 80*2 -74 = 160-74=86. Not helpful. \n\nAnother approach: 80 + (36 * something) +74 -1. Let's see, if 36 * something. Let's see 36*3=108. 80+108=188, plus74=262, minus1=261. No. 36*5=180. 80+180=260, plus74=334. No. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, 74 + 36 = 110. Then 110 * something. 110 * 1 =110. 80 + 110 =190. Oh, wait! So 80 + (74 +36) *1 = 190. Wait, that would be 80 + 110 *1. But multiplication comes before addition, so that's 80 + (110*1) = 80 +110=190. So equation is 80 + (74 +36) *1. Let me check: 74+36=110, times 1=110, plus 80=190. Yes. And all numbers used: 80,74,36,1. So that's another possible equation. So either way, but which one is correct. \n\nWait, in that case, the equation would be 80 + (74 +36)*1. But parentheses are necessary to ensure that addition is done first. Otherwise, without parentheses, it's 80 +74 +36*1, which is same as 80+74+36=190, same as the first approach. So maybe both equations are equivalent. But perhaps the second one uses multiplication, which is a different approach.\n\nSo either equation would work. But which one is simpler. The first one is straightforward. The second one involves adding parentheses. Either is acceptable. Let me check both.\n\nFirst approach: 80 + 74 + 36 /1 =190. Second approach: 80 + (74 +36) *1 =190. Both are correct. But maybe the first one uses division, and the second uses multiplication. Either way, they both use all numbers once. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way. Let me see. For example, 80 * (something) - something. Let's try 80*(36/ (74-1)). Wait, 74-1=73. 36/73 is about 0.493. 80*0.493≈39.45. That's way under. Not helpful. \n\nAnother idea: 74*3=222. 222 -32=190. But where to get 32? Hmm. If I use 80 and 36 and 1. 80 -36=44. 44-12=32. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, 36 - (80 / something). Wait, 80 divided by something. 80/5=16. But I don't have a 5. Maybe 80/(something). Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe 74*2 + 80 -36 +1. Let's check: 74*2=148, +80=228, -36=192, +1=193. No. 74*2 +80=228. 228 -36=192, -1=191. Not 190. Close. \n\nAlternatively, 80 +36=116. 116*1=116. 116 +74=190. So 80 +36 +74 =190, but that's using three numbers again. Wait, but we can include the 1 as a multiplier. So (80 +36) *1 +74=190. But that's 116*1 +74=190. So that's another way. So equation: (80 +36) *1 +74 =190. But that uses all numbers. Let's check: 80+36=116, *1=116, +74=190. Yes. So that's another valid equation. \n\nSo there are multiple possibilities. But according to the problem statement, any equation that uses all numbers once with basic operations is acceptable. So perhaps the simplest is 80 +74 +36 /1 =190. Or 80 + (74 +36) *1. Both are valid. So I can present either. Let me verify again:\n\nFor 80 +74 +36 /1: the division is done first, so 36/1=36. Then 80+74=154, +36=190. Correct.\n\nFor (74 +36) *1 +80: same result. \n\nAlternatively, 80 +36 *1 +74: same as 80 +36 +74=190. But with 36 multiplied by 1. So 36*1=36. So the equation is 80 + (36 *1) +74. Which also works. \n\nSo all these are valid. The key is to use each number exactly once. So whichever way I present, as long as all numbers are used. So the answer could be one of these. \n\nBut perhaps the simplest is 80 +74 +36 ÷1 =190. Or using parentheses to make it clearer. But in terms of minimal operations, maybe the first one is better.\n</think>\n\n<answer>80 + 74 + 36 / 1 = 190</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using all the numbers 98, 47, 878, and 11 exactly once, with basic arithmetic operations, and the result should be 838. Hmm, tricky. Let me start by thinking about the target number 838. Maybe I can see how close I can get with some combinations.\n\nFirst, let's look at the largest number here, which is 878. If I subtract something from 878 to get close to 838, that difference would need to be 40. Wait, 878 - 40 = 838. So maybe if I can make 40 using the remaining numbers 98, 47, and 11. Wait, but I have to use all numbers, so maybe that's a path.\n\nWait, but the remaining numbers are 98, 47, and 11. Let's see: 98 - 47 is 51, then 51 - 11 is 40. So 878 - (98 -47 -11) = 878 - (40) = 838. Wait, but that would be 98 -47 -11 = 40, right? Then 878 -40=838. But does that use all numbers? Let's check: 878, 98,47,11. Yes, each is used once. So the equation would be 878 - (98 -47 -11) = 838. Let me verify that:\n\n98 -47 =51, 51-11=40. 878-40=838. Yes, that works. So the equation is 878 - 98 +47 +11. Wait, because subtracting (98 -47 -11) is the same as subtracting 98, then adding 47 and 11. Let me check: 878 -98 +47 +11. Let's compute step by step:\n\n878 -98 = 780. 780 +47=827. 827 +11=838. Yes! So the equation is 878 -98 +47 +11 =838. But wait, does this use all numbers? 878,98,47,11. Yes, each once. And all operations are subtraction and addition. So that works. Let me check again to be sure. \n\nAlternatively, another way to write it might be 878 - (98 - (47 +11)), but that would be 47 +11=58, then 98-58=40, then 878-40=838. But that's the same as before. So either way, the equation uses all numbers once. So the answer would be 878 -98 +47 +11. So putting that in parentheses as needed. Wait, maybe the equation can be written as (878 - 98) + (47 + 11). Let's compute that: 780 +58=838. That also works. So either way. But since the problem allows any arrangement as long as all numbers are used once, perhaps the simplest is 878 - 98 +47 +11. Let me check once more:\n\n878 -98 is 780. Then 780 +47 is 827, then +11 gives 838. Perfect. So the equation is 878 - 98 +47 +11 =838. So that's using all four numbers with subtraction and addition. I think that's the solution.\n</think>\n\n<answer>878 - 98 + 47 + 11 = 838</answer>"}]}

I need to use the numbers 30, 53, 1, and 73 exactly once each, with basic arithmetic operations to make 156. Hmm. Let me start by thinking about how these numbers can combine. Since 156 is a relatively large number, maybe multiplication is involved. Let's check the possible products first.\n\nLooking at 53 and 30: 53*30 is 1590, which is way too big. Maybe 73 is a key here. 73*2 would be 146, which is close to 156. But how to get 2 from the remaining numbers? Wait, the remaining numbers are 53, 30, 1. If I subtract 53 - 30 = 23, which isn't helpful. Alternatively, 30 - 53 is negative, which complicates things. Maybe adding or subtracting 1 somewhere.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 73 + 53 = 126. Then I need 30 more. But 126 + 30 is 156, but then I still have the 1 left. Oh, but I have to use all numbers. So that approach might not work unless I can incorporate the 1 into the equation somehow. For example, 73 + 53 + 30 = 156, but that uses three numbers and leaves out 1. So that's a problem because we have to use all four numbers.\n\nHmm. Maybe using division or subtraction to adjust. Let's think differently. What if I do 73 * (something) to get 156. Let's see: 156 divided by 73 is approximately 2.137. Not a whole number, so maybe not. Alternatively, 156 divided by 30 is 5.2. Not helpful. 156 divided by 53 is around 2.94. Still not a whole number.\n\nWait, maybe combining operations. Let's see. If I subtract two numbers and multiply by another. For example, (73 - 53) = 20. Then 20 * (30 - 1) = 20*29 = 580. That's too big. Alternatively, (73 - 1) =72, 72 * (something). Let's see. 72*2=144, which is 12 less than 156. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 53 * 3 =159. Close to 156. If I could get 3 from the other numbers. 30 / (73 - something). Wait, 73 -1=72, then 30 /72=0.416..., which doesn't help. Maybe 53 * (something). Let's see: 53*2=106, then 156 -106=50. How to get 50 from 73, 30, 1? 73 -30=43, 43+1=44. Not 50. Hmm.\n\nAnother angle: 30 * 5 =150. Then 150 +6=156. How to get 5 and 6 from the remaining numbers? 53,1,73. Let's see, 53 - (73 / something). 73 divided by 1 is 73. 53 -73= -20. Not helpful. Alternatively, 53 +1=54, then 54 - something. But 54 -73= -19. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe using division. Like 73 divided by something. 73/1=73. Then 73 +53=126, 126 +30=156. But that uses 73,1,53,30. Wait, that's all four numbers! Wait, 73 divided by 1 is 73, then 73 +53=126, 126 +30=156. But that would be 73/1 +53 +30=156. Let me check that: 73/1=73, 73+53=126, 126+30=156. Yes! That uses all four numbers: 73 divided by 1, then plus 53 and 30. But wait, are all operations allowed? The problem says we can use the operations multiple times but each number once. Let's check: numbers used are 73,1,53,30. Each once. Operations used are division, addition, addition. So that's acceptable. So the equation would be (73 / 1) + 53 + 30 =156. Let me compute: 73 divided by 1 is 73, plus 53 is 126, plus 30 is 156. Yes! That works.

Hmm, let's see. \n\nFirst, I should note that 649 is a relatively large number, so maybe multiplication will be involved here. Let me start by looking at the bigger numbers in the list: 254 and 312. If I can combine those in a way that gets close to 649, then maybe adjust with the smaller numbers. \n\nLet me check what 254 + 312 equals. That's 254 + 312 = 566. Hmm, that's less than 649. So maybe adding another number here. But I have to use all four numbers. Wait, 254 and 312 are two of them, so I need to involve 20 and 63 somehow. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps multiplying some of them. Let's try 254 * 3. That would be 762, which is higher than 649. But where would I get 3 from? Maybe 63 divided by 21, but 21 isn't one of the numbers. Alternatively, 312 divided by something. Let's see, 312 divided by 12 is 26, but again, not helpful. \n\nWait, maybe 312 - 254 = 58. Then 58 * something. 58 * 11 is 638, close to 649. How to get 11? 63 - 52 = 11, but I don't have 52. Alternatively, 20 - 9 = 11, but no 9. Hmm. \n\nAnother approach: Let's see what 63 * 10 is 630. Adding 20 gives 650, which is very close to 649. But how to get 10 from the remaining numbers. Wait, 254 and 312. If I can get 254 - 312 to get -58, but not helpful. Alternatively, 312 - 254 = 58. Then 58 divided by something. 58 divided by 5.8 is 10, but 5.8 isn't available. Wait, 63 - (something) = 10? 63 - 53 = 10, but again, not directly. \n\nAlternatively, maybe 63 * (20 - something) = ? Let me think. If I do 63 * 10 = 630, which is close. But how to get 10. Maybe (312 - 254) / 5.8, but no. Alternatively, 20 - (something) to make 10.5, which would give 63 * 10.5 = 661.5. Not helpful. \n\nWait, let's try another angle. 254 + 312 = 566. Then 566 + 63 = 629, which is 20 less than 649. So 629 + 20 = 649. Wait, but that would be 254 + 312 + 63 + 20. But that's just adding all of them together. Let me check: 254 + 312 is 566, plus 63 is 629, plus 20 is 649. Wait, that's exactly 649! But wait, that's just using all numbers with addition. So 254 + 312 + 63 + 20 = 649. Let me add that up again to confirm.\n\n254 + 312: 200+300=500, 54+12=66, total 566. Then 566 +63: 566+60=626, +3=629. Then 629 +20=649. Yes, that works. But wait, the problem says you can use the arithmetic operations one or multiple times. So if the answer is just adding them all together, that's allowed? Let me check the original problem statement again.\n\n\"Using the numbers 20, 63, 254, 312, create an equation that equals 649. You can use basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) one or multiple times but each number can only be used once, and you must use all the numbers.\"\n\nSo in this case, if I use all four numbers with addition, that's allowed. The operations can be used multiple times, but here we use only addition three times. But the user might have expected a more complex equation. But according to the problem statement, it's acceptable. Let me check if that's correct.\n\nYes, 20 + 63 + 254 + 312 = 649. Let me add them again step by step. 20 + 63 is 83. 83 + 254 is 337. 337 + 312 is 649. Yes, that's correct. So maybe the answer is simply adding all the numbers. But wait, I need to make sure that the user didn't have a trick in mind where you have to use different operations. But according to the problem statement, addition is allowed. \n\nWait, but maybe I miscalculated. Let me check each step again. 20 + 63 is 83. Then 83 + 254: 83 + 200 is 283, +54 is 337. Then 337 + 312: 300 + 300 is 600, 37 +12 is 49, so total 649. Correct. So the equation is just 20 + 63 + 254 + 312 = 649. But perhaps the problem expects using more operations. Let me think again. Maybe there's another way, but if this straightforward way works, then that's the answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem had a typo, but according to the numbers given, adding them all up gives exactly 649. So that's the equation. Therefore, the answer is (20 + 63 + 254 + 312) = 649.

Alternatively, maybe 97 * 5 = 485, and then add (87 - 37) which is 50. 485 + 50 = 535, which is too much. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (87 + 5) * something. 87 +5 is 92. 92 * 5 is 460. Not enough.

Hmm.\n\nWait, 97 - (87 / something). Let's try 87 divided by 37. That's approximately 2.35. Then 97 minus 2.35 is about 94.65. Multiply by 5 is 473.25. Still not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 87 * 5 is 435. Then adding 97 gives 532. Then subtract 37 is 495. Wait, that works! Let's check:\n\n87 * 5 = 435. Then 435 + 97 = 532. Then 532 - 37 = 495.

Maybe subtract that from 850? 850 -84.5 is 765.5. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe I can get 13 by 66 - (90/12). Let's compute that. 90 divided by 12 is 7.5, so 66 -7.5 is 58.5. Still not 13. Hmm. Maybe 12 divided by something. 12 divided by something else... but I need to use all numbers. Let me think differently.\n\nPerhaps instead of adding to 850, maybe subtract something from 850. 850 minus what would get close to 863? Wait, that's not possible since 850 is less than 863. So adding to 850 is better. Let's see. What if I take 850 + (90 - 66) +12? Let's compute that. 90-66 is 24, then 24 +12 is 36. 850 +36 is 886. That's too high. Not 863. \n\nAlternatively, maybe 850 + 90 - (66 +12). Let's calculate: 66 +12 is 78. 850 +90 is 940, minus 78 is 862. Oh! That's 862, just one less than 863. Close. Hmm. If I could somehow adjust that by 1. But how? Let's check the operations again. Wait, 850 +90 = 940. Then 66 +12 =78. 940 -78=862. So close. Maybe rearrange the operations. What if I do 850 + (90 - (66 -12))? Let's see: 66-12 is 54. 90 -54 is 36. 850 +36 is 886. Still not. \n\nAlternatively, 850 + (90 -66) -12. That's 24 -12=12. 850+12=862. Again, 862. Still missing 1. Hmm. Maybe there's a different approach. Let's think about multiplication or division. Let's see. Maybe 850 plus (something multiplied or divided by another number). For example, 90 divided by 12 is 7.5. 850 +7.5=857.5. Then adding 66 would be 923.5, which is way over. Not helpful. \n\nWhat if we do 90 * something. Let's see. 90*12=1080. If we subtract that from 850, 850-1080= -230. Then adding 66 would be -164. Not useful. \n\nAlternatively, 90 * 66 = 5940. That's way too big. 5940 divided by 12 is 495. Then 850 -495=355. Not helpful. \n\nHow about 66 *12=792. 850 -792=58. Then 58 +90=148. Not 863. \n\nWait, maybe 850 plus (66 - (90/12)). Let's compute that: 90/12 is 7.5. 66 -7.5=58.5. 850 +58.5=908.5. Still not. \n\nAlternatively, 850 + (66 * something). Let's see. 66*12=792. 850+792=1642. That's way over. \n\nHmm. Maybe subtract something from 850 and then add others. Let's think: 850 - something + other numbers =863. So 850 - x + y + z =863. Where x, y, z are 90,66,12 in some combination. Then, rearranged, -x + y + z = 13. So y + z -x =13. Let's see. Let's see possible combinations. Let's take x as one of the numbers, y and z as the other two. So:\n\nIf x=90, then y+z=103. But the other numbers are 66 and12, which sum to 78. Not 103. Doesn't work.\n\nIf x=66, then y+z=13+66=79. The remaining numbers are 90 and12. 90+12=102. Not 79. Alternatively, maybe subtraction between y and z. Wait, but the original equation would be y + z -x =13, where x is 66. So y + z =79. But 90 and12 sum to 102. No. What if instead of adding, there's a different operation. Wait, but in the equation, it's y + z -x, so y and z are being added. So that's not possible. \n\nIf x=12, then y+z=13+12=25. The remaining numbers are 90 and66. 90+66=156. 156 is way higher than 25. So no. So that approach might not work. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a division involved. Let's see. Let's think of 850 plus something divided by something else. For example, 850 + (90 / (66-12)). Let's compute denominator:66-12=54. 90/54≈1.666. So 850 +1.666≈851.666. Not helpful. \n\nOr maybe 850 + (66/(90-12)). 90-12=78. 66/78≈0.846. 850 +0.846≈850.846. Not helpful. \n\nWait, maybe 850 plus (90 - (66/12)). Let's compute 66/12=5.5. 90-5.5=84.5. 850+84.5=934.5. Still too high. \n\nAlternatively, 850 plus (90 -66) times 12. 90-66=24. 24*12=288. 850+288=1138. No. \n\nHmm. Let's think differently. Maybe start with 12 and 66. Let's see, 66 +12=78. 850 +78=928. Then subtract 90? 928-90=838. Not 863. \n\nAlternatively, 850 -12=838. Then add 66 and 90. 66+90=156. 838+156=994. No. \n\nWait, maybe multiply. For example, 90*12=1080. Then 1080 -66=1014. 1014-850=164. Not helpful. \n\nWhat if we do 850 +90=940. Then 940 -66=874. 874 -12=862. Again, 862. So close. How can we get that extra 1? Wait, maybe use division in a way to get a fraction. For example, if instead of 850 +90 -66 -12, which gives 862, maybe we can replace one of the minuses with a division that adds a fraction. Let's see. For example, 850 +90 - (66/12). Let's compute 66/12=5.5. So 850+90=940. 940 -5.5=934.5. Not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, 850 + (90 -66) - (12/x). Wait, but we need to use 12. So maybe 12 divided by something else. But all numbers must be used. So if we do 850 + (90 -66) - (12/something), but we've already used 90,66,12, and 850. So there's no other number left. So maybe that's not possible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe use a combination like 850 + (90 / (66 -12)). Let's compute denominator:66-12=54. 90/54≈1.666. 850 +1.666≈851.666. Not useful. \n\nWait, what if we multiply 66 by something. Let's see. 66*12=792. Then 850 -792=58. Then 58 +90=148. Not 863. \n\nHmm. Maybe a different approach. Let's try to build 863 using all numbers. Let's see, 863 is 850 +13. So we need to make 13 from 90, 66, and 12. Let's see. 90 -66=24. 24 -12=12. Not 13. 66 - (90/12). 90/12=7.5, 66-7.5=58.5. No. 90 - (66 +12)=90-78=12. Still 12. \n\nAlternatively, (90 +66)/12=156/12=13. Oh! Wait, (90 +66)/12=156/12=13. That's exactly 13! Then, 850 +13=863. But let's check if we can use all numbers here. So 850 + (90 +66)/12. Let's see. The operations: 90 and 66 are added, then divided by 12, and then added to 850. But we have to use all numbers once. So that uses 90,66,12, and 850. Perfect! So the equation would be 850 + (90 +66)/12 = 850 + (156)/12 = 850 +13 =863. That works! Let me verify again:\n\n90 +66 =156\n\n156 /12=13\n\n850 +13=863. Yes! All numbers are used exactly once. So the equation is 850 + (90 +66)/12 =863.\n</think>\n\n<answer>850 + (90 + 66) / 12</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using the numbers 31, 75, 12, and 1 exactly once each, with basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) to reach 447. Hmm, 447 is a pretty big number, so maybe multiplication will be involved here. Let me start by thinking about how to combine these numbers to get close to 447.\n\nFirst, let's look at the largest numbers available. 75 is the biggest, followed by 31. If I multiply 75 by something, maybe that will get me close. 75 multiplied by 6 is 450, which is just 3 more than 447. Wait, 75*6 = 450, so 450 - 3 = 447. But do I have a 3? Well, I have 12 and 1. If I can get 3 from 12 and 1, that might work. But 12 divided by something... 12 divided by 4 is 3, but I don't have a 4. Alternatively, 12 - 9 = 3, but again, no 9. Hmm, maybe that's not the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 75*5 = 375. Then I need 72 more. But 31 + 12 + 1 = 44, which is way less. So not helpful. Let me try a different approach. What if I subtract something from 75*6 to get 447? Wait, 75*6 is 450, so 450 - 3 = 447. How can I get 3 from the remaining numbers? The remaining numbers would be 31, 12, and 1. Wait, but 31 is already used? No, wait, the idea was to use 75 multiplied by something, then subtract 3. But I need to use all numbers once. So 31, 12, 1 must be part of the equation. Let me think again.\n\nLet me try combining 31 and 12 first. 31*12 = 372. Then adding 75 would get me 372 +75 = 447. Oh, wait! 31*12 = 372, then 372 +75 = 447. Then what about the 1? Oh, wait, but I have to use all numbers. So I have to include the 1 somewhere. Hmm. So that approach uses 31,12,75 but leaves out 1. So that's not acceptable. So maybe need to adjust that.\n\nWait, maybe 31*12 = 372, then 372 + (75 +1) = 372 +76 = 448, which is one more than needed. Close, but not 447. Alternatively, 372 +75 -1 = 447 -1 = 446? No, that's 372+75=447, then 447-1=446. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (75 -1) * something. Let's see, 75-1=74. 74*6=444, which is close to 447. Then 444 +3=447. Again, where to get the 3 from 12 and 31. Wait, but 31 and 12. 12 divided by (31 - something). Maybe 12/(31 - something). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 75* (12 -1). Let's calculate that: 12-1=11. 75*11=825. Then subtract 31. 825 -31=794. That's way over. Not helpful.\n\nWhat if we do 75*5.96? But that's not helpful with integers. Hmm. Maybe trying division. For example, 75/1 =75. Then multiply by 12: 75*12=900. Then subtract 31: 900-31=869. Still way too high.\n\nWait, 75*6=450, which is close to 447. So 450 -3=447. How can I get 3 from the remaining numbers: 31, 12, 1. Let's see. 12 / (31 -1) = 12/30 = 0.4. Not 3. Alternatively, 31 - (12 +1) =18. Not 3. Alternatively, 12 - (31 -1) =12-30= -18. No. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe 75* (something involving 31 and 12 and 1) =447. Let's see. For example, 75 + 31 = 106. Then 106*4.216... but that's not helpful. Maybe 75 + (31 * 12) = 75 +372=447. Then where does the 1 go? Oh, but again, that uses 31,12,75, and leaves out 1. So need to include 1 somehow.\n\nWait, maybe use division with the 1. For example, (31 *12) + (75 /1) = 372 +75=447. But then that uses 31,12,75,1. Wait! That's all four numbers! Because 75 divided by 1 is 75. So 31*12 +75/1. Let me check: 31*12 is 372, 75/1 is 75. 372+75=447. Yes! That works. All numbers are used once: 31, 12, 75, and 1. The operations are multiplication, division, and addition. Perfect.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that each number is used exactly once. 31 is multiplied by 12, 75 is divided by 1, so yes: 31,12,75,1 all used. Operations: * , / , +. So that's allowed. So the equation is (31 * 12) + (75 / 1) = 447. But I can write it without the parentheses if the order of operations holds. But to be safe, maybe include parentheses. Let me check: 31*12=372, 75/1=75. 372+75=447. Exactly. So that's the answer.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(31 * 12) + (75 / 1) = 447</answer>"}]}

Maybe multiplying them with something? Let's see. If I multiply 100 by 97, that's 9700, which is way too big. But maybe if I can divide that by something. Wait, 9700 divided by 10 would be 970, but I don't have a 10. Wait, but I do have 20 and 2. Maybe 20 divided by 2 is 10. Oh, that's a thought. So 100 * 97 / (20 / 2). Let me check that. 20 divided by 2 is 10, then 100 times 97 is 9700, divided by 10 gives 970. That works! Let me make sure I used all numbers once. 100, 97, 20, and 2. Yes, all used.

Each number has to be used exactly once, and the result should be 785. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, I should look at the target number, 785. Let me think about what operations could get me there. Maybe addition and subtraction? Let's check the numbers. The largest number here is 729. If I subtract something from 729, maybe that could get close. 729 minus, let's see... 729 minus what would get me near 785? Wait, 729 is less than 785, so subtracting from it would make it smaller. That's not helpful. So maybe I need to add 729 to something else, but 729 is already quite big. Adding 729 to 71 gives 800, which is higher than 785. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe combining some of the smaller numbers first. Let's see: 88 is a two-digit number. If I can pair 88 with another number through multiplication or division. For example, 88 times 9 is 792, but I don't have a 9. Wait, but 729 is 9^3, so maybe that's a clue. But 729 divided by something? Let's see. 729 divided by 9 is 81, but I don't have a 9. Alternatively, 729 divided by 3 is 243, but again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 39. If I take 39 and multiply it by something. 39 times 20 is 780, which is close to 785. So 39 times 20 plus 5 would be 785. But how do I get 20 and 5 from the remaining numbers? The remaining numbers would be 71, 729, and 88. Hmm. Not sure.\n\nWait, let's try combining 71 and 88. 71 + 88 is 159. Then 39 multiplied by something. 39*20 is 780, so 159 minus something equals 20? That doesn't seem right. Or maybe 39 times (71 + 88) would be 39*159, which is way too big.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe 729 minus a combination of the other numbers. Let's see. 729 + something = 785. Then that something would be 56. But do I have numbers that can add up to 56? The remaining numbers are 39, 71, and 88. 88 - 39 is 49, which is close but not 56. 71 - 39 is 32. 88 - 71 is 17. Hmm, not helpful. Wait, 71 - (88 - 39) is 71 - 49 = 22. Not 56. Alternatively, 88 + 39 = 127. 729 + 127 = 856, which is too big. Then 856 minus 71 is 785. Wait, that might work. Let me check: 729 + 88 + 39 = 856. Then 856 - 71 = 785. But wait, that uses all the numbers: 729 + 88 + 39 - 71. Let me compute that:\n\n729 + 88 is 817. 817 + 39 is 856. Then 856 - 71 is 785. Yes! That works. So the equation would be 729 + 88 + 39 - 71 = 785. Let me verify each number is used once: 729, 88, 39, 71. Yep, all used once. And the operations are addition and subtraction.

Hmm. Let me start by thinking about the target number, 341. Let's see what operations could lead there.\n\nFirst, maybe I can try adding some of the larger numbers and see where that gets me. Let's see: 89 + 82 = 171. Then 78 + 92 = 170. Adding those two sums gives 341. Wait, 171 + 170 is exactly 341! But wait, how can I structure that into an equation using each number once and all operations correctly? Because if I do (89 + 82) + (78 + 92) = 341, but does that use each number once? Let me check: 89, 82, 78, 92—all used once. And since addition is commutative, maybe that's allowed. But the problem says to use each number once, and all of them. So that would work. But maybe they want the equation written in a single line without splitting into two separate additions. Let me see. The example given is (1 + 2) / 3, which uses all numbers once. So perhaps the way to write this is (89 + 82) + (78 + 92) = 341. But maybe I can combine them in another way, using different operations to reach the same result. Let me verify.\n\nAlternatively, maybe subtract or multiply. Let's see if there's another way. For example, 92 is the largest number. If I multiply 92 by 3, that's 276. Then I need 65 more to get to 341. But I have 89, 82, 78 left. Not sure. Or 89 multiplied by something. Let's try 89 * 3 = 267, then 341 - 267 = 74. Do I have numbers that can make 74? 82 - 78 = 4. Not helpful. Alternatively, 82 + 78 = 160. Hmm. Maybe that's not the way.\n\nAnother approach: Let's see if using division can help. For example, if I divide 92 by something. 92 / 2 = 46, but I don't have a 2. Wait, but maybe 82 - 78 = 4, so 92 / (82 - 78) = 23. Then 23 * 15 = 345, which is close. Not sure. Or 89 + (92 / (82 - 78)) = 89 + 23 = 112. Then 112 + something. Maybe 82 is left, but 112 + 82 = 194, which is not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, subtract two numbers and add others. Let's try 92 - 78 = 14. Then 14 + 89 = 103. Then 103 + 82 = 185. Not 341. Hmm.\n\nWait, going back to the initial idea, adding all the numbers: 89 + 82 + 78 + 92. Let me calculate that. 89 + 82 is 171. 78 + 92 is 170. 171 + 170 is 341. So the sum of all four numbers is exactly 341. Wait, but each number is used once, and all operations are additions. So the equation would simply be 89 + 82 + 78 + 92 = 341. But is that considered a valid equation here? The problem says to use each number once and all of them, and basic operations. So addition is allowed multiple times. So yes, that should work. But maybe the user expects parentheses, but the example uses them even when unnecessary. Let me check the example given: (1 + 2) / 3. So maybe parentheses are needed even if not required for order of operations. But in this case, just adding all the numbers would require no parentheses. But maybe the answer should be written as (89 + 82) + (78 + 92) = 341. But the actual equation would just be 89 + 82 + 78 + 92 = 341. However, since the example uses parentheses, maybe they want grouping. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects using a combination of operations rather than just all additions. Let me check again the problem statement: \"You can use basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) one or multiple times but each number can only be used once, and you must use all the numbers.\" So using multiple additions is allowed. So adding all four numbers is a valid solution. Let me confirm the sum: 89 + 82 is 171, plus 78 is 249, plus 92 is 341. Yes. So the equation is 89 + 82 + 78 + 92 = 341. But perhaps the problem expects a more creative use of operations. Let me check if there's another way, maybe using subtraction or multiplication.\n\nFor example, 92 * 3 = 276. Then 276 + 89 = 365. Then 365 - (82 - 78) = 365 -4= 361. Not enough. Alternatively, 92*4= 368. But I don't have a 4. Maybe 82 -78=4. Then 92*(82-78)=92*4=368. Then 368 -89= 279. Not 341. Alternatively, 89*4= 356. Then 356 - (92-82) = 356 -10= 346. Close. Then 346 -5=341, but I don't have a 5. Hmm.\n\nAnother idea: 89* (something). Let's see. 89*3=267. 341-267=74. How can I get 74 from 82,78,92. Maybe 82 - (92-78)= 82-14=68. Not 74. Or 78 + (92-82)=78+10=88. No. Alternatively, 92 - 82=10. 78 +10=88. Still not.\n\nWait, maybe 89 + 82 =171. Then 92 -78=14. Then 171 +14=185. Not enough. No.\n\nAlternatively, 89 * 4=356. How to get 4 from 82,78,92. 82-78=4. So 89*(82-78) +92= 89*4 +92= 356 +92=448. Not 341.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, 92 + 89=181. 82* (something). 82*4=328. Then 328 +13=341. How to get 13 from 78? 78/6=13, but 6 isn't present. Maybe 78 - (92/(something)), but not sure. Let's see. 82*4=328. 328 +13=341. To get 13 from 78 and 92. Not obvious.\n\nAlternatively, 82 * 78 is too big: 6396. Not helpful. 89*92=8188. Also way too big.\n\nLet me think again. Since adding all numbers works, maybe that's the intended solution. Let me check the sum again: 89 +82 is 171. 171 +78 is 249. 249 +92 is 341. Yes. So the equation is simply 89 + 82 + 78 + 92 = 341. Is that acceptable? The problem allows using operations multiple times, and each number once. So yes. The example given uses parentheses, but maybe the answer here doesn't need them. The example's answer was (1+2)/3, but in this case, perhaps the answer is just the numbers added together. Let me see if that's allowed. The problem doesn't specify that operations have to be mixed, just that you can use them. So adding all numbers is a valid solution. Therefore, the equation is 89 + 82 + 78 + 92 = 341.\n</think>\n\n<answer>89 + 82 + 78 + 92 = 341</answer>"}]}

Each number can only be used once, and I can use basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division. Hmm. Let me start by thinking about possible combinations.\n\nFirst, maybe subtract some numbers. If I take the largest numbers, 85 and 82, their difference is 3. That's small. Then I have 29 and 39 left. Wait, 3 plus 29 is 32, which is way less than 71. Not helpful. What if I subtract in a different way?\n\nAlternatively, maybe multiply or divide. Let's see. 85 divided by something? 85 divided by 29 is about 2.93, but not sure how that helps. If I take 82 minus 29, that's 53. Then 85 minus 39 is 46. Hmm, 53 + 46 is 99. Not 71. Maybe not.\n\nWait, 39 and 29. 39 minus 29 is 10. Then 85 minus 10 is 75, but that leaves 82. Not sure. Alternatively, 82 minus (something). Let's think: 82 - (85 - (39 + 29))? Let's compute inside the parentheses first. 39 +29=68. 85-68=17. Then 82-17=65. Not 71.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe combine two numbers first. Let's see, 85 and 82. If I subtract them: 85-82=3. Then I have 3, 29, 39. How to make 71 with those? 29 + 39=68. 68 +3=71. Wait, that adds up! But wait, that would be (85 - 82) + 29 + 39 = 3 +29+39=71. But does that use all the numbers? Let me check: 85,82,29,39. Yes, all used once. And the operations are subtraction and additions. So the equation would be 85 - 82 +29 +39 =71. But wait, that's correct? Let's compute:\n\n85 minus 82 is 3, plus 29 is 32, plus 39 is 71. Yes! That works. But wait, the problem requires that each number is used once. So in this case, the equation uses all four numbers once each. The operations are -, +, +. So that should be acceptable. Let me verify:\n\nNumbers used: 85, 82, 29, 39. All used once. Operations are subtraction and addition. The result is 71. So the equation is (85 - 82) + 29 + 39 =71. Alternatively, written without parentheses since subtraction is first, but order of operations would handle it. So yeah, that works. Hmm, maybe that's the answer. But let me check if there's another way, just to be thorough.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using division or multiplication. For example, 39 - (85 / (82 -29)). Let's compute denominator:82-29=53. Then 85/53≈1.603. Then 39 -1.603≈37.397, which is not 71. Not helpful.\n\nWhat if I try 82 - (85 - (39 -29))? Let's see: 39-29=10. 85-10=75. 82-75=7. Not 71.\n\nAnother idea: 85 - (82 / something) + others. Let's see. 82 divided by 29 is about 2.827. Then 85 -2.827=82.173, plus 39=121.173. No. Not helpful.\n\nHow about (85 +39) - (82 +29). 85+39=124. 82+29=111. 124-111=13. No.\n\nWait, 85 - (29 + 39) =85 -68=17. Then 82 -17=65. Not 71.\n\nHmm. Let's think again. The first solution I found seems correct. 85-82=3, then 3+29=32, 32+39=71. So equation is (85 -82) +29 +39=71. But since all numbers are used once, and operations are correct. That's the answer. Let me just make sure there's no mistake in the arithmetic.\n\nYes: 85-82=3. 3+29=32. 32+39=71. Perfect. So that's the equation.\n</think>\n\n<answer>85 - 82 + 29 + 39 = 71</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using the numbers 69, 63, 83, and 18, each exactly once, and combine them with basic arithmetic operations to get 882. Hmm, 882 is a pretty big number, so maybe multiplication is involved here. Let me start by thinking about possible products.\n\nFirst, let me check what 882 factors into. Let's divide 882 by some numbers. 882 divided by 2 is 441. Then 441 divided by 3 is 147, divided by 3 again is 49, which is 7 squared. So the prime factors of 882 are 2 × 3² × 7². Hmm, not sure if that helps immediately.\n\nLooking at the numbers given: 69, 63, 83, 18. Let's see if any of these can multiply to get close to 882. Let me try multiplying the two largest numbers first. 83 multiplied by 69. Let's calculate that: 80*69 is 5520, plus 3*69 is 207, so total is 5520+207=5727. That's way bigger than 882. Maybe 83 times 63? Let's see: 80*63=5040, plus 3*63=189, so 5040+189=5229. Still way too big. So maybe multiplying all of them isn't the way. Maybe combining multiplication and addition or subtraction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using division to bring down some numbers. For example, if I have a large product, then divide by a smaller number. Let's try. Suppose I do 83 * 63 = 5229. If I divide that by something... 5229 divided by 18 is around 290.5. Not 882. Hmm. Maybe 5229 divided by 69? 5229 ÷ 69. Let's see: 69*75 is 5175, so 5229 - 5175 = 54. So 75 + 54/69 = 75.78... Not helpful. Maybe that's not the right approach.\n\nWait, 63 and 18. 63 times 18 is 1134. If I can get 1134 and then subtract or add something to get to 882. 1134 - 882 = 252. So if I can get 252 from the remaining numbers. The remaining numbers would be 69 and 83. Let's see, 83 minus 69 is 14. 14 times 18 is 252. Wait, but 18 is already used. Hmm. Maybe another approach. Let's see, 63 * 18 = 1134. Then 1134 - (83 - 69) = 1134 -14=1120. Not 882. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe 69 * 13 = 897. But 13 isn't one of our numbers. Alternatively, 69 * 63 = 4347. Then 4347 divided by something. Let's see, 4347 ÷ 83 = let's calculate. 83*50=4150. 4347-4150=197. 197 ÷83 is about 2.37. So total is 52.37. Not helpful. Then 4347 divided by 18 is 241.5. Not helpful.\n\nWait, 882 divided by 63 is 14. So 63 *14=882. But 14 isn't one of the numbers. But maybe we can create 14 using the other numbers. Let's see, remaining numbers are 69,83,18. How can we get 14? 83 -69=14. Oh! That's possible. So 63 multiplied by (83 -69) would be 63*14=882. Wait, but we need to use all four numbers. If we do 63*(83 -69), that uses 63,83,69, but leaves out 18. So that's a problem. Because we have to use all four numbers. So maybe we need to include 18 somehow.\n\nWait, so maybe 63*(83 -69) +18. Let's see: 63*(14)=882, plus 18 would be 900. Not helpful. Alternatively, subtract 18? 882 -18=864. Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps multiply the result by 18 divided by something. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (63*(83 -69)) * (18 / something). Wait, but we have to use all numbers once. Let me think again. Let's see, the 63*(83-69)=882. But we're missing the 18. So maybe 63*(83 -69) / (18 / something). Wait, but we can't just divide by 18 unless we have another number. Wait, but all numbers must be used once. So perhaps we need to involve 18 in another part of the equation. Maybe like 63*(83 -69) +18, but that gives 900. Not 882. Or subtract 18? 882-18=864. Doesn't help. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 18 is part of the multiplication. Let's see: 18* something. 18*49=882. How to get 49? 83 - 69=14, and 63 divided by something. Wait, 63 divided by 14 is 4.5. Not 49. Alternatively, 83 - (63/ something). Maybe not.\n\nWait, 69 + 18=87. 87 * something. 87*10=870. Close to 882. 87*10.14=882. Not helpful. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider 69*13=897. Again, 13 is not a number. Maybe 63*(18) = 1134. Then 1134 - 83 -69=1134-152=982. Not 882. Hmm. Alternatively, 1134 - (83 +69)=1134 -152=982. Still no.\n\nWait, 83*18=1494. Then 1494 - 69* something. Let's see, 69*9=621. 1494 -621=873. Close to 882. 873 +9=882. But 9 isn't available. Alternatively, maybe use 63. 1494 - (69*63). Wait, 69*63=4347. 1494-4347 is negative. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, (83 -18)=65. Then 65* something. 65*13.5=877.5. Close but not exact. Hmm.\n\nWait, let's try different combinations. Let's see:\n\nUsing 83 and 69: 83-69=14\n\nThen 14 multiplied by 63=882. So 63*(83-69)=882. But where does 18 come into play? Oh, right, the problem requires using all four numbers. So this approach uses only three numbers. Therefore, invalid.\n\nSo we need to include 18 as well. Let's see. Maybe (63*(83 -69)) - 18=882-18=864. No. Or (63*(83 -69)) +18=900. Not helpful. Alternatively, 63*(83 -69 +18). Let's calculate 83-69+18=32. 63*32=2016. No. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, 63*(83 - (69 -18)). Let's compute inside the parentheses: 69-18=51. So 83-51=32. 63*32=2016. Still too big.\n\nWhat if we do (63 +18)*(83 -69). 63+18=81. 83-69=14. 81*14=1134. Not 882.\n\nAlternatively, 63*18=1134. Then 1134 - (83*3)=1134-249=885. Close, but we need 882. 885-3=882. But 3 isn't a number here. Alternatively, 83* something. 83*6=498. 1134-498=636. Not helpful.\n\nWait, another approach: 882 divided by 18 is 49. So if we can get 49 from 69,63,83. Let's see. 83 - 63=20. 69 -20=49. So (83-63)=20, then 69-20=49. Then 49*18=882. So equation would be (69 - (83 -63)) *18. Let's check:\n\n83-63=20\n\n69-20=49\n\n49*18=882. That works, and uses all numbers: 69,83,63,18. Each once. So that's the equation. Let me write that:\n\n(69 - (83 - 63)) * 18\n\nCompute step by step:\n\n83 -63 =20\n\n69 -20=49\n\n49*18=882. Perfect. So that's the correct equation. Let me double-check if that uses all numbers once. Yes: 69,83,63,18. All used once. Perfect. So the equation is (69 - (83 - 63)) * 18 = 882.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(69 - (83 - 63)) * 18</answer>"}]}

Let me start by thinking about how these numbers can combine. \n\nFirst, 292 is a relatively large number. The largest number I have is 80, so maybe I can use that as a base. Let's see. If I multiply 80 by something, what do I get? 80 times 3 is 240, which is still less than 292. 80 times 4 is 320, which is too big. So maybe combining 80 with another number through addition or subtraction.\n\nWait, 80 plus 52 is 132. That's not enough. 80 plus 28 is 108. 80 plus 13 is 93. Hmm. Maybe multiplication of two numbers first. Let's see. 52 times 28 is 1456. That's way too big. 52 times 13 is 676. Still too big. 28 times 13 is 364. That's closer to 292, but still over. 80 times 13 is 1040. No. 80 times 28 is 2240. Nope. \n\nAlternatively, maybe subtract some numbers. Let's try combinations. If I take 80 and 52. 80 + 52 = 132. Then subtract 28? 132 - 28 = 104. Then add 13? 104 +13=117. Not enough. What if I multiply 80 by something. Let's think. If I can get 80 multiplied by 3.65, that would give 292, but I have to use integers. Hmm.\n\nWait, another approach: 292 divided by 80 is 3.65. So maybe 80 times (something) equals 292. Let's see. But the other numbers are 52, 28, 13. How can I combine them to get 3.65? That seems tricky. Alternatively, maybe 80 times 3 plus 52. 80*3=240, 240+52=292. Wait, but where do I get the 3 from? The other numbers are 28 and 13. 28 -13=15. Not helpful. 28/13 is approximately 2.15. Maybe 80*(28/13) +52? Let's compute that: 28 divided by 13 is approximately 2.1538. 80*2.1538≈172.307, plus 52≈224.307. Not enough. \n\nAlternatively, 52* (80 -28) /13. Let's see. 80-28=52. So 52*52=2704, divided by 13 is 208. Still not 292. Hmm. \n\nWhat if I do 52 +28=80. But then I can't use 80 again. Wait, the numbers given are 52,28,13,80. So I have to use all four numbers once. So using 52 and 28 to make 80 would use up two numbers, but then the original 80 is still there. So that might not work. \n\nWait another idea: 80*3 +52=292. But to get 3 from 28 and 13. 28 -13=15. Hmm. Not helpful. Maybe 28/13≈2.15. So 80*(28/13) +52. Wait, 28/13 is approximately 2.1538. 2.1538*80≈172.3, plus 52≈224.3. Not 292. \n\nAlternatively, 52* (something) + something else. Let's see. 52*5=260. Then 260 +32=292. But 32 would need to come from 28 and 13 and 80. Wait, 28 +13=41. 80-41=39. Not 32. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, 28*13=364. Then 364 - something. 364 - 52=312, which is still more than 292. 312-80=232. Not helpful. \n\nWait, maybe (80 + 52) * something. 80+52=132. 132*2.21≈292. How to get 2.21 from 28 and13. 28/13≈2.15. Close but not exact. 132*(28/13)=132*2.1538≈285.7. Still not 292. \n\nWait, maybe 80*28=2240. Then 2240 divided by 13 is approximately 172.3. Then 172.3 +52=224.3. Not 292. \n\nHmm. Maybe subtraction. Let's think. 80*4=320. 320-28=292. But how to get 4 from 52 and13. 52 divided by13 is 4. Oh! Wait. 52 divided by13 is 4. So 80*(52/13) -28.

Let me see what's close to that. The largest number here is 97. If I multiply 97 by something, maybe I can get close. Let's try multiplying 97 by 8. 97 times 8 is 776. Oh, that's pretty close to 769. The difference between 776 and 769 is 7. So if I can subtract 7 from 776, that would give me 769. But how do I get 7 using the remaining numbers, which are 29 and 22?\n\nWait, the remaining numbers are 29 and 22. Let's see. 29 minus 22 is 7. Perfect! So if I do 29 - 22, that gives me 7. Then I can subtract that from 97*8. Putting it all together: 97*8 - (29 - 22). Let me check that. 97*8 is 776. Then 29-22 is 7. 776 -7 is 769. Yep, that works. But wait, have I used all the numbers? Let me see: 97, 8, 29, 22. Yes, all four numbers are used once. So the equation would be 97*8 - (29 - 22) = 769. That seems right. Let me double-check the arithmetic. 97 multiplied by 8: 90*8=720, 7*8=56, so 720+56=776. Then 29-22=7. 776-7=769. Exactly. So that's the equation.\n</think>\n\n<answer>97 * 8 - (29 - 22) = 769</answer>"}]}

All numbers must be used once with basic operations. Hmm, let's start by considering the target number 431. It's a bit less than 500, so maybe subtract something from 503. Let's see: 503 minus something equals 431. 503 - 431 = 72. So if I can make 72 from the remaining numbers 60, 99, 87. Wait, but 60, 99, 87 need to be used. Let's see. 99 minus 60 is 39, but that's not 72. 87 minus 60 is 27. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe multiply or divide. Let's see 99 divided by something? 99 divided by (something) to get close to 72. Maybe 99 - (87 - 60) = 99 -27 =72. Wait, that works. So 503 - (99 - (87 - 60)) = 503 - (99 -27) = 503 -72 =431. Wait, but wait: 87 -60 is 27, then 99 -27 is 72, then 503 -72 is 431. That uses all numbers: 503, 99, 87, 60. Let me check the order of operations. So the equation would be 503 - (99 - (87 - 60)) = 431. Let's compute step by step: 87-60=27. Then 99-27=72. Then 503-72=431. Yes, that works. So the equation is 503 - (99 - (87 - 60)) = 431. Let me make sure all numbers are used once: 503, 99,87,60. Yep. That's all four.

I need to create an equation using the numbers 22, 2, 44, and 8, each exactly once, with basic arithmetic operations, and the result should be 8. Hmm. Let me start by listing out the numbers and operations I can use: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.\n\nFirst, I should think about how to combine these numbers. Since 8 is one of the target numbers, maybe that can be part of the solution directly. For example, if I can somehow use the other numbers to get 1 and then multiply by 8, but wait, I have to use all numbers. Alternatively, maybe subtract or divide other numbers to get to 8.\n\nLet me consider 44 and 22. Dividing 44 by 22 gives 2. But I already have a 2 in the numbers. So if I do 44 / 22 = 2, then I have two 2s. But each number can only be used once. So that approach might not work unless I can combine them with the other numbers.\n\nWait, maybe 44 divided by something else. Let's see. 44 divided by (something) to get part of the equation. For example, if I take 44 and 8. 44 divided by 8 is 5.5, which isn't helpful. Maybe subtract 44 and 22? 44 -22=22. But then I have a 22 again, which is already used. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 22 minus 2 is 20. Then 20 plus 44 is 64. 64 divided by 8 is 8. Wait, but let's check if all numbers are used once. 22, 2 (used in 22-2), 44 (added to 20), and 8 (divided by). So yes, all numbers used once. Wait, that seems possible. Let me write that down:\n\n( (22 - 2) + 44 ) / 8\n\nCalculate step by step: 22-2=20, 20+44=64, 64/8=8. That works! But wait, the order of operations. Parentheses first. Yes, that equation would work. Let me verify again:\n\n22 - 2 = 20\n\n20 + 44 = 64\n\n64 / 8 = 8\n\nYes, that uses all numbers: 22, 2, 44, 8 each once. The operations are subtraction, addition, and division. So this should be correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe other combinations. Let me check another way to ensure there isn't a simpler one. For example, using multiplication. Suppose 8 is part of the result, maybe 2 * something. Let's see: 2 * (something) =8. Then something is 4. How to get 4 from 22, 44, 8. But that might not be straightforward. For example, 44 - (22 + 8) = 44 -30=14. Not 4. Hmm. Or 44 / (22 + 8) =44/30≈1.466. Not helpful.\n\nAnother approach: 8 divided by 2 is 4. Then perhaps 44 -22=22. 22 divided by 4 is 5.5. Not 8. Doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, 44 - (8*2) =44-16=28. Then 28 -22=6. Not 8. Not helpful.\n\nAnother idea: 22 / (44 / 8) - 2. Let's compute this. 44 divided by 8 is 5.5. Then 22 divided by 5.5 is 4. 4 minus 2 is 2. Not 8.\n\nHmm. Let's try another approach. Maybe 44 divided by 2 is 22. Then 22 minus 22 is 0. Then 0 +8=8. But here, 22 is used twice. Not allowed. So that's invalid.\n\nWait, but in this case, if I have 44/2=22, then subtract 22 (from the original numbers), then add 8. But that would be (44/2) -22 +8. Let's compute: 22 -22=0, 0+8=8. But here, 44 is divided by 2 (using 44 and 2), then subtract the original 22, then add 8. So all numbers used once: 44,2,22,8. Yes. So that equation is: (44 / 2) -22 +8. Let me check the calculation:\n\n44/2=22\n\n22 -22=0\n\n0 +8=8\n\nSo that works. But let me write this correctly with parentheses. Since division has higher precedence, so (44 / 2) is 22, then subtract 22 and add 8. So the equation would be (44 / 2) - 22 + 8 = 8. But wait, in this equation, the operations are division, subtraction, and addition. The numbers used are 44,2,22,8. Each exactly once. So that's another valid equation.\n\nBut which one is more straightforward? The first one I found was ((22 - 2) +44)/8 =8. The second one is (44/2) -22 +8=8. Both are valid.\n\nBut the problem says to return the equation in the answer. So either one would work. Let me check if there are any more possibilities.\n\nAnother possibility: (22 + 44) / (8 - 2). Let's compute: 22+44=66, 8-2=6, 66/6=11. Not 8.\n\nOr (44 - 8) / (22 - 2). 44-8=36, 22-2=20, 36/20=1.8. Not 8.\n\nHow about 22 - (44 / (8 +2)). 8+2=10, 44/10=4.4, 22-4.4=17.6. No.\n\nAlternatively, (44 - (22 +2)) * (8/8). Wait, but 8 can only be used once. So that's invalid.\n\nAnother idea: 8 * (44 - (22 +2)) / something. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, 2 * 8 =16. Then 44 -22=22. 22 -16=6. Not 8.\n\nHmm. So there are at least two valid equations: ((22 -2) +44)/8 and (44/2) -22 +8.\n\nWait, let's check the second equation again. (44 divided by 2) is 22. Then subtract 22 gives 0, then add 8. So 0+8=8. That works. So the equation is 44 / 2 -22 +8. Since all operations are left to right after division, the order is correct. So yes, 44/2 is 22, minus 22 is 0, plus 8 is 8.\n\nSo both equations are valid. The user may accept either. Let me see which one to present. The problem says to return the equation. Maybe either is acceptable. However, the first one has all numbers inside the numerator and divided by 8. Let me check if both equations are correct.\n\nYes, both are correct. But perhaps the second equation uses the numbers in a different order. However, the problem doesn't specify that the numbers need to be used in the order given. So either equation is acceptable.\n\nWait, but the numbers given are 22,2,44,8. So in the first equation, the order is (22-2)+44)/8. That uses 22,2,44,8. The second equation uses 44,2,22,8. But the problem doesn't require maintaining the order, so both are acceptable.\n\nTherefore, I can choose either. Let me present one of them. For example, the first one: ((22 - 2) +44) /8.\n\nBut let me also check if I can write it without extra parentheses. Since addition and subtraction have the same precedence, but in the first equation, the addition is after the subtraction. Wait, if I write (22 -2 +44)/8. Because 22-2 is 20, then 20+44=64. So yes, that works. So the equation could be (22 -2 +44)/8 =8. But to ensure the order, maybe the parentheses are needed? Actually, without parentheses, it's left associative. So 22 -2 +44 would be (22-2)+44, which is correct. So the equation could be written as (22 - 2 + 44) / 8 =8. So in the answer, it's (22 - 2 + 44) /8.\n\nAlternatively, the second equation is 44/2 -22 +8. Which is also correct.\n\nEither way, both equations are valid. Let me pick one. The first one seems more straightforward, grouping 22-2 first. So I'll go with that.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(22 - 2 + 44) / 8</answer>"}]}

Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to reach 398. Let me think about the numbers I have. The largest number here is 98, so maybe I can use that as a starting point. If I multiply 98 by something, how close does that get me? 98 times 4 is 392, which is 6 less than 398. But where would the 4 come from? Let's check the other numbers: 80, 20, and 19. If I subtract 20 from 80, that's 60. Hmm, not helpful. Wait, 80 divided by 20 is 4. Oh! That's a 4. So maybe 98 multiplied by (80/20) is 98*4=392. Then I need 6 more to reach 398. But I still have 19 left. Wait, 392 plus 19 would be 411, which is too much. Alternatively, 392 minus 19 is 373, which is too low. So that might not work. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can adjust the operations. What if I do 98*19? Let's calculate that. 98*19 is 1862, which is way too big. Not helpful. What about 80*20? That's 1600. Also way too big. Hmm. Maybe combining addition and subtraction. Let's see: 98 + 80 is 178. Then 178* something? 178*2 is 356, which is still below 398. 178*2.25 would be around 400, but we need exact numbers. \n\nWait, maybe using division and multiplication together. Let's consider 98*(something) + or - something else. For example, 98*(4) + (19 - something). Wait, 80/20 is 4, so 98*4 is 392. Then 392 + 19 is 411. But that's over. Alternatively, 392 + (20 -19) is 393. Still not enough. \n\nOr maybe rearrange the numbers. What if I do 80*5 =400, which is close. How to get 5? 19-20/ something. Wait, 20 divided by 4 is 5. But I need to use all numbers. Wait, maybe 19 - (20/ something). Let's see, 20 divided by (98 - 80) is 20/18 ≈1.111. Not helpful. \n\nAnother approach: 98*4=392, as before, then need 6 more. But where to get 6? Maybe 20 - (19 - something). Wait, but all numbers must be used. Wait, perhaps 98*(80/20) + (19). Wait, that gives 392 +19=411. No. Alternatively, 98*(80/20) -19=392-19=373. Not 398. \n\nWait, maybe 80*5 -2=398. How to get 5 and 2 from 20, 98, 19? Hmm. Let's think. 20 divided by 4 is 5, but again, not sure. Alternatively, 98 -19=79. 79 + something? Not sure. \n\nWait, what if I use 80*20=1600. Then 1600 divided by something. 1600/4=400. Then 400-2=398. How to get 4 and 2? But the numbers left would be 98 and 19. Maybe 98 divided by 19 is approximately 5.157. Not helpful. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, 80*(20 - (98/19)). Let me compute 98 divided by 19. 19*5=95, so 98/19≈5.157. So 20 -5.157≈14.842. 80*14.842≈1187.36. Not 398. \n\nAnother idea: 98 + 19=117. Then 117* something. 117*3=351. 117*4=468. Hmm. 351 is too low, 468 too high. Maybe 117*3 + something. Let's see, 351 + (80/20)=351+4=355. Not 398. \n\nWait, maybe 98* (20 - (19)) +80. So 98*(1) +80= 178. No. Not close. \n\nAlternatively, 98 +80=178. Then 178 +20=198. 198 +19=217. No. \n\nHow about 80*5 - (20 -19) =400 -1=399. Close, but not 398. How to get 5? 19 - (20/ something). Maybe 19 - (20/5)=19-4=15. Wait, but I need to use all numbers. \n\nWait, another approach: 98*4=392, then 392 +6=398. How to get 6 from 20 and 19? 20-19=1. Not enough. 20/19≈1.05. Not helpful. 19-20= -1. Hmm. Not useful. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps combine multiplication and subtraction. Let's try 19*20=380. Then 380 +80=460. 460 -98=362. No. \n\nWait, 98* (20 - (19)) is 98*1=98. Then 98 +80=178. Then 178* something. Not useful. \n\nWait, maybe (80 -19)=61. 61* something. 61*6=366. Then 366 +20=386. Still not 398. \n\nAlternatively, 80*20=1600. Then 1600 -98=1502. 1502 divided by 19. Let's calculate 1502/19. 19*79=1501. So 1502/19=79.0526. Not an integer. Not helpful. \n\nHmm. What if I do (98 +19)=117. Then 117*3=351. Then 351 +80=431. 431 -20=411. Not helpful. \n\nWait, let me think again. Maybe use division in a way that scales the number up. For example, 98 divided by something. 98/19≈5.157. Then 5.157*80≈412.5. Close to 398, but not exact. Then subtract 20? 412.5 -20≈392.5. Still not. \n\nAlternatively, 80/(20/98). Wait, that's 80/(20/98)=80*(98/20)= (80/20)*98=4*98=392. Then add 19? 392+19=411. No. \n\nHmm. Maybe 98*(20 - (19)) + (80). Which is 98*(1)+80=178. Not. \n\nAlternatively, 98 + (80/(20/19)). Let's compute 20/19≈1.0526. Then 80 divided by that is 80/1.0526≈76. So 98 +76=174. No. \n\nWait, maybe (80*19) - (98 +20). Let's compute 80*19=1520. Then 1520 -98=1422. 1422-20=1402. Not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, (19*20) + (98* something). 19*20=380. 380 + 98=478. 478 -80=398. Wait, let's check that. 19*20=380. Then 380 +98=478. Then subtract 80: 478-80=398. Oh! Wait, but have I used all numbers? Let's see: 19,20,98,80. Yes! Each used once. But the operations would be (19*20) +98 -80. Let me verify:\n\n19*20=380\n\n380 +98=478\n\n478 -80=398\n\nYes! That works.

Let me start by thinking about possible operations and combinations. \n\nFirst, since the target is 2, which is a small number, maybe subtraction or division could help here. Let's see. If I can get two numbers that are close to each other and subtract them, maybe that gives me a small number. For example, 69 and 57 are both in the 50s-60s. If I subtract them, 69 - 57 = 12. Hmm, that's 12. Not 2, but maybe if I use that result with another number. Wait, but I need to use all four numbers.\n\nAlternatively, division might be useful. For instance, if I can divide two numbers to get a smaller result. Let's try 80 divided by something. 80 divided by 40 is 2, but how can I get 40 from the remaining numbers? The remaining numbers are 57, 69, 23. Hmm, 57 - 23 = 34. 69 - 57 = 12. Not helpful. 23 is a prime number. Maybe 69 - (57 -23)? Let's calculate that: 57 -23 is 34, then 69 -34 is 35. 80 divided by 35 is about 2.285, which isn't 2. Close, but not exact.\n\nWait, another approach. Let's consider combining two numbers to make 82 or 78, then subtract the other. For example, 80 + 57 = 137. Then maybe subtract 69 and 23: 137 - 69 = 68; 68 -23=45. No. Not helpful.\n\nWhat if I use multiplication? 23 times something. 23*3=69. Oh, wait, 69 is one of the numbers. So 23*3 is 69, but we already have 69. Maybe 23 multiplied by something else. 23*2=46. If I can get 46 from the other numbers. 80 -57=23. Then 23*2=46. Wait, but that uses 80 and 57 to make 23, which is already in the list. But we can't reuse numbers. So that's not allowed.\n\nHmm. Let's try grouping. Maybe (80 - 57) / (69 -23). Let's compute numerator and denominator: 80-57=23; 69-23=46. So 23/46=0.5. Not 2.\n\nAlternatively, (69 -57) / (80 -23). 69-57=12; 80-23=57. 12/57≈0.2105. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe multiplication and division together. Let's think. If I can create fractions that multiply to 2. For example, (80 / 40) * (something). But 40 isn't here. Alternatively, 80 divided by (something) times another thing. Let's see.\n\nSuppose 80 / (57 - 23) = 80/34 ≈ 2.3529. Then multiply by (69 /69)=1. No, but 69 has to be used. Wait, perhaps 80 divided by (57 - (69/23)). Let's compute that: 69 divided by 23 is 3. Then 57 -3=54. Then 80/54≈1.481. Not 2.\n\nAlternatively, (57 -23) =34. 80 /34 ≈2.3529. Then 69 divided by something. If I take 80/34 multiplied by (69/x)=2. Let's see, solving for x: (80/34)*(69/x)=2 → (80*69)/(34x)=2 → (5520)/(34x)=2 → 5520=68x → x=5520/68=81.176. Not possible with remaining numbers.\n\nHmm. Let's try another path. Let's see if I can use subtraction and division. For example, (80 - (69 - (57 -23))). Let's compute inner brackets: 57-23=34; 69-34=35; 80-35=45. Not 2.\n\nHow about (80 + 23) - (57 +69). 103 - 126 = -23. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe (80 - (57 +23)) +69. 57+23=80; 80-80=0; 0+69=69. Nope.\n\nAlternatively, (69 - (80 -57)) *23. Let's see: 80-57=23; 69-23=46; 46*23=1058. Not 2.\n\nAnother idea: using division and subtraction. Let's see, 57 divided by 23 is approximately 2.478. If I can adjust that to get 2. So 57/23 = 2.478..., then subtract 0.478. How? But how to get 0.478 from the remaining numbers 80 and 69. Not straightforward.\n\nWait, maybe 57 divided by something. Let's say 57/(23 + (80-69)). Let's compute: 80-69=11; 23+11=34. 57/34≈1.676. Not 2.\n\nAlternatively, (69 -57) =12. 80 divided by 40 is 2. How to get 40 from 12 and 23. 23 + 12=35. 80/35≈2.285. Not quite.\n\nWait, maybe ((80 / (57 -23)) * (69/69)) - but 69/69 is 1. Then 80/(57-23)=80/34≈2.3529. So 2.3529*1=2.3529. Still not 2. But we used all numbers? Let's check: 80,57,23,69. If I write it as (80 / (57 -23)) * (69 /69). Then yes, all numbers are used. But 69 divided by 69 is 1. So the equation becomes (80 /34)*1 ≈2.3529. Not 2. Not exact.\n\nHmm. Maybe subtraction of two divisions? For example, (80/40) - (something). 80/40=2. Then subtract zero. But how? If I can get 80/40 and then subtract (something - something else) that equals zero. For example, 80/(57 - (69 -23)). Let's compute denominator: 69-23=46; 57-46=11. So 80/11≈7.27. Then subtract zero? Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 80/(23 + something) - another fraction. Let's see, 23 + (57 -69) =23 + (-12)=11. Then 80/11≈7.27. Then subtract 5.27 to get 2. But how? Not with the remaining numbers. Not sure.\n\nAnother angle: Let's see if 23 can be used in a way that creates 2. For example, 23 -21=2. But where to get 21? 57-36=21. 36 from 80-44. This seems too convoluted.\n\nWait, here's a thought: 69 divided by 23 is 3. Then 57 divided by (something) to get 3. 57/19=3. But 19 isn't available. Alternatively, 80 - 57=23. Wait, but then we can't reuse 23. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe combine operations: (80 - 57) =23, then (69 -23)=46. So 23/46=0.5. But then how to get to 2? Not sure. Maybe multiply by 4? But where to get 4. The numbers left are 80,57,69,23. If I already used them in the operations, perhaps this approach isn't working.\n\nAlternatively, (57 -23)=34. Then 80/34≈2.3529. Then 2.3529 * (69/69)=2.3529. Not 2.\n\nWait, maybe (57 +23) =80. Then 80/80=1. Then 69 -1=68. Not helpful. But that would use 57,23,80. Then 69 left. Not useful.\n\nAnother approach: Let's try to make 2 by dividing two numbers. For example, 46/23=2. But how to get 46 from 80,57,69. 69-23=46. Wait, 69-23=46. Then 46/23=2. But then I have 80 and 57 left. How to incorporate them? Maybe 80 -57=23. Then 46/23=2, and 80-57=23. But combining these? How to use all four numbers.\n\nWait, if I do (69 -23)/(80 -57). Let's compute numerator:69-23=46. Denominator:80-57=23. So 46/23=2. Yes! That's 2. And all numbers are used: 69,23,80,57. Each used exactly once. Let me check:\n\n69 -23 =46\n\n80 -57=23\n\nThen 46 divided by 23 equals 2. So the equation is ((69 -23)/(80 -57)) =2. That uses all four numbers once each. Perfect!\n</think>\n\n<answer>(69 - 23) / (80 - 57)</answer>"}]}

We need to use all the numbers 57, 5, 73, and 2 exactly once with basic operations to get 182. Hmm, let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to reach 182. Let me see what operations can get me there. Maybe multiplication is key here because 182 is a relatively large number. Let's check the numbers we have. 73 is the largest, followed by 57. If I multiply 73 by 2, that's 146. Then maybe add 57? Wait, 146 +57 is 203. That's too much. Or subtract? 146 -57 is 89. Not helpful. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, what if I multiply 57 and 5? 57*5=285. Then subtract 73? 285-73=212. Still not 182. Then maybe divide by 2? 212/2=106. No. Alternatively, maybe 57*5 - (73+2) = 285 -75=210. Still not.\n\nWait, maybe 73*2 is 146. Then 57*5=285. 285-146=139. Not helpful. Hmm. Let's think differently. What if we combine addition and multiplication. For example, 73 +57=130. Then 130* something. But we have to use 5 and 2. 5 and 2 can be 10. 130*1.4=182. Wait, 130*1.4=182. But how to get 1.4 using 5 and 2. 7/5=1.4. But we don't have 7. Alternatively, 2.8/2=1.4. Hmm, not sure.\n\nWait, maybe 73*2.5=182.5. Close, but we need 182. And we don't have 2.5, but maybe we can make 2.5 by 5/2. Let's check: 73*(5/2) = 73*2.5=182.5. But that's 182.5, not exactly 182. Also, we need to use all numbers. So 73*(5/2)=182.5, but we have to use 57 as well. Hmm. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, 57*3.19… but that seems messy. Let me think again. Let's see 182 divided by 73 is 2.493... which is close to 2.5, which is 5/2. But as before, that gives 182.5. Not exact.\n\nWait, maybe subtract something. For example, 73*(5/2) - 57/ something. But 73*(5/2) is 182.5. If we subtract 0.5, that would get 182. How can we get 0.5 using 57 and the other numbers? Wait, but we already used 5 and 2. So all numbers must be used once. So maybe:\n\nWait, if I do (73 * (5 - (2/57))). Let's calculate that. 2/57 is approximately 0.035. So 5 - 0.035=4.965. 73*4.965≈73*5 -73*0.035≈365 -2.555≈362.445. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 57*2 +73* something. 57*2=114. 182-114=68. So 73* something equals 68. But 68 is less than 73. So maybe 73 - (5) =68. So 57*2 +73 -5. Let's check: 114 +73=187-5=182. Wait, that works! Let me verify:\n\nNumbers used: 57, 2, 73, 5. All used once. 57*2=114. 114+73=187. 187-5=182. Yes! So the equation would be 57*2 +73 -5 =182. Let me check the arithmetic again. 57*2 is 114. 114+73 is indeed 187. 187 minus 5 is 182. Perfect. That uses all numbers once with operations +, *, -.\n</think>\n\n<answer>57 * 2 + 73 - 5 = 182</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using the numbers 22, 12, 24, and 22, each exactly once, and the result has to be 2. Hmm, basic operations only: plus, minus, multiply, divide. Alright, let me start by listing out the numbers. Wait, there are two 22s. So I have 22, 12, 24, and another 22. All must be used once.\n\nFirst, maybe I can look for pairs that can give me numbers which then combine to 2. Since 2 is a small number, division might be necessary here. Let's see. If I can get two numbers to divide into 1 or 2, then add or subtract with the others.\n\nLet's try dividing the two 22s. If I do 22 divided by 22, that's 1. Then I have 12 and 24 left. How can I combine 12 and 24 to get 1? Wait, 24 divided by 12 is 2. Then if I take the 1 from the 22s and subtract (24/12=2), that would be 1 - 2 = -1. Not helpful. Alternatively, maybe 22/22=1, then 24/12=2, so 1 + 2=3. Still not 2. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe combine 24 and 12 first. 24 divided by 12 is 2. Then I have two 22s left. If I subtract them, 22 - 22=0. Then 2 + 0=2. But wait, that uses 24/12=2, and 22-22=0, then adding them gives 2. So the equation would be (24 / 12) + (22 - 22) = 2 + 0 = 2. Does that work? Let's check: All numbers used once: 24,12,22,22. Yes. The operations are division, subtraction, and addition. So that equation would be (24 / 12) + (22 - 22) = 2. That seems valid. Let me verify:\n\n24 divided by 12 is 2. 22 minus 22 is 0. 2 plus 0 equals 2. Perfect. So that works. But wait, is there another way? Let me check if there are other possibilities just to be sure.\n\nAnother approach: Using multiplication. For example, 22 - (24 / (22 - 12)). Let's compute that step by step. 22 - 12 = 10. Then 24 divided by 10 is 2.4. Then 22 - 2.4 = 19.6. Not 2. Hmm. Not helpful.\n\nWhat if I do (22 + 22) divided by (24 - 12). That's (44) / (12) = 3.666..., which is not 2. No good.\n\nAlternatively, 24 - (22 + 22) + 12. Let's see: 24 - 44 +12 = (24+12) -44 = 36-44= -8. Not 2.\n\nHow about 12 divided by (24 - (22/22)). Let's compute denominator first: 22/22=1. 24 -1=23. Then 12/23 ≈ 0.521… Not helpful.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe 22 divided by (something) to get a 11, but not sure. Let's see. 22 divided by 12 is about 1.833. Maybe 24 divided by 12 is 2, then subtract (22/22)=1. So 2 -1=1. Not enough.\n\nWait, the first idea I had with (24/12) + (22-22) = 2 is correct. Let me just make sure all numbers are used once. 24,12,22,22. Yes, each used once. So that's a valid equation. So the answer would be (24 / 12) + (22 - 22) = 2. Or maybe written with parentheses as needed. Alternatively, could arrange it as (24 / 12) + (22 - 22) but the structure is same. That seems to be the solution. Let me think if there's another way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (22 - 22) + (24 / 12) = 0 + 2 = 2. Same thing. Another arrangement. So I think that's the correct equation.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(24 / 12) + (22 - 22) = 2</answer>"}]}

Let me think about possible combinations.\n\nLet me list the numbers: 50, 92, 212, 95. The target is 349. Let's see the sum of all numbers: 50 + 92 + 212 + 95. Let me calculate that. 50+92 is 142, 142+212 is 354, 354+95 is 449. That's way over 349. So maybe some subtraction or division is needed here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can combine some numbers to make larger numbers and subtract others.

Maybe 117 + 50 + 92 = 259. Not enough. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe multiply some numbers. Let's think. If I multiply 50 and 92, that's 4600, which is way too big. 212 divided by something? Let's see. If I do 212 divided by a number, maybe 50, but 212/50 is 4.24. Not helpful. Maybe 95 - 50 = 45. Then 45 multiplied by something. 45*7=315, but not sure.\n\nWait, let's try combining 212 and 50. 212 + 50 = 262. Then 349 - 262 = 87. So I need 87 from 92 and 95. How? 95 - 92 = 3. Then 262 +3 = 265. Not enough. Or 92 - (95 / something). Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 212 - 92 = 120. Then 120 + something. 50 + 95 =145. 120 +145=265. Still not 349. Not helpful.\n\nWhat if I do 212 + 95 = 307. Then 50* something. 50*7=350, which is close. But how to get 7. 92 divided by something. 92/13 ≈7.07. But 13 isn't in the numbers. Alternatively, 92 - 50 =42. 42/6=7. But again, not sure.\n\nWait, let me try another approach. Let's see: 349 is close to 350, which is 50*7. So maybe 50*7 -1=349. But how to get 7 and 1 from the remaining numbers. Let's see. The remaining numbers are 92, 212, 95. Maybe 95 - (212 / 92). But 212 divided by 92 is about 2.3. So 95 -2.3=92.7. Then 50*92.7 is way off. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (212 + 95) = 307. Then 307 + 92 = 399. Then subtract 50: 399-50=349. Wait, that's 212 + 95 +92 -50. Let me check: 212+95 is 307, 307+92=399, 399-50=349. Yes! Wait, that uses all numbers once: 212,95,92,50. So the equation would be 212 +95 +92 -50 =349. Let me verify:\n\n212 +95 =307, 307+92=399, 399-50=349. Yes! That works. But wait, the problem states that each number can be used once and all must be used.

I need to create an equation using the numbers 72, 18, 56, and 66, each exactly once, with basic operations to equal 924. Hmm, 924 is a pretty big number, so maybe multiplication will be involved here. Let me think about how these numbers can combine.\n\nFirst, let me look at the target number: 924. Let me factorize it to see if that helps. 924 divided by 2 is 462, divided by 2 again is 231. 231 is 3*7*11. So 924 is 2*2*3*7*11. Now, looking at the given numbers: 72 is 8*9 or 2^3 *3^2, 18 is 2*3^2, 56 is 7*8 or 7*2^3, and 66 is 6*11 or 2*3*11. \n\nSo maybe I can pair the factors. Let's see, 66 has 11, which is a prime needed in 924. So maybe 66 should be multiplied by something. If I multiply 66 by 14, I get 924. But 14 isn't one of the numbers. Wait, but maybe I can create 14 using the other numbers. Let's see. 56 divided by 4 is 14. But how to get 4? 72 divided by 18 is 4. So maybe that's a path. Let's try: 66 * (56 / (72 / 18)). Let's compute that step by step. 72 divided by 18 is 4. Then 56 divided by 4 is 14. Then 66*14 = 924. That works! Let me check if all numbers are used once: 72,18,56,66. Yes, each is used once. So the equation would be 66 * (56 / (72 / 18)) = 924. Let me write that as (66 × (56 ÷ (72 ÷ 18))) to make the order clear. \n\nWait, let me verify the calculation. 72 divided by 18 is indeed 4. Then 56 divided by 4 is 14. Multiply that by 66: 66*14. Let's compute 66*10=660, 66*4=264; 660+264=924. Yep, that's correct. So all numbers are used once, and the operations are multiplication, division, and division again. So that should be the equation.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(66 * (56 / (72 / 18)))</answer>"}]}

Let's see, 75 multiplied by 8 would be 600, so 75*8=600. Then adding 55 would get to 655. But I don't have an 8 or a 55. Wait, but maybe I can make 8 or 55 from the remaining numbers. The numbers left would be 20, 6, 54. Hmm. Let's see, 54 divided by 6 is 9. So 75*(54/6) would be 75*9=675. Then subtract 20 to get 655. Wait, 75*(54/6) -20. Let's check that. 54 divided by 6 is 9. 75*9=675. 675-20=655. Oh! That works! Wait, but let me check again. 54 divided by 6 is 9, right. 75 times 9 is 675. 675 minus 20 is 655. Yes! So that uses all numbers: 75, 54, 6, and 20. Each once. So the equation would be 75*(54/6) -20 =655. Let me write that in the correct format. So parentheses around 54/6. Then multiply by 75, subtract 20. So the equation is (75 * (54 / 6)) - 20. Let me verify once more. 54 divided by 6 is 9. 75 multiplied by 9 is 675. 675 minus 20 is indeed 655. Perfect! So that's the solution.\n</think>\n\n<answer>75 * (54 / 6) - 20 = 655</answer>"}]}

Let's start by thinking about how these numbers can combine.\n\nFirst, maybe I should look for pairs that can get close to 117. Let's check some combinations. 84 is a big number. If I subtract something from 84, maybe? 84 - 67 = 17, which is way too low. 84 + 67 = 151, which is higher than 117. 70 + 60 = 130, still higher. 84 - 60 = 24. Not helpful. \n\nWait, 70 + 67 = 137.

Not sure. \n\nLet me think about division more. If I can get a fraction that adds or subtracts to another number. For example, 84 divided by 70 is 1.2. Then 1.2 times 60 is 72. Then 72 + 67 = 139.

That's way too big. 84 * 67 = 5628. Also way too big. So probably multiplication of two numbers is too big. Maybe division can help reduce.\n\nWait, 84 divided by something. For example, 84 / 70 = 1.2. Then 1.2 * 60 = 72. Then 72 + 67 = 139. Still not right. \n\nHow about 67 + (84 - 70). That would be 67 +14 = 81. Then 81 + 60 = 141. No. \n\nWait, maybe 70 + 67 = 137.

Then 81 + 60 = 141. Not helpful. \n\nWait, 84 - 60 = 24. Then 24 * 5 = 120. But where do I get 5? Maybe 70 divided by something. 70 divided by 14 is 5, but I don't have 14. Alternatively, 70 divided by (67 - something). Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, 67 + 60 = 127. Then 127 - 10 = 117. How to get 10 from 70 and 84. 84 - 70 = 14. Not 10. 70 / 7 = 10, but where to get 7. Maybe 84 - 67 = 17. 70 - 17 = 53. Not helpful. \n\nWait, maybe use multiplication and division. Let's see, 84 * (70 - 67) = 84 * 3 = 252. Then 252 - 60 = 192. No. \n\nOr 70 * (84 - 67) = 70 *17 = 1190. Then 1190 / 60 is about 19.83. Not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, 84 / (70 - 67) = 84 /3 = 28. Then 28 * 60 = 1680. Not helpful. \n\nWait, maybe 67 + 50 = 117.

If I can combine those in a way that gets close to 175, then use the smaller numbers to adjust. Let's see: 59 plus 40 is 99. That's too low. 59 multiplied by 3 is 177, which is close. Oh, 177 is just 2 more than 175. But how can I get 177 minus 2 using the remaining numbers? Wait, I have 4 and 3 left. If I do 59*3=177, then maybe subtract (4 - something). Wait, but I have to use all numbers once.\n\nWait, 59*3 is 177. Then if I have 40 and 4 left. Maybe 40 divided by 4 is 10. So 177 - 10 is 167. Not enough. Or 177 - (40/4) = 177 -10=167. Hmm. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 59 + 40 = 99. Then how can I use 3 and 4 to get from 99 to 175. 175-99=76. So I need 76 more. 3 and 4. 3*4=12, which is way less. 3^4 is 81, but exponents aren't allowed. Wait, only basic operations: +, -, *, /. So maybe 3*40=120. Then 120 +59=179. Then subtract 4? 179-4=175. Wait, but then I used 3,40,59,4. That's all numbers. Let's check: 3*40=120. 120 +59=179. 179 -4=175. Yes! That works. So the equation would be (3*40) +59 -4 = 175. Let's verify:\n\n3*40=120. 120+59=179. 179-4=175. Correct. All numbers used once. Perfect!\n</think>\n\n<answer>(3 * 40) + 59 - 4 = 175</answer>"}]}

Let me start by thinking about how these numbers can combine.\n\nFirst, 144 is a multiple of 12 squared, but I'm not sure if that's helpful here. Let's look at the numbers. 70 is the largest, followed by 35, then 24, and 3. Maybe subtracting or adding some of them could get close. Let me try some combinations.\n\n70 minus 35 is 35. Then 24 divided by 3 is 8. 35 times 8 is 280. That's way too high. Hmm. Maybe another approach. What if I multiply 35 and 3 first? 35*3=105. Then 70+24=94. 105+94=199, which is over. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 70 divided by something. 70 divided by 35 is 2. Then 24*3=72. 2*72=144. Wait, that seems possible. Let me check. If I take 70/35=2, then 24*3=72. Then multiply those two results: 2*72=144. But wait, does that use all numbers? Let me see: 70, 35, 24, 3. Yes, each is used once. So the equation would be (70 / 35) * (24 * 3) = 144. Let me calculate that step by step. 70 divided by 35 is 2. 24 times 3 is 72. Then 2 multiplied by 72 is indeed 144. That works! So the equation is (70 / 35) * (24 * 3) = 144. Let me make sure I didn't miss any other possibilities, but this seems to fit all the requirements: all numbers used once, operations are basic, and the result is correct.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(70 / 35) * (24 * 3) = 144</answer>"}]}

Maybe I need to combine other numbers to make a multiplier.\n\nLooking at 15 and 6. 15 times 6 is 90. Then 90 times 11 is 990. Wait, but where would 11 come from? Oh, maybe using 77 divided by 7. Because 77 divided by 7 is 11. So putting that together: 15 * 6 * (77 / 7) = 15*6*11 = 90*11 = 990. Wait, does that use all the numbers? Let's check: 15, 6, 77, 7.

Let's check the numbers: 31 is the smallest, then 60, 62, and 71. The target is 82. Let me see.\n\nIf I take 71 and 60, adding them gives 131, which is way too big. Subtracting 60 from 71 gives 11, but that's not helpful. How about 62 and 60? 62 + 60 = 122. 62 - 60 = 2. Maybe that 2 could be part of a multiplication or division.\n\nWait, 31 is a prime number. Maybe multiplying it with something. Let's see: 31 * 2 = 62. But I already have 62 as a number. Wait, but if I use 62 somehow with other numbers. Maybe 62 divided by something? 62 / 31 is 2. Then 2 * 60 is 120. 120 minus something? But then I have 71 left. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, 71 minus something. 71 - 31 = 40. Then 62 - 60 = 2. 40 * 2 = 80. Close but not 82. Or 40 + 2 = 42. No.\n\nWait, maybe combine 71 and 62 first. 71 + 62 = 133. Then subtract 60 gives 73, and then 73 plus 31 is 104. Not helpful.\n\nAnother approach: Let's think of 82 as 80 + 2. How can we get 80 and then add 2. For example, 60 + 20 = 80. Then adding 2. But where do 20 and 2 come from? Alternatively, 62 - 60 = 2, then 2 * 31 = 62. But that's redundant.\n\nWait, 60 divided by something. 60 / (something) = maybe 15. Then 15 + 67 = 82. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, 71 - (something) = 82.

Not sure.\n\nWait, 60 divided by (something). Let's see 60 / (31 - something). Hmm. Maybe 31 * 2 = 62. Then 62 + 60 = 122. 122 - something. If I have 71 left, 122 - 71 = 51. Not 82.\n\nWait, 71 + 60 = 131. 131 minus something. 131 - 31 = 100. Then 100 - 62 = 38. Not helpful.\n\nWhat if I use multiplication and division. Let's try 62 * (something). If I can get 62 * 1.322... which is roughly 82, but that's not straightforward. Alternatively, 71 + (60 / (something)). Let's see: 60 divided by 31 is about 1.935. 71 + 1.935 is ~72.9, not enough.\n\nWait, maybe 71 + (62 - 60) = 71 + 2 = 73. Then 73 + 31 = 104. Nope.\n\nHow about (71 - 31) = 40. Then 62 - 60 = 2. 40 * 2 = 80. Then 80 + 2? But where's the 2? Wait, but we already used all numbers. Hmm, 40 * 2 is 80, but then we used 71,31,62,60. So all numbers are used. But that gives 80. We need 82. Close. Maybe there's a different combination.\n\nWait, maybe (62 + 60) = 122. Then subtract (71 - 31) = 40. 122 - 40 = 82. Wait, let's check that:\n\n62 + 60 = 122.\n\n71 - 31 = 40.\n\n122 - 40 = 82.\n\nYes! That uses all numbers once. So the equation would be (62 + 60) - (71 - 31) = 82.

So I need to make 133 using 49, 21, and 57. Let's see. Let me check the remaining numbers. 49, 21, 57. How can I combine these to get 133? Let's try adding them up: 49 + 21 + 57 = 127. That's close but 10 short. Hmm. Maybe subtract instead. Let's see, maybe 57 - 21 = 36, then 49 + 36 = 85. Not enough. Alternatively, 57 * 21 is 1197, which is way too big. But maybe using division or subtraction. Let's think differently. 57 + 49 = 106. 106 +21=127. Still 127. Wait, that's the same as before. Maybe multiplication. Let's see, 57 * 2 = 114, but I don't have a 2. Wait, maybe 57 multiplied by something else. Let's see. 49 and 21. 21 is 3*7, 49 is 7^2. Maybe 57*21=1197. Then 1197 - 49 = 1148. Hmm, not helpful.

So probably addition. Let me think again. 864 + x = 997, so x=133. So I need to get 133 from 49,21,57. Let's try 57*2 +49. But 57*2=114, 114+49=163. No. Wait, 57*(21/ something). Wait, 21 and 49. Let's see. 57 + (49 +21) = 57+70=127. Still 127. Maybe 57* (21 - (49/ something)). Wait, 49 divided by something. If I use 49 divided by 7, but I don't have a 7. Hmm. Wait, the numbers I have are 49,21,57. Let's see, 21 is 3*7. 49 is 7^2. So maybe use 49 and 21 together. Like 49 +21=70. Then 70 +57=127. As before. Still 127. 133-127=6. So maybe I need to get 6 more. How? Maybe multiply instead. 57*21=1197. 1197 divided by something. If I divide by 9, 1197/9=133. But how to get 9 from the remaining numbers. Wait, 49 is left. 49 isn't 9. Alternatively, 49 -21=28. Then 57-28=29. Hmm. Not helpful. Alternatively, 57 - (49 -21) =57-28=29. Still not helpful. Let's try different combinations. Maybe 57* (49 -21). Let's calculate that: 49-21=28. 57*28=1596. Then 864 +1596=2460. Way over. No. Alternatively, 57 divided by something. 57/21 is roughly 2.714.

Then subtract 49=2012. Still not. Alternatively, 57* (21 - (49/something)). Hmm. Wait, 49 divided by something. If I do 49/7=7, but 7 isn't a number I have. The numbers I have left after using 57, 21, and 49 would be 864. Wait, I need to use all four numbers. Let me try a different approach. Let's see 997 is 1000 -3.

Let's compute 49/21≈2.333. 807*2.333≈1883. That's not helpful. Hmm. Maybe I need to use division in a different way. Let's see. Suppose we take 57 and 21. 57 -21=36. Then 864 +36=900. Then 900 +49=949. That's still 48 short. Alternatively, 57*21=1197. Then 1197 -49=1148. 1148 -864=284. Not helpful. Hmm. Let's try another angle. Maybe 49*21=1029. Then 1029 + something. 1029 +57=1086. 1086 -864=222. No. Alternatively, 49*21=1029. Then 1029 -57=972. 972 +864=1836. No. Not close. Hmm. What if I subtract 864 from something else. For example, 57*21*49. That's way too big. Maybe 57* (864/21). Let's compute 864 divided by21. 864 ÷21≈41.142. 57*41.142≈2345. Then subtract 49: 2345-49=2296. Still no. Alternatively, (864/49) *57. 864/49≈17.632. 17.632*57≈1005. Then 1005 -21=984. Close, but 997-984=13. Hmm. Alternatively, 864/21=41.142. 41.142*57≈2345. Then 2345 -49=2296. No. Hmm. Let's think again. Maybe combine 864 and 49. 864 +49=913. Then 913 +57=970. Then +21=991. Again, 6 short. Alternatively, 864 + (49*21). 49*21=1029. 864 +1029=1893. Then 1893 -57=1836. No. Hmm. What if we do 864 -57=807. Then 807 + (49*21)=807 +1029=1836. No. Still not. Let's try using division in a way that creates a larger number. For example, 57 / (21/49). Dividing by a fraction is multiplying by its reciprocal. So 21/49 = 3/7. So 57 divided by 3/7 is 57 *7/3=133. Oh! Wait, that's 133. Then 864 +133=997. Wait, that works! Let me check that again. So if I take 21 divided by 49, that's 3/7. Then 57 divided by (21/49) is 57 * (49/21). 49/21 simplifies to 7/3. So 57 * (7/3) = 57 *7 /3 = (57/3)*7 = 19*7=133. Then 864 +133=997. So the equation would be 864 + (57 / (21/49)) = 997. Let me confirm the numbers used: 864, 57, 21, 49. Yes, all used once. And the operations: division and addition. So the equation is 864 + (57 ÷ (21 ÷ 49)) = 997. Which can be written as 864 + (57 * (49 /21)) if we simplify the division. But since division is allowed, the original form works. Let me check the calculation again. 21 divided by49 is 3/7. Then 57 divided by (3/7) is 57 *7/3=133. Then 864 +133=997. Yep, that's correct. So the equation is 864 + (57 / (21 /49)) =997. But we need to use all numbers and each only once. Let me check: 864 is used, 57 is used, 21 and 49 are used in the denominator. Yes, all four numbers are used once. Perfect.\n</think>\n\n<answer>864 + (57 / (21 / 49)) = 997</answer>"}]}

The largest number here is 66, followed by 60. 380 is a bit less than 6 times 66 (which is 396), but that's over. Maybe multiplying some of the larger numbers together and then adjusting with the smaller ones?\n\nAlternatively, maybe adding two numbers to get close and then multiplying or subtracting. Let's see. 60 and 38: 60 + 38 = 98. Not helpful. 66 + 38 = 104. Still not close. What if I multiply some of them? Let's try 60 multiplied by something. 60*6=360, which is 20 less than 380. Wait, but 6 isn't one of the numbers. Hmm.\n\nWait, 60*6.333... would be 380. But how to get 6.333... Maybe 38 divided by 6? But 38/6 is about 6.333. But then I need a 6. Let's see: 66 divided by 11 is 6. So maybe 60 multiplied by (38 divided by (66/11))? Let's check that:\n\n66 divided by 11 is 6. Then 38 divided by 6 is approximately 6.333. Then 60 * 6.333 is 380. Exactly! So that would be 60 * (38 / (66 / 11)) = 380. Let's verify that step by step.\n\nFirst, compute 66 divided by 11: 66/11 = 6. Then divide 38 by that result: 38 / 6 = 6.333... Then multiply by 60: 60 * 6.333... = 60 * (19/3) = 380. Yes, that works. So the equation is 60 * (38 / (66 / 11)) = 380. Let me check if all numbers are used exactly once: 60, 38, 66, 11. Yes, all are used once. The operations are division inside the parentheses, then multiplication. That should work.\n</think>\n\n<answer>60 * (38 / (66 / 11)) = 380</answer>"}]}

Hmm, this seems a bit tricky, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, maybe I should look at the numbers and see if any pairs can be combined to get closer to 72. Let's list them again: 86, 253, 70, 165. Let me think about possible operations between pairs.\n\nStarting with the largest number, 253. If I subtract something from 253 to get close to 72, maybe. Let's see: 253 minus what? If I use another number here. Let's say 253 - 165. That gives 88. Hmm, 88 is not 72, but maybe I can adjust with the remaining numbers. Then we have 86 and 70 left. Let's see, 88 - (86 - 70). Wait, 86 - 70 is 16. Then 88 - 16 is 72. So that might work. Let me check:\n\n253 - 165 = 88\n\nThen 86 - 70 = 16\n\n88 - 16 = 72\n\nSo putting it all together: (253 - 165) - (86 - 70) = 72. Let me verify:\n\n253 minus 165 is indeed 88. Then 86 minus 70 is 16. Subtracting those gives 72. Yes! All numbers are used once, and the operations are valid. Let me make sure there's no mistake here. Each number is used once: 253, 165, 86, 70. All four numbers are included. The operations are subtraction and subtraction, but since each number is used once, that's okay. So the equation would be (253 - 165) - (86 - 70) = 72. That should work. Let me check another possibility to see if there's another way, but this one seems to fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using division or multiplication. For instance, 70 divided by something. 70 divided by (something) to get a smaller number. But 70 divided by a larger number would give a fraction, which might complicate things. Let's see, 70 / (253 - 165) = 70/88 ≈ 0.795, which doesn't help much. What if we do 86 - (253 - 165) / something. Wait, maybe that's more complex. Let me think again about the first solution. It seems straightforward and works. So I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(253 - 165) - (86 - 70) = 72</answer>"}]}

Let me start by thinking about how these numbers can combine. \n\nFirst, 835 is a pretty big number. If I subtract something from it, maybe that could get close. Let's see: 835 minus... what? Let's see, 835 - 24 = 811, which is way too high. If I subtract 53, that's 782. Still too big. Subtract 98? 835 - 98 = 737. Hmm, not helpful. Maybe adding some numbers first. Wait, but all numbers need to be used once. So I have to use all four numbers in some combination.\n\nAlternatively, maybe multiplication. Let's see, 24 and 53: 24 * 53 is 1272. If I subtract that from 835? 835 - 1272 would be negative, which might not help. Or maybe divide. Let's see. 835 divided by 24 is about 34.79, which isn't helpful. How about 98 divided by something? 98/24 is around 4.08. Then multiply by 53? 4.08*53 ≈ 216.24. 835 minus that would be 618.76, not 339. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe combining 53 and 98 first. Let's see: 53 + 98 = 151. Then 151 multiplied by something. 151*24=3624. Then 835 - 3624 is way too negative. Not helpful. Alternatively, 53*98=5194. That's way too big. Maybe subtract 53 from 98: 98-53=45. Then 45*24=1080. 835 - 1080= -245. Not helpful.\n\nLet me try a different approach. The target is 339. Let's see if 53 can be part of that. 53*6=318, which is 21 less than 339. Hmm. Or 53*6.4=339.2, which is close. So maybe 53 times something close to 6.4. But how to get that from 835, 24, and 98. Let me think.\n\nWait, 98 - 24 = 74. Then 74 divided by something? 74/53 ≈1.396. That's not helpful. Alternatively, 835 divided by 24 is about 34.79. If I subtract 53 from that, 34.79 -53≈-18.21. Then multiply by 98? No, that's negative. Not useful.\n\nWhat if I group operations differently. For example, (835 - 53) = 782. Then 782 divided by something. 782 divided by 24 is approximately 32.58. 32.58*98 would be way too big. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (98 - 53) =45. Then 45*24=1080. Then 1080 - 835=245. Not 339. Alternatively, 835 - (98-53)*24= 835 - 45*24=835-1080= -245. No.\n\nWait, perhaps using division in a different way. Let's see: 835 divided by 5. Let's see, 5*53=265. So 835/5=167. But 167 plus 98 minus 24=241. Not helpful. Wait, but 53 is a prime number here. Maybe using 53 as a multiplier. Let's see: 24 + 98=122. 122*53=6466. That's way too big. 835 minus 6466 is way negative.\n\nAlternatively, 835 - (98 + 24)*53. Let's calculate (98+24)=122. 122*53=6466. 835-6466 is way off. Nope.\n\nHow about multiplication and subtraction. Let's see: 53*24=1272. Then 1272 - 835=437. Then 437 -98=339. Oh wait! That's 53*24 -835 -98=339? Wait, let's check: 53*24=1272. 1272 -835=437. 437-98=339. But here, we used 53,24,835,98. Each number once. So the equation would be 53*24 -835 -98=339. But wait, subtraction is left associative, so the order would matter. Let me write that as (53 * 24) - 835 - 98. Let's compute step by step: 53*24=1272. 1272-835=437. 437-98=339. Yes! That works. So all numbers are used once, each operation is valid, and the result is 339. So the equation is 53*24 - 835 -98 = 339. Let me check again: 53*24=1272. 1272-835=437. 437-98=339. Correct.

So maybe adding instead. Wait, 172 is part of the numbers. Let's think about how to combine them.\n\nMaybe multiply some numbers. Let's see: 40 is a big number. If I multiply 40 by something. 40*5=200, so 40*5.5=220. Hmm. Close. But how to get 5.5 from 4, 14, 172. Not sure. Alternatively, maybe 172 plus 40 is 212. Then I need 10 more. But then I have 4 and 14 left. 14-4=10. So 172 +40 + (14-4)= 212 +10=222. Wait, that works! Let's check:\n\n172 +40 is 212. Then 14-4 is 10. So 212+10=222. But I need to use all numbers exactly once. So the equation would be 172 + 40 + (14 -4) =222. That uses all four numbers once. Let me confirm: 172, 40, 14, and 4. Each used once. Yes. Operations: plus, plus, minus. That's allowed. So the equation is (172 +40) + (14 -4) =222. Or written as 172 +40 +14 -4. Since subtraction and addition are left associative, but the order would still work. Let me compute: 172+40=212; 212+14=226; 226-4=222. Wait, that's different. Wait, wait. Wait, if I do 172 +40 +14 -4: adding 172+40 is 212, then +14 is 226, minus 4 is 222. That works.

So the equation is 172 + 40 + 14 - 4 =222. Alternatively, with parentheses, maybe (172 +40) + (14 -4). Either way, the result is the same. So the answer is 172 + 40 +14 -4.

So maybe I need to subtract or divide those larger numbers to bring them down. Let's list the numbers again: 970, 716, 85, 80. All must be used once.\n\nLet me consider possible operations. Division might be useful here. For example, if I divide 970 by something, maybe. 970 divided by 4 is about 242.5, which is close to 249. Hmm, but how do I get 4? Wait, 85 and 80 could be combined. Let's see: 85 minus 80 is 5. Not 4. Alternatively, 85 divided by 80 is about 1.0625. Not helpful. Maybe 716 divided by something? 716 divided by 3 is around 238.666... Not quite 249. \n\nWait, maybe subtract two large numbers. 970 minus 716 is 254. That's 5 more than 249. How can I adjust that? Maybe subtract 5. Where can I get 5? 85 minus 80 is 5. So 970 - 716 - (85 - 80) = 254 -5 = 249. Let's check that:\n\n970 - 716 = 254. Then 85 -80 =5. Then 254 -5 =249. Yes! That works. Let me write that equation: (970 - 716) - (85 - 80) = 249. But wait, do I need parentheses here? The operations are subtraction, so left to right. But if I write 970 -716 -85 -80, that would be 254 -85=169, then -80=89. Which is wrong.

Let's check 699 - 656 = 43. So if I can make 43 with the remaining numbers 18, 1, 25. But how?\n\nWait, 18, 25, 1. Let me see. 25 + 18 is 43, and then there's the 1 left. If I do 25 + 18 + 1, that's 44. That's too much. Or 25 * 1 is 25, then 25 + 18 is 43. Oh, right! So 25 + 18 + 1 would be 44, but if I can arrange it as 25 * 1 + 18, that's 43. Then adding that to 656 would give 699. Let me check: 656 + (25*1 +18) = 656 + 25 +18 = 656 +43 = 699. Yes! But wait, I need to use all the numbers once. So 25*1 is 25, which uses 25 and 1. Then adding 18 gives 43. Then adding that to 656 gives 699. So the equation would be 656 + (25 * 1) + 18. But does that use all numbers? Let's see: 656, 25, 1, 18. Yes, all four numbers are used. Each operation is allowed. Let me check the arithmetic again. 25*1 is 25, plus 18 is 43. 656 +43 is 699. That works. So the equation is 656 + 25*1 +18. But maybe I need to group them properly.

Oh, wait, that's exactly 320. So if I can somehow get 5 using the remaining numbers 2, 30, and 75, then multiplying by 64 would work. But how?\n\nLet me see. The remaining numbers are 2, 30, 75. How can I make 5 from those? Let's see. 30 divided by something. 30 / 6 is 5. Can I get 6 from 2 and 75? Maybe 75 minus something. 75 - 69 is 6, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, 75 divided by something. 75 / 12.5 is 6, but that's not using 2. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe 2 plus (75 - something). Wait, maybe 30 divided by (75 divided by something). Let's try 30 divided by (75 divided by 15) equals 6, but 15 isn't directly from 2. Alternatively, 75 divided by 25 is 3, but that's not helpful. Wait, maybe subtract: 75 minus 30 is 45. Then 45 plus 2 is 47. Not helpful. Alternatively, 75 minus 30 divided by 2. Let's compute that: (75 - 30)/2 = 45/2 = 22.5. Not 5. \n\nWait, maybe 30 minus (75 divided by something). For example, 30 - (75 / 15) = 30 -5=25. Not helpful. Or 30 - (75/ something). Alternatively, using subtraction and division. Let's think differently. Maybe (75 - 30) is 45. Then 45 divided by something. 45 divided by 9 is 5. How to get 9 from 2? Can't really. 2 multiplied by something. 2*4.5=9. But I don't have 4.5. Alternatively, 2 squared is 4, but exponents might not be allowed. The problem says basic arithmetic operations: +, -, *, /. So exponents are out. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 75 divided by 15 is 5. How to get 15 from 30 and 2. 30 divided by 2 is 15. Oh! Wait, that's possible. So 75 divided by (30 / 2) is 75 /15 =5. Then multiply that by 64.

The problem says each number can only be used once, so I can't reuse them. So operations have to be in a way that uses each number once.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe multiply 12 and 3 to get 36. But where's 3? Wait, can I get a 3 from the other numbers? Let's see. 20 divided by something? 20 divided by (8/2) which is 4, so 20/4=5. Then 12*5=60. Not helpful.\n\nWait, 8 divided by 2 is 4. Then 20 minus 4 is 16. 12 +16=28. No. Not 36.\n\nAlternatively, 12 *3=36. How to get 3? Maybe (20 -8)/ (something). 20-8=12. 12 divided by 2 is 6. Then 6. Hmm, 12* ( (20-8)/2 ) =12*6=72. Again too big.\n\nWait, maybe subtract and multiply. 20 - (12 -8) =20-4=16. Then 16*2=32. Not enough.\n\nHow about (20 +12) =32. Then 32 + (8/2)=32+4=36. Oh! Wait, that uses all numbers: 20 +12 + (8 /2) =32 +4=36. Yes! Let's check: 20,12,8,2. All used once. Operations: +, +, /. That's allowed. So the equation is 20 + 12 + (8 / 2) = 36. Let me verify: 8 divided by 2 is 4, 20+12=32, 32+4=36. Perfect. That works.\n</think>\n\n<answer>20 + 12 + (8 / 2) = 36</answer>"}]}

Let's see.\n\nThe numbers I have are 9, 100, 16, 75. Let me try different combinations. Let's think about combining 100 and 75 first. 100 + 75 is 175. That's bigger than 119. If I subtract something from that. 175 - something = 119. Let's calculate 175 - 119 = 56. So I need to get 56 from 16 and 9. Hmm, 16*3.5 is 56, but I don't have 3.5. Alternatively, 16* (9 - something). Wait, 16 * 3 = 48, which is 56 - 8. Maybe not. Alternatively, 16 + 9 =25. 175 - 25 = 150, which is too much. Hmm, not helpful.\n\nAnother approach: 100 - 75 =25.

Let's check: 9*16=144, then 144 +75=219, then 219 -100=119. But wait, that uses all four numbers: 9,16,75,100. Each once. And operations are * , +, -. Let me verify the calculation:\n\n9 * 16 = 144\n\n144 + 75 = 219\n\n219 - 100 = 119. Yes, that works. So the equation would be (9 * 16) + 75 - 100 = 119. Alternatively, written as 9*16 +75 -100 =119. Since all numbers are used once. Let me check again:\n\n9 is used once, 16 once, 75 once, 100 once. Operations are multiplication, addition, subtraction. Yes. That seems to fit the criteria. Let me make sure there's no order of operations issue. The multiplication happens first, then addition and subtraction left to right. So 9*16=144, then 144+75=219, 219-100=119. Exactly.

I need to create an equation using the numbers 24, 8, 42, and 80 exactly once each, with basic operations, to equal 294. Hmm. Let me start by thinking about the target number, 294. What's 294 close to? Maybe 300 minus 6, or 280 plus 14. Not sure yet. Let's look at the numbers provided: 24, 8, 42, 80.\n\nFirst, I should consider the possible operations. Multiplication and division might help reach a larger number. Let's see, 24 times 8 is 192. That's less than 294. 42 times 8 is 336, which is higher. 80 times 8 is 640, way too big. Alternatively, 80 times 42 is 3360, which is way over. Maybe combinations of multiplication and addition or subtraction.\n\nWait, let's think about 80 and 42. If I subtract them, 80 - 42 = 38, which isn't helpful. Adding them gives 122. Maybe multiply them first. 80 * 42 is 3360. That's way too big. Maybe divide instead. 80 divided by 42 is about 1.904, which isn't useful. How about 42 divided by 8? That's 5.25. Hmm.\n\nLet me try another approach. Let's see if 294 can be broken down into parts that relate to the given numbers. For example, 294 divided by 42 is 7. So maybe if I can get 7 from the other numbers (24, 8, 80) and multiply by 42. Let's see. 24 minus 8 is 16, and 80 divided by 16 is 5. So 5 times 42 would be 210. Not enough. Or maybe 24 divided by 8 is 3, then 80 minus 3 is 77. 77 times 42 is way over. Wait, 77*42=3234, way too big.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 80 plus 24 is 104. 104 minus 8 is 96. 96 times something. But 96*3=288, which is close to 294, but how to get 3 from 42? 42 divided by 14 is 3, but I don't have 14. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe combine multiplication and addition. Let's try 42 * 8 = 336. Then subtract something. 336 - (80 - 24) = 336 - 56 = 280. That's 280, which is 14 less than 294. Not quite. Or 336 + (80 - 24) = 336 + 56 = 392. Too much.\n\nWhat if I do 80 * 3.675 = 294, but where would 3.675 come from? Let's see. Using 24, 8, and 42 to get 3.675. Not sure. Maybe another approach.\n\nHow about 24 * (8 + something) = 294. Let's see: 294 divided by 24 is 12.25. So 8 plus 4.25 would be needed. How to get 4.25 from 42 and 80. Maybe 80 divided by something. 80 divided by 42 is approximately 1.904, so 8 + 1.904 is about 9.904. 24*9.904 is around 237.7. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let's try using 80 and 24 first. 80 - 24 = 56. Then 56 * 5.25 = 294. How to get 5.25 from 8 and 42. 42 divided by 8 is 5.25. So that would be (80 - 24) * (42 / 8) = 56 * 5.25 = 294. Wait, that works! Let me check the numbers: 80, 24, 42, 8. All used once. Operations: subtraction, division, multiplication. So the equation is (80 - 24) * (42 / 8). Let me calculate that again. 80-24=56. 42 divided by 8 is 5.25. 56*5.25=294. Yes, that's correct. So the equation should be (80 - 24) * (42 / 8) = 294.

So I need to combine them with operations in a way that the total is 49.\n\nLet's see... 49 is a bit less than 50. Maybe I can subtract something from a larger number to get 49. Let's look at the larger numbers here: 81, 88, 34. 88 is the biggest. If I subtract something from 88, can that help? 88 minus what? Let's see, 88 - 39 would be 49. But do I have 39? Not directly. But maybe I can make 39 using the other numbers. Wait, I have 34, 81, and 8 left. Hmm, 34 + 8 is 42. Then 81 - 42 is 39. Wait, so 88 - (81 - (34 +8))? Let's compute that step by step.\n\nFirst, 34 + 8 is 42. Then 81 - 42 is 39. Then 88 - 39 equals 49. Yes! That works. Let me check if I used all numbers once. 88, 81, 34, 8. Yes, each is used once. The operations would be: 88 - (81 - (34 + 8)).\n\nLet me compute that again to verify. 34 +8 =42. Then 81 -42=39. Then 88-39=49. Perfect. So the equation would be 88 - (81 - (34 + 8)) =49. Let me write that with parentheses correctly. So it's 88 - (81 - (34 + 8)). That should do it. Let me check once more.\n\nAlternatively, could there be another combination? Let me see. Maybe 81 divided by something. 81 divided by something plus or minus others. But 81/ something... 81 divided by 8 is about 10, but then adding 34 and 88 would be way over. Not helpful. Another approach: 88 is a big number. If I use division, maybe 88 divided by something. 88 divided by 8 is 11. Then 11 times something? 11*4.45... Not sure. 11 +34=45, plus 81 is 126, minus 8 is 118. Not helpful.\n\nAnother way: 34 -8 =26. Then 81 -26=55. 55 + something? 88-55=33. Not 49. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, 81 -34=47. Then 88 divided by 8=11. 47 +11=58. Not 49.\n\nWait, maybe 34 +8=42. Then 88 -42=46. 81 -46=35. No. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 88 -81=7. Then 34 -8=26. 7*26=182. Nope.\n\nWait, let's go back to the first idea. The first equation I came up with: 88 - (81 - (34 +8)). Let me check again. 34+8=42. 81-42=39. 88-39=49. That works. So that uses all numbers once. The operations are subtraction and addition.

Not 4. Hmm. Maybe another approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe subtract two numbers to get a smaller number. For example, 49 - 34 = 15. Then if I can use that with others.

I need to create an equation using the numbers 67, 699, 1, 5, each exactly once, and the result should be 771. The operations allowed are +, -, *, /. Hmm, let's start by looking at the numbers. The biggest number here is 699, so maybe I can use that as a base. Let's see, 771 is larger than 699, so maybe adding something to 699 would get close. 699 plus what? Let's calculate 771 minus 699, which is 72. So I need to make 72 from the remaining numbers: 67, 1, and 5. Wait, 67, 1, 5. Hmm. Let's see. 67 plus 5 is 72, and then adding 1 would be 73, which is too much. But maybe there's a way to subtract. If I do 67 + 5 = 72, then 72 - 1 = 71. That's not enough. Alternatively, 67 * 1 = 67, then 67 +5=72. Oh, but that uses 1 and 5. Wait, if I do 67 + (5 * 1), that's 72. But that uses multiplication. So then 699 + 67 + (5*1) = 699 + 67 +5 = 771. Wait, let me check that. 699 + 67 is 766, then 766 +5 is 771. But wait, that uses 699, 67, 5, and 1. So that's all four numbers. But the operations are 699 + 67 +5*1. Wait, but 5*1 is just 5. So maybe 699 + 67 +5 +1? But that would be 699 +67=766, then 766+5=771, then +1 would make 772. So that's over. Wait, maybe I need to use multiplication or division to combine the numbers better. Let's think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe subtract something from 699 to get 771. Wait, but 699 is less than 771, so subtracting would make it smaller. Not helpful. So adding to 699 is the way. So 699 plus something equals 771. That something is 72. So how to get 72 from 67, 5, 1. Let's see. 67 +5=72, but then where does the 1 go? Because we have to use all numbers. Wait, but if we use 1 as a multiplier, like 5*1=5, then 67 +5*1=72. Then 699 +72=771. So that works. Let's check: 699 + (67 +5*1) = 699 + (67+5) = 699 +72 = 771. Yes! Because 5*1 is 5, so 67 +5 is 72. Then adding that to 699 gives 771. And all numbers are used: 699, 67,5,1. So the equation would be 699 + 67 +5*1 = 771. Or maybe written as 699 +67 + (5*1) = 771. But since multiplication has higher precedence, the parentheses aren't necessary. Alternatively, maybe 699 + (67 +5) *1. But that would be 699 +72*1, which is 771. But that also works. Wait, but 67 +5 is 72, then multiplied by 1, but that would still be 72. Then 699 +72=771. But in that case, the equation would be 699 + (67 +5) *1. But here, the multiplication by 1 is redundant. So either way. So the equation can be written as 699 +67 +5×1. Let me check the arithmetic again. 5×1=5, 67+5=72, 699+72=771. Perfect. So that uses all numbers once with +, +, and × operations. So that should work.\n</think>\n\n<answer>699 + 67 + 5 * 1 = 771</answer>"}]}

Alternatively, maybe 71 times 10 is 710, which is very close. But how to get 10 from the remaining numbers: 23, 57, 97. Let's see. 57 minus 23 is 34, 57 divided by 23 is about 2.478, not helpful. Maybe 97 minus 57 is 40. Hmm. Maybe subtract 40 from 71*10? Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe I can combine 97 and 71. Let's try 97 + 71 = 168. Then 168 multiplied by something. Let's see, 713 divided by 168 is about 4.24. So maybe 168 times 4.24... Not helpful. Alternatively, 97 multiplied by 71 is way too big. 97*71 = 6887. That's way over. So maybe division? 97 divided by 71 is about 1.366. Not helpful.\n\nWhat about 57 and 23? 57 -23 =34. 34 times 21 is 714, which is close. But how to get 21 from the other numbers. Wait, 97 and 71: 97 -71=26. Not 21. Alternatively, 71 -23=48. Not sure.\n\nAnother approach: 713 divided by 23 is about 31. So maybe 23 multiplied by 31 equals 713. How to get 31 from 71, 57, 97. Let's see. 97 minus 57 is 40. 40 minus 9 is 31, but where's 9? Alternatively, 71 divided by something. 71/ (97-57) is 71/40=1.775. Not helpful. Wait, 57 minus 26 is 31. But how to get 26 from the remaining numbers. 97-71=26. So 57 - (97-71) = 57 -26=31. Then 23*31=713. So putting it all together: 23*(57 - (97 -71)) = 23*(57-26)=23*31=713. But wait, let's check if all numbers are used. 23 is used, 57, 97, 71. Yes, all four numbers are used once. So that works. Let me verify the calculation:\n\nFirst, 97 -71 =26. Then 57 -26=31. Then 23*31=713. Yes! So the equation is 23*(57 - (97 -71)) =713. That uses all numbers once with the required operations.\n</think>\n\n<answer>23 * (57 - (97 - 71)) = 713</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using the numbers 56, 81, 14, and 4 exactly once each, with basic operations, to get 866. Hmm. 866 is a pretty big number, so I probably need to multiply some of the larger numbers together. Let me start by thinking about the possible combinations.\n\nFirst, the largest numbers here are 81 and 56. If I multiply those, 81*56 is... let's calculate that. 80*56 is 4480, plus 1*56 is 56, so total 4536. That's way too big. But maybe if I subtract something from that product? But 4536 minus anything here (like 14 and 4) would still be way over. So maybe multiplying isn't the right approach with those two.\n\nWait, maybe combining them with addition first. 81 + 56 is 137. Then multiply by something else. Let's see, 137 * 14 would be... 100*14=1400, 37*14=518, so total 1918. Still not enough. Then subtract 4? No, 1918-4=1914. Not 866. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using division to get a higher number. Let's see, 81 divided by something. 81/4 is 20.25. Then multiply by 56? 20.25*56 = let's see, 20*56=1120, 0.25*56=14, so 1120+14=1134. Still not 866. If I subtract 14 from that, 1134-14=1120. Not helpful.\n\nWhat about 56 divided by 4? That's 14. Then maybe 81*14 +14? Wait, but 14 is already used as 56/4. Wait, but we have to use all four numbers once each. So if I use 56/4 to get 14, then I can't use the original 14. Because each number can only be used once. Oh right, so that's a problem. So I can't do 56/4 and then also use 14. So that approach is invalid.\n\nHmm. Maybe another way. Let's think about subtraction. What if we do 81*14 to get a big number. 81*14 is 1134. Then subtract something. 1134 - 56*4. Let's calculate 56*4 is 224. 1134-224=910. Still not 866. Then maybe 81*14 - 56*4 - something else? But we've already used all numbers except maybe the 4? Wait, no, we used 81,14,56,4 in that case. So all numbers are used. So 1134-224=910. Not 866. Hmm.\n\nWait, 866 is between 800 and 900. Maybe try 81* something. Let's see. 81*10 is 810. Then 810 plus 56 is 866. But where do the 14 and 4 come in? Oh, but we need to use all numbers. So perhaps 81*10 +56, but how to get 10 from 14 and 4. 14-4=10. So maybe 81*(14-4) +56. Let's check. 14-4=10. 81*10=810. 810+56=866. Yes! That works. Let me verify the numbers used: 81,14,4,56. All used once. The operations are subtraction, multiplication, and addition. That should do it.\n</think>\n\n<answer>81 * (14 - 4) + 56</answer>"}]}

Let's see if I can get close to that. The numbers I have are 5, 80, 6, and 54. Let's see the possible combinations.\n\nLooking at 80 and 54, they're the largest numbers here. If I subtract them, 80 - 54 = 26. That doesn't seem helpful. If I add them, 80 + 54 = 134. Still not close to 352. What if I multiply them? 80 * 54 is 4320, which is way too big. Maybe that's too much. Division would be 80/54 ≈ 1.48, which isn't helpful.\n\nWait, maybe I should pair the numbers differently. Let's see. 5 and 6 are smaller. 5*6=30. Then maybe 30 with the others. 30 + 80 = 110, then 110 +54=164. No, not enough. Alternatively, 30* something. 30*54 would be 1620, which is way over. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, 80 -5=75, 75*6=450.

Oh, wait, that works. Let me check: 80*5=400. Then subtract (54-6). 54-6 is 48. 400-48=352. But wait, that uses 80,5,54,6. All numbers used once. So the equation would be 80*5 - (54 -6) = 352. Let me verify:\n\n80 multiplied by 5 is 400. 54 minus 6 is 48. 400 minus 48 is indeed 352. Yes! So that works. The equation would be (80 * 5) - (54 - 6) = 352.

I need to create an equation using the numbers 14, 15, 28, and 1 exactly once each, with basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) any number of times, to equal 602. Hmm, 602 is a pretty big number, so probably multiplication is involved here. Let me start by looking at the numbers given: 14, 15, 28, 1. \n\nFirst, let me check the possible products. If I multiply the two largest numbers, 28 and 15, that gives 420. Then maybe add 14 and 1? But 420 +14 +1 = 435, which is way too low. Hmm, that's not enough.\n\nWait, maybe I need to multiply more numbers. Let's see: 28 * 15 is 420. If I can use the other two numbers (14 and 1) in a way that adds up to 602. So 420 + something = 602. The difference here is 602 - 420 = 182. How can I get 182 from 14 and 1? That seems difficult. 14 * 13 = 182, but I don't have 13. Alternatively, 14 + 1 =15, which isn't helpful. Hmm, not sure. Maybe that approach isn't right.\n\nAlternatively, could I do 28 multiplied by something else? Let's see. 28 * 14 is 392. Then if I have 15 and 1 left. 392 +15 +1 = 408. Still too low. If I multiply 392 by something, but I can't reuse numbers. Wait, maybe 28 * (14 + something) to get a bigger number. Let's try 28*(14 +15) = 28*29 = 812. Then subtract 1? 812 -1 = 811. Not 602. No.\n\nWhat if I do 15 * 28 =420 again. Then maybe 14 * something. Wait, 14 * 43 is 602. So can I make 43 from 15, 28, 1? Let's see. 28 +15 =43, but then I have 1 left. If I use 28 +15, that's 43, but then I can't use the 1. Wait, but I have to use all numbers. So maybe 14*(15 + 28) +1. Let's compute that: 14*(43) = 602, then +1 would be 603. That's over by 1. Alternatively, 14*(15 +28) -1 = 602 -1=601. Hmm, close but not exactly. Oh wait, 14*(15+28) is 14*43=602. Wait, that's exactly 602. Wait, but then where does the 1 come in? Because all numbers must be used. Oh, right, in that case, if I use 14*(15+28) = 14*43=602, but then I haven't used the 1. So that's a problem. So I need to find a way to include the 1 somehow.\n\nSo maybe I need to adjust the equation. Let's think: 14, 15, 28, 1. Let's see. Maybe use division or subtraction to incorporate the 1. For example, 28*15 +14*1 = 420 +14 =434. Not enough. 28*15*1 +14 =420 +14=434. Still not. How about (28 +1)*15 +14= 29*15=435 +14=449. No. Not close.\n\nAlternatively, 28*(15 +14) +1. Let's compute: 28*29=812 +1=813. No. Not helpful.\n\nHmm, maybe subtraction. 28*15* something. Wait, 28*15 is 420. If we can multiply that by something. But then we have to use the remaining numbers 14 and 1. Wait, 420 * (14 /1) = 420*14=5880. Way too big. No.\n\nWait, perhaps 28* (15 + (14*1)). Let's compute inside:14*1=14. 15+14=29. 28*29=812. Not 602.\n\nAlternatively, 15*(28 +14) +1. 15*42=630 +1=631. No. Not 602.\n\nWait, 602 divided by 14 is 43. So maybe if I can get 43 using the other numbers. 15 +28 +1=44. Close. 44-1=43. So 14*(15 +28 -1). Let's check: 15+28=43, 43-1=42. 14*42=588. Not 602. Hmm.\n\nWait, 14*(15 +28) =14*43=602. But then where's the 1? Oh, because all numbers must be used. So if I have 14*(15+28) but then the 1 is unused. So that's a problem. So maybe we can find a way to include the 1 in a way that doesn't change the result. For example, multiplying by 1, or adding zero. But adding zero would require 1-1, which isn't possible since we can only use 1 once. Alternatively, dividing by 1. If we can divide something by 1, which doesn't change the value. So maybe 14*(15+28) + (1-1), but that uses 1 twice. Not allowed. Wait, but we need to use each number once.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (14 +1) * (28 +15). Wait, 15*43=645. Not 602. Hmm.\n\nWait, 28*14=392. 15*1=15. 392 +15=407. No. 28*15=420. 14*1=14. 420+14=434. No. Not close.\n\nAlternatively, 28*(15 - (14/1)). Let's compute:14/1=14. 15-14=1. 28*1=28. Not helpful.\n\nHmm. Maybe using division in a different way. Let's see. Let's try 28 divided by something. For example, 28/(1) =28. Then 28*15 +14=434. Still not.\n\nWait, maybe (15 -1)*14 +28. Let's compute:14*14=196 +28=224. Not 602.\n\nAlternatively, 28*15 +14*1=420 +14=434. Still no.\n\nWait, 28*21.5 is 602. But how do I get 21.5 from the numbers. But since we have to use integers. Wait, maybe with division. Let's see. For example, 28*(15 + (14/1))? No, 14/1=14, 15+14=29, 28*29=812. Not.\n\nWait, what if we do (28 +15) * (14 -1). Let's compute:43*13=559. Not 602.\n\nHmm. What if we have 28*(15 +1) +14. That's 28*16=448 +14=462. No.\n\nAlternatively, (15*14) +28*1. 210 +28=238. No.\n\nWait, maybe 14*15=210. 28*1=28. 210 +28=238. Still not. \n\nI'm stuck. Let me try a different approach. Let's see the target is 602. Let's factorize 602. 602 divided by 2 is 301. 301 is a prime number? Let me check. 301 divided by 7 is 43. So 7*43=301. So 602 is 2*7*43. But the numbers given are 14,15,28,1. Let's see if we can use these factors. 14 is 2*7, 28 is 2*14, 15 is 3*5, and 1. So perhaps 14*(something). 14*43=602. So if we can make 43 from 15,28,1. Let's see. 28 +15=43, but then we have 1 left. Wait, but if we do 14*(28 +15) =14*43=602, then 1 is unused. So how can we incorporate 1?\n\nWait, maybe 14*(28 +15) +1 -1. But that uses 1 twice. Not allowed. Alternatively, maybe 14*(28 +15) * (1). But that uses 1, but multiplying by 1 doesn't change the value. Wait, that's allowed. So 14*(28+15)*1. Let's compute: 14*43*1=602. But is that acceptable? Because we are using each number once. Let me check: 14, 28,15,1. All are used once. The operations are + and * and implicit *1. Wait, but how is that structured. Let's write the equation: 14 * (28 +15) * 1. Yes, that uses all numbers. The operations are + and *, and each number is used once. Let me check the calculation: 28+15=43; 43*14=602; 602*1=602. So that works. Wait, but in the problem statement, do we have to use all numbers once? Yes. So this equation would be 14*(28 +15)*1 =602. That uses all numbers once. So maybe that's the answer. Let me check again. \n\nYes, 14*(28+15)*1. Let's break it down:\n\n- 28 +15 =43\n\n- 43*14=602\n\n- 602*1=602\n\nSo that's correct. Each number is used once, and the operations are +, *, * (though technically, multiplying by 1 is redundant, but allowed). So this would be the equation: (28 +15) *14 *1. So in equation form, that's (28 +15) *14 *1. Or maybe 14*(28+15)*1. Either way, as long as all numbers are used once. Let me check if the order of operations matters, but multiplication is associative and commutative, so the parentheses are okay. So yes, this should be correct.\n</think>\n\n<answer>14 * (28 + 15) * 1</answer>"}]}

Specifically, 2^9 is 512. So maybe I can find a way to get exponents involved through multiplication or division. But the problem says basic operations, so exponents might not be allowed unless implied through multiplication. Wait, the user said \"basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /)\" so exponentiation isn't allowed. So I need to use those operations.\n\nLet me list the numbers: 26, 855, 63, 55. All must be used once. Let's see. Maybe start by looking for pairs that can combine into numbers close to 512 or factors of 512.\n\nLooking at 855 and 63. If I subtract 63 from 855, that's 792. Hmm, 792 is still bigger than 512. Alternatively, 855 divided by 63 is approximately 13.57. Not helpful. What if I multiply 63 and 55? 63*55=3465. That's way too big. Maybe subtract: 855 - 55 = 800. Then 800 minus 26 is 774. Still too big. Not helpful.\n\nWait, 512 is 8*64, or 16*32. Let me see if I can get 64 from some combination. For example, 55 + 26 = 81. 81 is 9^2, but not sure. How about 63 divided by something? 63/55 is about 1.145, not helpful. 26 divided by 55 is about 0.47. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, 855 divided by something. Let's try 855 divided by 55. 855 / 55 ≈ 15.545. Then 26 times that? 26 * 15.545 ≈ 404.17. Not close. Alternatively, 855 divided by 26. That's approximately 32.88. Oh, 32 is close to 32.88. Wait, 32 is 2^5. 512 is 2^9. If I can get 32 and 16, but maybe 855/26 is about 32.88. If I subtract something from that. For example, (855/26) - (63/55). Let me compute that. 855 divided by 26 is 32.8846... 63 divided by 55 is 1.145... So 32.8846 - 1.145 ≈ 31.739. Not 32. Maybe not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe using multiplication and division. Let's think about 855 divided by something. If I can get 512 by combining these numbers. Let me see, 512 times 55 is 28160. If I can get 28160 from 855 and 63 and 26. But that seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe 26 times 55 is 1430. Then 1430 minus 855 is 575. Still not 512. 575 minus 63 is 512. Wait, wait: 26 * 55 = 1430. 1430 - 855 = 575. 575 - 63 = 512. But that uses 26, 55, 855, 63. All four numbers. So that would be 26*55 - 855 - 63 = 512. Let me check:\n\n26*55 = 1430\n\n1430 - 855 = 575\n\n575 - 63 = 512. Yes! That works. So the equation would be (26 * 55) - 855 - 63 = 512. Let me verify all numbers are used once: 26, 55, 855, 63. Yes, all used. The operations are multiplication and subtraction. So this seems to fit. But wait, the problem says \"create an equation\" so we need to use each number once. Let me check again:\n\n26 * 55 = 1430\n\n1430 - 855 = 575\n\n575 - 63 = 512. So all four numbers are used, each once. The operations are *, -, -.\n\nTherefore, the equation is (26 × 55) − 855 − 63 = 512.

Let's try 322 - 75 = 247. That's 12 more than 235. Hmm, maybe I can adjust that. What if I subtract more? But I have to use all numbers. So maybe 322 - (something involving 257, 4, and 75). Wait, maybe I need to combine them in a different way.\n\nAlternatively, 257 is close to 235. If I can get from 257 to 235 by subtracting something. 257 - 22 = 235. But how to get 22 from the remaining numbers: 322, 4, and 75. That might not be straightforward. Alternatively, 257 - (something) = 235. So that something would be 22. Let's see. 75 divided by something? 75/4 is 18.75. Not 22. 322 minus 300? But how to get 300 from others. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe use multiplication. Let's see. 75 * 4 is 300. Then 322 - 300 is 22. So 257 - (322 - 75*4) = 257 - (322 - 300) = 257 -22 = 235. But wait, does that use all numbers? Let's check. 75,4 are multiplied, 322 is used in the subtraction, and 257. So yes, all numbers are used once. Let's write that as an equation: 257 - (322 - 75 * 4) = 235. Let's compute that step by step. 75*4=300. 322-300=22. 257-22=235. Yes, that works!\n\nBut wait, the problem says you can use the operations multiple times but each number only once. So in this case, 75 and 4 are multiplied, 322 is subtracted, and 257 is the main number. All numbers are used once. So this equation should be valid. Let me check again: 75 * 4 = 300. Then 322 - 300 = 22. Then 257 - 22 = 235. Yes. So the equation would be 257 - (322 - 75 * 4) = 235. But we need to present it with the numbers and operations in order, using each once. Let's see. So the numbers used are 257, 322, 75, 4. Each once. The operations are multiplication, subtraction, and another subtraction. So that's allowed. So the equation is (257 - (322 - 75 * 4)) = 235. Alternatively, maybe 75*4 is written first, but the order is acceptable as long as all numbers are used once. Let me confirm the arithmetic again: 75 *4 is 300. 322 - 300 is 22. 257 -22 is 235. Yep. So this works. I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\n<answer>257 - (322 - 75 * 4) = 235</answer>"}]}

Hmm, so first I need to remember that I can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Let's see... 842 is a pretty large number, so maybe multiplication will be involved here. Let me start by looking at the numbers and see how they can combine.\n\nThe numbers I have are 33, 40, 63, and 415. The largest number is 415, so maybe that's a good starting point. If I can multiply 415 by something to get close to 842. Let's check: 415 * 2 = 830. That's close, but 830 is 12 less than 842. But I don't have a 2, though. Wait, maybe I can get 2 from other numbers. Let's see, 40 divided by something? If I take 40 and divide by 33, that's about 1.212, which isn't 2. Maybe 63 divided by something? 63 divided by 33 is about 1.909. Hmm, not quite. Alternatively, maybe subtraction. 63 - 40 = 23. Then 415 * 2 + 23? But I can't use 2 again. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe combine the numbers in a different way. Let's think about 415 plus some other numbers. 415 + 63 = 478. Then 40 * 33 is 1320. 1320 - 478 = 842? Let me check: 40*33 is 1320. Then subtract 415 and 63: 1320 - 415 = 905, then 905 - 63 = 842. Wait, that works! Let me verify:\n\n40 multiplied by 33 is 1320. Then subtract 415 and 63. So 1320 - 415 = 905, and 905 - 63 = 842. But wait, the numbers used would be 40, 33, 415, 63. All of them are used once. So the equation would be 40*33 - 415 - 63 = 842. Let me compute step by step:\n\n40 * 33 = 1320.\n\n1320 - 415 = 905.\n\n905 - 63 = 842. Yep, that's correct. So the equation is (40 * 33) - 415 - 63 = 842. But since all operations are subtraction and multiplication, the parentheses might not be necessary. Alternatively, it can be written as 40*33 - 415 -63. Let me check if that's allowed. Since multiplication comes before subtraction, the order of operations would handle it. So 40*33 is calculated first, then subtract 415 and 63. Yes. So that's a valid equation using all numbers once. Let me make sure there's no other combination, but this seems to work. Let me try another way just to be sure. Maybe 63* something? 63*13 is 819, which is close to 842 but 23 away. 415 - 40 = 375. 375 + 63 = 438. 438 * 2 would be 876. Doesn't help. Alternatively, 415 + 63 = 478, 40*33=1320, 1320 - 478 = 842, same as before. So yeah, this seems to be the correct equation.\n</think>\n\n<answer>40 * 33 - 415 - 63 = 842</answer>"}]}

I need to use all the numbers 13, 99, 85, and 89 exactly once each, along with basic arithmetic operations, to get 975. Hmm.

The largest numbers here are 99, 89, 85, and 13. 99 is the biggest. Maybe multiplying some of the larger numbers could get close. Let's see:\n\n99 multiplied by something. Let's see 99*10 is 990, which is close to 975. But how to get 10? Wait, maybe 99*9.8... but that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe combining 85 and 89 in some way. Let me try to see:\n\n99 * 85 = 8415, which is way too big. 99 * 89 = 8811, also way too big. So maybe that's not the way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps subtract or add numbers first. Let's think: 99 + 85 = 184, 89 -13=76. Then 184 * 76 is 13984, which is way over. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe dividing? If I can divide a large number by something to get a part of 975. Hmm. Let's see 975 divided by 99 is about 9.848. Not helpful. 975 divided by 85 is 11.47. Hmm, maybe 85 multiplied by something. 85*11 is 935, which is close to 975. 85*11.47 is 975. So maybe 85 multiplied by (something) equals 975. But I need to use all the numbers.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about 975 as 13 * 75. Since 13 is one of the numbers. So if I can get 75 from 99, 85, 89. Let's see: 99 - (85 - 89/13) but that seems complicated. Wait, 99 - (something) equals 75. 99 -24 =75. How to get 24 from 85 and 89? Hmm, 89 -85=4. Then 24 is 6*4, but I don't have a 6. Alternatively, 85 - (89/ something). But 89 divided by 13 is about 6.84. 85 minus that is 78.16. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe 85 - (something) =75. Then that would be 85 -10=75. How to get 10 from 99 and 89. 99 -89=10. So 85 - (99 -89) =85 -10=75. Then 13 *75=975. That uses all numbers. Let's check:\n\n13 * (85 - (99 -89)) = 13*(85 -10)=13*75=975. Yes! So that's the equation. Let me verify each step:\n\n99 -89=10. Then 85-10=75. Then 13*75=975. All numbers used once each. Operations are subtraction and multiplication. So the equation is 13*(85 - (99 -89))=975.\n</think>\n\n<answer>13 * (85 - (99 - 89)) = 975</answer>"}]}

Let me think about possible operations.\n\nFirst, 544 is a pretty big number. Let me check what 544 divided by some of these numbers gives. For example, 544 ÷ 17 is 32. So maybe if I can get 32 from the other numbers. The other numbers are 11 and 60. Wait, 60 minus 11 is 49, which isn't helpful. Alternatively, 60 divided by something? 60 divided by (17 - 11) would be 60/6=10. Then 10 times 17 is 170, not 544. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe multiply larger numbers first. Let's see, 17 times 60 is 1020. Then subtract something. If I have 1020 - (17 + 11) that's 1020 - 28 = 992. Not 544. Maybe 17*60=1020, then divide by something. But then I have 17 left and 11. Wait, maybe 1020 divided by (17 - 11) which is 6, gives 170. 170 times 3.2? But I don't have 3.2. Maybe not.\n\nWait, 11 times 60 is 660. Then 660 minus 17 minus 17 is 660 -34 = 626. Still not 544. Hmm.\n\nWait, 17 multiplied by 32 is 544. How can I get 32 from 11, 60, and 17? Let's see. 60 minus 28 is 32. But how to get 28? 11 plus 17 is 28. So 60 - (11 +17) =32. Then 17*32. But I have two 17s. Wait, but each number can be used only once. So I need to use both 17s. Let's see: 17 * (60 - (11 + 17)) = 17 * (60 -28)=17*32=544. But wait, that uses both 17s: one inside the parentheses and one outside. Wait, the numbers given are 17,11,60,17. So each 17 is a separate number. So in this equation, the first 17 is used as the multiplier, and the other 17 is used inside the parentheses. So each 17 is used once. That would work. Let's check:\n\n17 * (60 - (11 + 17)) = 17*(60-28)=17*32=544. Yes! That uses all four numbers: 17, 60, 11, and 17. Each once. So the equation is 17*(60 - (11 +17)) =544.\n\nLet me verify the arithmetic:\n\n11 +17=28\n\n60-28=32\n\n17*32=544. Yep, that's correct. So the equation is 17×(60 − (11 +17)) =544. So the answer would be (17 * (60 - (11 + 17))) =544. But since we need to write the equation, maybe parenthesize properly. Let me check the order of operations. The inner parentheses first: 11 +17=28. Then 60-28=32. Then 17*32=544. So the equation is 17*(60 -11 -17). Wait, since addition is commutative, maybe write it as 17*(60 - (11 +17)). Either way. But in the problem statement, the numbers are given as 17,11,60,17. So in the equation, the two 17s are used: one as the first number and the other inside the subtraction. So that uses all four numbers once each. Perfect.\n</think>\n\n<answer>17 * (60 - 11 - 17) = 544</answer>"}]}

Let me start by thinking about how these numbers can combine.\n\nFirst, 460 is a bit over 400, so maybe there's a multiplication involved that gets close. Let's see, 52 is a big number. If I multiply 52 by something. 52 * 9 would be 468, which is close to 460, but I don't have a 9. Hmm. Wait, but maybe I can make 9 from the other numbers. Let's see, 63 divided by 7 is 9, but 7 isn't available. Wait, the other numbers are 4, 1, and 63. Wait, 63 divided by (4 + something). Let me check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 52 multiplied by 4 is 208. Then, 208 plus 63 is 271. Then adding 1 gives 272. Not enough. That's not close. Hmm. Maybe subtract instead. 52 * 4 = 208, 208 + 63 = 271, then 271 -1 = 270. Still not 460.\n\nWait, maybe 63 and 4 can be used in a way that gives a larger number. For example, 63 * 4 is 252. Then 252 plus 52 is 304. Then 304 plus 1 is 305. Still not enough. Alternatively, 63 * (4 + 1) = 63*5=315. Then 315 +52=367. Still too low.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe using division to get a larger number. For example, 63 divided by something. Wait, 63 divided by 1 is 63. Then 63 * 4 = 252. 252 +52=304. Still not 460.\n\nWhat if I subtract first? 63 - 1 = 62. Then 62 *4=248. 248 +52=300. Nope. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 52 + 63 = 115. Then multiply by 4: 115 *4=460. Wait, that's exactly 460! Wait, but then I need to use all numbers, including the 1. Oh, but in that case, 115*4 is 460, but how to include the 1? Because if I do (52 +63) *4, that's 115*4=460. But then I haven't used the 1. So that's a problem.\n\nSo close! But the 1 is left. Maybe find a way to incorporate the 1 without changing the result. For example, multiply by (4 +1 -1) or something. But that's using 4,1, but maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps use 1 in a division that doesn't affect the outcome. For instance, 52 +63 =115. Then 115 * (4 /1) =115*4=460. Wait, that's possible! Let me check: 4 divided by 1 is 4. So (52 +63) * (4 /1) =115 *4=460. But does that use all numbers? Yes: 52, 63, 4, 1. Each once. So that works. Wait, that might be the answer. Let me verify:\n\n52 +63 =115\n\n4 divided by 1 is 4.\n\nMultiply them: 115*4=460. Yes!\n\nSo the equation would be (52 + 63) * (4 / 1) =460.\n\nYes, that uses all numbers once. So that's the solution. I think that works. Let me make sure there's no order of operations issue. The parentheses would ensure that the addition and division happen first, then the multiplication. Correct.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(52 + 63) * (4 / 1)</answer>"}]}

Let's see if multiplying some of the larger numbers can get close. For example, 53 and 29 are the two biggest numbers here. 53 multiplied by 29 is 53*29.

Let's try 53*14=742. Then if I divide by 14... Wait, but 14 is already used. Oh right, all numbers must be used once. So maybe (53 * 14) + (39 - 29) = 742 + 10 = 752. No. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 53 * (39 - 14) = 53*25=1325. Then subtract 29: 1296. Still too high. Hmm.\n\nWhat if we do 39 * 14 = 546. Then subtract 53 - 29 = 24. So 546 -24=522. Close to 498, but still 24 away. Not quite.\n\nWait, maybe 53* (14 + 39). Let's check: 14+39=53. Then 53*53=2809. That's way too big. Not helpful.\n\nHow about 53*9.6. Wait, but we have to use the numbers as integers. Maybe division. Let's see. Suppose I do 53 * (39 / 14). That's 53*(2.7857...) which is approximately 147.6. Then subtract 29: 118.6. Not even close.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (53 - 29) * something. 53-29=24. Then 24*14=336. Add 39: 375. Still low.\n\nWait, maybe 29 * 14 is 406. Then 498 - 406 = 92. So need to get 92 from 53 and 39. 53 +39=92. So 29*14 +53 +39 =406+92=498. But wait, that uses all numbers: 29,14,53,39. Let me check: 29*14=406; 53+39=92; 406+92=498. Yes! So the equation is (29 * 14) + (53 + 39) = 498. But let me verify the arithmetic again to make sure. 29*14: 20*14=280, 9*14=126, total 280+126=406. 53+39=92. 406+92=498. Perfect.

If I multiply 50 by something, that could get me close. Let's see, 50 times 10 is 500. But I need to get 10 from the other numbers: 9, 37, and 56.

Let me try a different approach.\n\nWhat if I use 50 and 9 first. 50*9 is 450. Then I need 50 more. How can I get 50 from 37 and 56? 56 -37 is 19. So 450 +19 is 469. Not enough.

So how to make 10 using 9,37,56. Let's see. 56-37=19, then 19-9=10. So 50*(56-37-9). Let's check that: 56-37=19, 19-9=10. Then 50*10=500. Yes! That uses all numbers: 50, 56,37,9. The equation would be 50*(56 -37 -9) = 50*(10)=500. Let me check: 56-37 is 19, minus 9 is 10. 50*10=500. Perfect. So the equation is 50*(56 -37 -9) = 500. But wait, do I need to use all the operations only once? No, the operations can be used multiple times. Each number is used once. So that should work. Let me double-check the numbers: 50, 56,37,9 are all used. The operations are subtraction twice and multiplication once. Yep, that fits the criteria.\n</think>\n\n<answer>50 * (56 - 37 - 9) = 500</answer>"}]}

I need to make an equation using 12, 18, 35, and 59 with each number used exactly once, and the result should be 761. Hmm. The operations allowed are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. \n\nFirst, I should think about the target number, 761. It's a relatively large number, so maybe multiplication will be involved here. Let's consider the largest numbers in the set: 59 and 35. If I multiply those two, 59*35 is 2065. That's way bigger than 761. But maybe if I subtract something from that product? Let's see: 2065 - (12 + 18) = 2065 - 30 = 2035. Still way too big. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can combine 59 with one of the smaller numbers first. Let's see. 59*12 is 708. Then 761 - 708 is 53. But I have 18 and 35 left. How can I get 53 from 18 and 35? 35 + 18 is 53. So maybe 59*12 + 35 + 18 = 708 + 35 +18 = 761. Wait, let me check that: 708 + 35 is 743, plus 18 is 761. Yes! So that works. But wait, does that use all numbers once? 12, 18, 35, 59. Yes, each used once. So the equation would be 59*12 + 35 + 18 = 761. Let me write that as (59*12) + 35 + 18. Let me check again: 59 times 12 is 708. Then 708 plus 35 is 743. 743 plus 18 is 761. Perfect. That seems to work. But wait, the problem says \"create an equation\" so maybe I need to structure it with parentheses properly. Let me make sure the order of operations is correct. Since multiplication comes first, 59*12 is calculated first, then adding 35 and 18. So the equation is correct. So maybe the answer is (59*12) + 35 + 18. But let me check if there's another way, perhaps using division or subtraction. For example, maybe combining 35 and 18 in some way. Like 35*18=630. Then 630 plus something. 630 + 59 +12=630+71=701. Not enough. If we subtract instead: 630 -59 -12=630-71=559. Not helpful. Alternatively, 59*(35-18) +12. Let's see: 35-18 is 17. 59*17=1003. 1003+12=1015. No. Not close. Another approach: 35*18=630. Then 630 + 59*12=630 +708=1338. That's way over. Hmm. What about division? Maybe 59 divided by something. For example, 59/(12-18) but that would be negative, which complicates things. Maybe 35 divided by something. Let's see. 35/12 is about 2.916. Then 59 * (35/12) +18. Let's compute that: 59*(35/12)=59*2.916≈172. Then 172+18=190. Not close. How about 59*(18+35) -12. Let's compute 18+35=53. 59*53=3127. 3127-12=3115. Too big. Alternatively, 59*12 is 708. Then 708 - (35 -18). 35-18=17. 708-17=691. Still not 761. Hmm. Wait, maybe 59*12 +35*18? 59*12=708, 35*18=630. 708+630=1338. No. Alternatively, 59*(18+12) +35. 18+12=30. 59*30=1770. 1770+35=1805. Nope. \n\nAlternatively, maybe (59 +35) * (18 -12). That's 94 *6=564. Not enough. Or (59-35)*(18+12)=24*30=720. 720 is still under 761. Then 720 + something. But we already used all numbers. Wait, no: 59-35 uses 59 and 35. 18+12 uses 18 and 12. So all numbers are used. So 24*30=720. That's 720. How to get from 720 to 761? But we can't add or subtract anything else because all numbers are used. So that approach doesn't work. \n\nAnother idea: 59* (35 - (18/12)). Let's compute 18/12=1.5. So 35-1.5=33.5. 59*33.5=1976.5. Then subtract something? But we can't, since we've used all numbers. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe 59*12 is 708, then 35*18 is 630. Then 708 + 630 =1338. Then 1338 divided by something. But division here would require using another number, but they're already used. Not helpful. \n\nWait, the initial idea I had was 59*12 +35 +18=761. Let me confirm that again. 59*12 is 708. Then 708 +35 is 743. 743 +18=761. Yes. That works, uses all numbers once. So the equation is 59×12 +35 +18 =761. So the answer would be (59*12) + 35 + 18. Let me check if parentheses are needed. Since multiplication is done before addition, the equation is correct. So the equation is valid. I think that's the correct solution.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(59 * 12) + 35 + 18</answer>"}]}

Let me start by thinking about possible combinations.\n\nFirst, I should note that 121 is a prime number, which could make division or multiplication tricky. Let's see the numbers: 50, 92, 6, 85. These are all positive integers. Since 121 is not too large, maybe subtraction or addition could work. Let me try different combinations.\n\nLet me look for numbers that can add up close to 121. For example, 85 + 50 = 135, which is 14 over. If I subtract something from that. Let's see: 135 - (92 - 6). Wait, 92 -6 is 86, so 135 -86 = 49. Not helpful. Alternatively, 85 + 50 is 135. Maybe 135 - (92/6). But 92 divided by 6 is about 15.33, so 135 -15.33≈119.67, which is close but not exact. And we have to use all numbers, so division there might not help.\n\nAlternatively, 92 is a big number. If I subtract something from 92 to get close. Let's see: 92 - (some combination). If I do 92 + 85 = 177. That's way over. Maybe 177 - (50 +6) = 177 -56 = 121. Wait, that's exactly 121! Let me check: 92 +85 =177. Then subtract 50 and 6. So 177 -50 is 127, then minus 6 is 121. But I need to use all numbers once. So the equation would be (92 +85) -50 -6. Let's compute that: 177 -50=127; 127-6=121. Yes! That works. All numbers are used once: 92,85,50,6. Operations used are + and two -. \n\nWait, but the problem says \"create an equation\" using all numbers with basic operations. So maybe the equation is 92 + 85 -50 -6 = 121. Let me check that: 92+85 is indeed 177, minus 50 is 127, minus 6 is 121. Yes! That uses all four numbers, each once, and the operations are addition and subtraction. \n\nSo the equation would be 92 + 85 - 50 - 6 = 121. Let me make sure there's no other way. Another possibility: Maybe using multiplication or division. For example, 85 + 50 =135. Then 135 - (92/6). But 92 divided by 6 is approximately 15.333, so 135 -15.333≈119.666, which isn't 121. Not helpful. What if I do 92 - (85/ something). Let's see: 85 divided by 5 is 17, but 5 isn't in the numbers. 85 divided by 6 is about 14.166. 92 -14.166≈77.833. Then adding 50 would be 127.833. Not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, 50 * 6 =300. Then 300 - something. 300 -92=208. 208-85=123. Close but not 121. Alternatively, 300 - (92+85)=300 -177=123 again. Hmm. \n\nAnother angle: 85 - 6 =79. Then 79 +50=129. Then 129 -8=121, but 8 isn't one of the numbers. Alternatively, 85 -50=35. 35 * something. 35*3=105, but 3 isn't here. 35* (6) =210. 210 -92=118. No. \n\nWait, maybe (92 - 50) * something. 92-50=42. 42 *3=126, but 3 isn't available. 42* (6/ something). 42*(6/85) is not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, 85 * 6 =510. 510 - 92 =418. 418 /50≈8.36. Not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, 50 * (92 -85) =50*7=350. 350 -6=344. Not 121. \n\nHmm. It seems that the first approach of 92 +85 -50 -6 is the correct way. Let me verify again:\n\n92 +85 =177\n\n177 -50 =127\n\n127 -6 =121\n\nYes, exactly. So the equation is 92 + 85 -50 -6 =121.

I need to create an equation using the numbers 27, 15, 2, and 7 exactly once each, with any of the basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) to reach 648. Hmm, 648 is a pretty big number, so I probably need multiplication. Let me start by thinking about how to get large numbers.\n\nFirst, 27 is a big number. If I can multiply 27 by something else, that might help. Let's see, 27 multiplied by what? Let's check what 27 times 24 is, but 24 isn't directly here. Wait, 15 and 7 and 2. Maybe combine those first. Let's see, 15 minus 7 is 8, then times 2 would be 16. Then 27 times 16 is 432. Not enough. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 15 plus 7 is 22, times 2 is 44. Then 27 times 44 is 1188, which is way over. But 1188 is more than 648. So maybe subtraction? Let's think differently.\n\nWhat if I use division to get a higher number? Like, if I divide 15 by something. But 15 divided by 2 is 7.5, which might not help. Or 7 divided by 2 is 3.5. Not sure. Maybe multiplication of 15 and 2 first. 15*2=30. Then 30 times 7 is 210. Then 27 times 210 would be 5670, way too big. That's not helpful.\n\nWait, 15*2 is 30. Then 30 plus 7 is 37. 27*37 is 999. Still not 648. Hmm.\n\nWhat if I use subtraction to reduce a larger number? Let's see, 27*15 is 405. Then 405 times something. If I use 7 and 2. Maybe 7-2=5. Then 405*5=2025. Nope. Or 7+2=9. 405*9=3645. Still too big.\n\nAlternatively, 27* (15 + something). Let's see, 15 + (7*2) =15 +14=29. Then 27*29=783. Closer but not 648. Hmm.\n\nWait, 648 divided by 27 is 24. So maybe if I can get 24 from 15, 7, and 2. Let's check: 15 +7 +2=24. But that uses all three, so 27*(15+7+2) =27*24=648. Wait, but does that use all numbers once? Let me check: 27 is used, 15,7,2 each used once. Yes! So the equation would be 27*(15+7+2)=648. But wait, I need to use each number exactly once, and all of them. So 27,15,7,2 are all used once each. That works. Let me calculate: 15+7=22, 22+2=24. 27*24=648. Yes, that's correct. So the equation is 27*(15+7+2)=648. But do I need to combine them in a different way? Because the user might want me to use each operation at least once, but the problem states \"You can use basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) one or multiple times\" so I can use multiple operations. But in this case, it's only addition and multiplication. Is that allowed? The problem says you can use each operation one or multiple times, but there's no requirement to use all operations. So this should be acceptable. Let me verify again: 15+7+2=24, 27*24=648. So the equation is 27*(15+7+2)=648. All numbers used once each, and operations are + and *. So this should work.\n</think>\n\n<answer>27*(15+7+2)=648</answer>"}]}

The operations allowed are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Hmm, the target is 552, which is already one of the numbers. So maybe I can use 552 directly and somehow make the other numbers cancel out or combine to zero or one? Let me think.\n\nSince 552 is the target, perhaps 552 multiplied or divided by something that equals itself. For example, 552 multiplied by 1 would give 552. So can I make 1 using the other numbers 47, 46, and 93? Let's check. What if I do 47 - 46? That equals 1. Then, if I multiply 552 by (47 - 46), that would be 552 * 1 = 552. But then there's still 93 left. Oh wait, I have to use all four numbers. So I need to include 93 as well. Hmm, how can I incorporate 93 into the equation without changing the result?\n\nWait, maybe there's a way to structure it so that 93 is part of the operations that result in 1. Let me try again. Let's see: 47 - 46 = 1. Then 93 divided by 93 is 1, but I can't use 93 twice. Alternatively, maybe 93 minus something? Let's check. 93 minus (47 + 46) is 93 - 93 = 0. That would give 552 * 0, which is 0, not 552. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use division in a way that cancels out the 93. For example, 552 * (something) / 93. If that something is 93, then it would be 552. But I can't use 93 twice. Let's see. If I have 552 * (47 - 46) * (93 / 93), but again, that uses 93 twice. Not allowed.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use subtraction. Let's try 552 + (47 - 46) - 93. That would be 552 +1 -93 = 552 -92 = 460. Not 552. Not helpful.\n\nWhat if I do 552 + (93 - 47 -46)? Let's compute that: 93 -47 is 46, then 46 -46 is 0. So 552 +0=552. But that uses 93,47,46, and 552. Wait, yes! Let's check: 93 -47 -46 = 0, so 552 +0=552. That uses all four numbers. Let me verify:\n\nNumbers used: 552, 93,47,46. Each once. The equation would be 552 + (93 -47 -46) = 552 +0=552. Yes, that works. So the equation is 552 + (93 -47 -46) = 552. But I need to write it in an equation form using all the numbers once. Wait, is that acceptable? Because the original problem says \"create an equation that equals 552\" using all numbers once. So the left side would be 552 + (93 -47 -46), and the right side is 552. But the problem might just require an expression that equals 552, not necessarily an equation with equals sign. Wait, the example given is \"(1 + 2) / 3\", which is just an expression. So maybe the answer is the expression that evaluates to 552. So perhaps 552 + (93 -47 -46) would be 552 +0=552, but then the expression is 552 +93 -47 -46. But does that use all numbers? Let's see: 552, 93,47,46. Yes, each used once. And the operations are addition and subtractions. So 552 +93 -47 -46. Let's compute that: 552 +93 is 645, minus 47 is 598, minus 46 is 552. Exactly. So that's a valid equation. Alternatively, could we have parentheses? Like (552 +93) - (47 +46) = 645 -93 = 552. So another way to write that. So the equation would be (552 +93) - (47 +46) = 552. That uses all numbers once. So either way, but perhaps the second version with parentheses is clearer. Let me check: 552 +93 is 645, 47+46 is 93, so 645 -93 is 552. Yes. So that works. So the equation is (552 +93) - (47 +46) = 552, but as an expression, it would be (552 + 93) - (47 + 46). That would equal 552. Alternatively, 552 +93 -47 -46, which is the same without parentheses due to left associativity. But the parentheses might make it clearer. Either way is acceptable. So that's one possible solution.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(552 + 93) - (47 + 46)</answer>"}]}

The operations allowed are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Hmm, how to approach this?\n\nFirst, maybe I can look at the target number, 80, and see if any of these numbers can be combined in a way that gets close. Let's list the numbers: 63, 51, 68, 24. Let's see, 68 is close to 70, which is a multiple of 10, but 68 is 2 less than 70. 24 is a number that's often used in multiplication or division. 63 and 51 are both in the 50-70 range.\n\nLet me think about possible pairs. For example, 68 plus 24 is 92. That's more than 80. Then, subtract 12? But I don't have a 12. Wait, but maybe using other numbers. Alternatively, 63 minus 51 is 12. So if I do 68 + 24 - (63 -51), that would be 68+24=92, 63-51=12, 92-12=80. Wait, that uses all numbers! Let me check:\n\n68 + 24 - (63 - 51) = 68 +24 is 92. Then 63 -51 is 12. So 92 -12 is 80. That works! But wait, each number is used once. Let's verify: 68, 24, 63, 51. Yes, all four numbers are used once. The operations are addition, subtraction (twice). So that equation would be (68 +24) - (63 -51) = 80. Let me write that as an equation: (68 + 24) - (63 - 51) = 80. But wait, the parentheses are important here. Let me make sure the order is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe another combination. Let's check another way. Let's see if there's another possibility. For example, 63 + 24 = 87. Then 87 minus something. 51 and 68 left. 68 -51 is 17. 87 -17 is 70. Not 80. Alternatively, 63 + 17 = 80. How to get 17? 68 -51=17, then 63 +17=80, but then 24 is left. Hmm. So that's 63 + (68 -51) = 63 +17=80. But then 24 is unused. So that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, 51 -24=27. Then 63 +27=90. 90 minus 10=80. But how to get 10 from remaining numbers? 68 minus 58? No. Not helpful. Alternatively, 68 divided by something. 68 divided by 24 is roughly 2.83, which might not help. 51 divided by something. Maybe 51 divided by 3 is 17, but 3 isn't present. Hmm.\n\nWait, the first idea where I had (68 +24) - (63 -51) seems to work. Let me verify again:\n\n68 +24 = 92\n\n63 -51=12\n\n92 -12=80. Yes, that's correct. All numbers used once. So the equation is (68 +24) - (63 -51) =80. So the way to write it is (68 + 24) - (63 - 51) = 80. Let me check if that's allowed. The operations are two additions and one subtraction? Wait, no: the first part is addition (68+24), then the second part is subtraction (63-51), then subtract that result from the first. So total operations: +, -, -.

All numbers must be used exactly once, and I can only use basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division. Hmm.\n\nFirst, let me list the numbers again: 63, 41, 9, 41. Wait, there are two 41s. But the problem says each number can only be used once. Oh, but since there are two 41s in the given numbers, does that mean we can use each 41 once? So it's allowed because they're separate instances. The problem states \"each number can only be used once\", but if there are duplicates in the input, we can use each instance once. So that's okay.\n\nSo the target is 89. Let me think. Let's try combining the larger numbers first. 63 and 41 are the bigger ones. Let's see 63 + 41 is 104. That's already over 89. Maybe subtract something. 63 + 41 = 104. Then subtract the other 41: 104 - 41 = 63. Not helpful. Then subtract 9: 104 - 9 = 95. Still not 89. Alternatively, 63 - 41 = 22. Then 22 + 41 = 63. Again, not helpful. Maybe 63 * something? 63 * 1 would be 63, but we need to use 9. 63 * (something involving 9). Let's see. Maybe 63 + (41 - 9) = 63 + 32 = 95. Still not 89.\n\nWhat if I subtract the two 41s first? 41 - 41 = 0. Then we have 63 and 9 left. 63 + 9 = 72. 63 - 9 = 54. Not 89. That approach doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, maybe multiply 9 and 41. 9 * 41 is 369. Then see how to combine with 63 and 41. 369 + 63 = 432. Then subtract 41? 432 - 41 = 391. Way too big. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe divide. Let's see. If I take 63 and divide by 9, that's 7. Then 7 * 41 = 287. Then subtract the other 41: 287 - 41 = 246. Not 89.\n\nAlternatively, 41 divided by something. 41 / 9 is about 4.555. Not sure. If I do 63 + (41 / 9) + 41, that's 63 + 4.555... + 41 ≈ 108.555. Not helpful.\n\nHow about combining the two 41s with subtraction? 41 - 41 = 0. Then 63 + 9 = 72. Not 89. Not useful.\n\nWhat if I do 63 + 9 = 72. Then 72 + 41 = 113. Then subtract the other 41: 113 - 41 = 72. Still not 89.\n\nWait, maybe multiply 41 and 9 and then add 63, then subtract the other 41. Let's compute that: (41 * 9) + 63 - 41. 41*9 is 369. 369 +63 = 432. 432 -41= 391. Nope, too big.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (63 - 41) * something. 63 -41=22. 22 * 4=88. Close to 89. But how to get 4? Maybe 9 - (41/41). Because 41 divided by 41 is 1. So 9 -1=8. Then 22 *8=176. Not helpful. Wait, but 22 multiplied by 4. Let's see. 22 * (9 - (41/41)) = 22*(9-1)=22*8=176. Not 89.\n\nHmm. Let's try different combinations. Maybe 41 + 41 = 82. Then 82 + 9 = 91. 91 - 63=28. No. Alternatively, 41 +41=82, then 82 + something. 89-82=7. How to get 7 from 63 and 9. 63 divided by 9 is 7. So 82 + (63/9) = 82 +7=89. Wait, that works! Let me check. 41 +41=82. 63 divided by9=7. 82 +7=89. But we need to use all numbers exactly once. So 41,41,63,9. So in this equation: 41 +41 + (63/9) =89. Yes! That uses both 41s, the 63, and the 9. Each number is used once. The operations are addition and division. So the equation would be (41 +41) + (63 /9)=89. Let's verify: 41+41=82. 63/9=7. 82+7=89. Perfect. That works.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(41 + 41) + (63 / 9) = 89</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using all the numbers 78, 35, 708, and 13 exactly once, with basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) to get 764. Hmm. Let me start by thinking about how these numbers can combine. \n\nFirst, looking at the numbers, 708 is the largest. Maybe that's a good starting point. If I can somehow subtract or add other numbers to 708 to get close to 764. Let's see: 764 - 708 is 56. So maybe if I can get 56 from the remaining numbers 78, 35, and 13. Let's check: 78 minus 13 is 65, which is too big. 35 plus 13 is 48. Not quite. 78 - 35 is 43. Still not 56. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe multiplying. 35 divided by something? 35 times 13 is 455, which is way too big. 78 divided by 13 is 6. Then 35 times 6 would be 210. Adding that to 708 gives 918, which is way over. Not helpful.\n\nWait, another approach: Maybe 708 plus something. 708 + 78 is 786. Then subtract... 786 - 35 = 751, which is still less than 764. Then subtract 13? 751 -13=738. No. Or maybe 708 +35=743. Then need 21 more. 78 and 13 left. 78/13=6. 743 +6=749. Still not enough. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, could I use multiplication somewhere else? Let's think. Maybe 78 multiplied by something. 78 *13=1014. That's a big number. Then subtract 708? 1014-708=306. Then subtract 35? 306-35=271. Not helpful. \n\nWhat if I subtract 78 from 708? 708-78=630. Then add 35: 630+35=665. Then add 13: 665+13=678. Not enough. \n\nAlternatively, 708 divided by something. 708 divided by 35 is about 20.22... Not sure if that's useful. 708 divided by 13 is around 54.46. Maybe subtract that from 78? 78 - 54.46=23.54. Then add 35? 23.54 +35=58.54. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe I need to combine operations. Let's try to get 764 by using 708 as a base. Let's see: 764 is 708 + 56. So I need 56 from 78, 35, 13. Let's see: 78 - (35 -13) = 78 -22=56. Oh! That's possible. Wait, 35-13=22, then 78-22=56. Then add that to 708: 708 +56=764. So putting it all together: 708 + (78 - (35 -13))=764. Let's check the operations. 35-13=22, 78-22=56, 708+56=764. Yes! And all numbers are used once. Let me verify each step again:\n\n35 minus 13 is 22. Then 78 minus 22 is 56. Then 708 plus 56 is 764. Exactly. And all numbers used: 78,35,13,708. Perfect. So the equation would be 708 + (78 - (35 - 13)) = 764. Let me make sure there's no parentheses missing. The operations order is correct. The innermost parentheses first (35-13), then subtract that result from 78, then add to 708. Yes. So that should work.\n</think>\n\n<answer>708 + (78 - (35 - 13)) = 764</answer>"}]}

Hmm, let's start by thinking about combinations.\n\nFirst, maybe try multiplying some numbers to get a larger value. 60 and 2 are there. 60 multiplied by 2 is 120. Wait, that's already 120. But then I have to use all four numbers. So that approach alone won't work because I have 12 and 48 left. Maybe I can combine them in a way that their operations result in 1, so that when I multiply by 60 and 2, it stays 120. Let me see. 12 divided by 48 is 0.25, which isn't helpful. 48 divided by 12 is 4. So 48/12 is 4. Then if I take 60 * 2 * (48/12), that would be 60*2*4=480. That's way too big. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe subtract or add. If I take 60 + 48, that's 108. Then 12 + 2 is 14. 108 +14=122. Not 120. Close though. Maybe 60 +48=108, then 12-2=10, so 108+10=118. Still not. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I need to use division or multiplication with the larger numbers. Let's think. If I do 60 * (48 / (12 - 2)). Let's check: 12-2=10. 48/10=4.8. 60*4.8=288. No. Not right.\n\nAlternatively, (60 - 48) * (12 + 2). That's 12*14=168. No. Not 120. How about 60 - (48 / (12 / 2)). Let's compute inside the parentheses first: 12/2=6. Then 48/6=8. 60-8=52. Not 120. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe using 60 and 48 first. 60 +48=108. Then 12*2=24. 108+24=132. No. 108-24=84. Not 120. Hmm.\n\nWhat if we do 48 - 12 =36. Then 60 +36=96, and 96 * (2) =192. No. Not helpful. Or 60*2=120. Then how to use the remaining 12 and 48? But the problem requires using all numbers once. So 60*2=120, but then we have to include 12 and 48. Maybe 60*2 + (48 -12)=120 +36=156. No. That's over. Alternatively, 60*2 - (48 -12)=120-36=84. No. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps 12 and 48 can be combined in a division. 48/12=4. Then 4*60=240. Then 240/2=120. Oh! Wait, that uses all numbers. Let's check: 48 divided by 12 is 4. Then 4 multiplied by 60 is 240. 240 divided by 2 equals 120. So the equation would be ((48 / 12) * 60) / 2 = 120. Let's verify the order of operations. First, 48 divided by 12 is 4. Then 4 times 60 is 240. Then 240 divided by 2 is 120. Yes, that works. All numbers used once: 48,12,60,2.

I need to create an equation using all the numbers 97, 54, 9, and 30 exactly once, and the result should be 485. The allowed operations are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Hmm, where to start?\n\nFirst, I know that 485 is a relatively large number, so maybe multiplication will be involved. Let me look at the numbers given. The largest number here is 97. If I can multiply 97 by something to get close to 485, that might help. Let's check: 97 multiplied by 5 is 485 exactly. Oh, wait, that's interesting. So if I can somehow get 5 from the remaining numbers 54, 9, and 30, then multiplying 97 by 5 would give me 485. That sounds promising.\n\nSo how can I get 5 using 54, 9, and 30? Let's think. Let's see the numbers: 54, 9, 30. Maybe subtract or divide? Let's try combinations. If I take 54 and subtract 9, that's 45. Then 45 divided by 9 is 5. Wait, but I already used 9 in the subtraction. Oh, but I need to use all numbers once. Wait, the numbers left are 54, 9, 30. So all three must be used. Hmm. Maybe 54 - (30 / something). Let's see. 30 divided by 6 is 5. But how to get 6? 54 divided by 9 is 6. So 54 / 9 = 6, then 30 / 6 = 5. So that would use 54, 9, and 30. Let me write that down: 30 / (54 / 9). Let's compute that. 54 divided by 9 is 6, then 30 divided by 6 is 5. Yes, that works. So 30 divided by (54 divided by 9) equals 5. Then multiply that by 97: 97 * (30 / (54 / 9)).\n\nLet me check the calculation step by step. First, 54 divided by 9 is 6. Then 30 divided by 6 is 5. Then 5 multiplied by 97 is 485. Perfect! So putting it all together, the equation would be 97 * (30 / (54 / 9)). Let me make sure all numbers are used once: 97, 54, 9, 30. Yes, each is used exactly once. And the operations are division inside the parentheses, then division again, then multiplication. That should work.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's another way, just to be sure. Maybe using subtraction. For example, 54 - 9 = 45, but then how to get 5 from 45 and 30? Maybe 30 - (54 - 9) = 30 -45 = -15, which isn't helpful. Alternatively, 54 + 30 = 84, divided by 9 gives 9.333..., which isn't 5. So that doesn't help. Another approach: maybe 30 - 9 = 21, then 54 -21 = 33. Not helpful. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 54 / 9 = 6, then 30 - 6 = 24. Then 97 + 24 = 121, which is way off. No. Or 97 * (54 - (30 + 9)). Let's compute that: 30 +9=39, 54-39=15, 97*15=1455. That's way over. Not helpful.\n\nSo the first idea seems the best. Let me confirm again. 54 divided by 9 is 6. Then 30 divided by 6 is 5. Multiply by 97: 97*5=485. Perfect. So the equation is 97 × (30 ÷ (54 ÷ 9)). Let's write that with parentheses properly: 97 * (30 / (54 / 9)). Yes, that uses all numbers once and gives the correct result.\n</think>\n\n<answer>97 * (30 / (54 / 9))</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using all the numbers 61, 32, 24, and 32 exactly once, and the result should be 37. Hmm. Let's start by thinking about possible operations.\n\nFirst, 37 is a prime number, so maybe subtraction or addition could get me there. Let's look at the numbers I have. There's 61, which is the largest, and two 32s. Maybe I can subtract something from 61 to get 37. Let's try that. 61 minus what equals 37? That's 61 - 24 = 37. Oh, wait, so if I can use 61 minus 24, that gives me 37. Then I have the two 32s left. But I need to use all numbers. So how can I incorporate the 32s into that equation? Maybe I can manipulate the 32s to somehow cancel out or combine with the other numbers.\n\nWait, the two 32s. Since they are the same number, maybe division? Like 32 divided by 32 is 1. Then if I have 61 - 24 - (32/32), would that work? Let's calculate that. 61 -24 is 37, then 37 -1 is 36. That's not 37. Hmm. So that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe add them? 32 +32 is 64. Then 64... but how to get 37 from that. Maybe 64 - something. 64 - (61 -24) = 64 -37=27. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of combining the numbers in a different way. Let's see, if I use the two 32s in some operation. Maybe 32 -32 =0. Then 61 -24 +0=37. But then I have to use all numbers, so maybe (61 -24) + (32 -32) =37. But that uses all numbers. Wait, does that work? Let's check. 61-24 is 37. 32-32 is 0. So 37 +0=37. Yes. But wait, the problem states that each number can be used only once, and I have two 32s. So using both 32s in (32 -32) is allowed because each is used once. The problem says each number can be used once, but since there are two 32s, they are separate numbers. Wait, but actually, if the original list has two 32s, then each can be used once. So this equation would be: 61 -24 +32 -32 =37. Let's check: 61-24=37, then 37+32=69, 69-32=37. Yes. That works. But does this count as using all numbers? Each number is used once: 61, 24, 32, 32. So yes. So the equation would be 61 -24 +32 -32 =37. But maybe we need to group them with parentheses for clarity. Like (61 -24) + (32 -32) =37. But parentheses aren't necessary here because addition and subtraction are left associative. But perhaps the problem expects an equation that combines all numbers with operations, maybe using multiplication or division as well. Let me check if that's necessary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe another approach. Let's see, 32 divided by something. For example, 61 - (32 / (32 -24)). Let's calculate denominator:32-24=8. Then 32/8=4. So 61-4=57. Not 37. Not helpful. Alternatively, (61 -32) + (32 -24). Let's compute that: 29 +8=37. Oh! Wait, that's 61-32=29, 32-24=8, 29+8=37. So the equation would be (61 -32) + (32 -24) =37. But here, the numbers used are 61,32,32,24. Each exactly once. Yes. Because we have two 32s. So that works. Let me verify again. 61-32 is 29. Then the second 32 minus 24 is 8. 29+8=37. Yes. That seems correct. So the equation is (61 - 32) + (32 - 24) = 37. That uses all four numbers once each. And the operations are subtraction and addition. That should be acceptable. So this seems like a valid solution.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(61 - 32) + (32 - 24) = 37</answer>"}]}

Let's start by thinking about the target number, 213. It's a bit over 200, so maybe combining the larger numbers first would help. The largest number here is 71. If I can somehow get 71 close to 200 and then add or subtract the remaining numbers. Let me try that.\n\nIf I take 71 and multiply it by something. 71*3 is 213, but do I have a 3? Well, I have 36, 60, 48. Maybe I can use those to get a 3. Let's see. 60 divided by something. 60 divided by 20 is 3, but I don't have a 20. Alternatively, 36 divided by 12 is 3. But how do I get 12 from the other numbers? 48 divided by 4 is 12. Wait, 48 divided by (something). Maybe 48 divided by (60 minus 36)? Let's check that: 60 minus 36 is 24. Then 48 divided by 24 is 2. That gives me 2, but I need 3. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 36 minus 48 divided by something. Wait, 48 divided by 16 is 3. How to get 16? 60 minus 44 is 16, but I don't have 44. Maybe 71 minus 55 is 16... No, that's not helpful. This might not be the right approach.\n\nLet me think differently. What if I subtract some numbers to get close. 71 is a big number. If I subtract 60 from 71, that's 11. Then I have 36 and 48 left. 36 plus 48 is 84. 11 plus 84 is 95. Not close. Maybe I need to multiply some numbers.\n\nWhat if I do 71 plus 36? That's 107. Then 60 plus 48 is 108. 107 plus 108 is 215. Oh, that's 215, which is 2 more than 213. Hmm. So maybe if I can subtract 2 from that. But how? Wait, 215 minus 2 is 213. But how do I get 2 using the numbers? Wait, I already used all numbers in that case. Because 71+36+60+48 is 215. But we can't use them all in addition. So maybe need to rearrange operations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use multiplication. Let's see. 71 * 3 would be 213. So how can I get 3 from 36, 60, 48. Let me try again. 60 divided by (something) is 3. 60 divided by 20 is 3, but how to get 20. 48 minus 28 is 20. But 28 from 36 minus 8, but 8 from where? Maybe 60 minus 36 is 24. Then 48 divided by 24 is 2. Then 2 plus 1 is 3. Wait, but where would the 1 come from? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, 36 divided by 12 is 3. How to get 12. 60 minus 48 is 12. Oh! Wait, that might work. So 36 divided by (60 - 48) is 36/12 = 3. Then 71 * 3 is 213. Let me check: 60 - 48 is 12, then 36 divided by 12 is 3. Then 71 multiplied by that 3 gives 213. But wait, that uses all the numbers? Let me list the numbers used: 71, 36, 60, 48. Yes, each is used once. So that would be 71 * (36 / (60 - 48)) = 71 * (36 / 12) = 71 * 3 = 213. Yes! That seems to work. Let me write that out properly. The equation would be 71 * (36 / (60 - 48)) = 213. Let me check the calculation step by step: 60 - 48 = 12, 36 / 12 = 3, 71 * 3 = 213. Correct. All numbers used once. That should be the solution.\n</think>\n\n<answer>71 * (36 / (60 - 48)) = 213</answer>"}]}

Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, I'll recall that 123 is the target. Let me think about the numbers given. The numbers are 56, 7, 28, and 65. Let's look for combinations that could get close. Maybe combining the larger numbers first. 65 and 56 are the two largest. If I add them, 65 + 56 = 121. That's pretty close to 123. Then I need to make up the remaining 2 using 7 and 28. How can I get 2 from 28 and 7? Let's see. 28 divided by 7 is 4. Then 4 minus 2... Wait, but we need to use both 28 and 7. Alternatively, 28 - 7 is 21. Hmm, but 21 is too big. Wait, maybe subtract 28/7 from somewhere. If I have 121 from 65 + 56, then adding 28/7 would be 121 + 4 = 125, which is over. Alternatively, maybe subtract 28/7 from that sum: 121 - 4 = 117. That's not 123. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe multiply 65 by something. 65 * 2 would be 130, which is 7 over. But how to get 2? Using 28 and 7. 28 divided by 7 is 4. 4 minus 2 is 2, but again, not sure. Wait, maybe 65 * (something) + something else. Let's try different combinations.\n\nWhat if I use 56 and 7. 56 divided by 7 is 8. Then 8 multiplied by 28 is 224. That's way too big. Then maybe subtract 65: 224 - 65 = 159. No, not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe 65 + 28 = 93. Then 56 - 7 = 49. 93 + 49 = 142. No. Not close.\n\nAlternatively, 65 - 28 = 37. Then 56 + 7 = 63. 37 + 63 = 100. Still not 123.\n\nHmm. Let's try another approach. Let's think of 123 as 120 + 3. How to get 120? 56 + 64, but 64 isn't directly here. Or 65 + 55. 55 could be 56 -1, but 1 is not easy. Alternatively, 28 * 4 is 112, then plus 8 is 120. But how?\n\nWait, maybe 7 * 17.58 is about 123, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, think of combining operations. Let's see.\n\nWhat if I do 65 + 56 = 121, as before. Then need 2 more. But we have to use 28 and 7. So maybe 28 divided by 7 is 4, and then 121 + (4) = 125. No. But wait, maybe subtract that 4 from somewhere else. Wait, if the total is 121, but I need to use both 28 and 7, perhaps the equation is (65 + 56) + (28 / 7) - something? Wait, but that would require using all numbers once. Wait, 65 + 56 + (28 /7) = 121 +4=125. But then 7 is already used in the division. Hmm, but each number can be used only once. Wait, in that case, 28 divided by 7 uses both 28 and 7, so that's allowed. Then 65 +56 + (28/7) = 121 +4=125. But 125 is 2 over. Hmm. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 65 * 2 is 130, then subtract 7. But how to get 2 from 56 and 28. 56 divided by 28 is 2. So 65 * (56/28) -7. Let's compute that: 56/28=2, 65*2=130, 130-7=123. Oh! Wait, that uses all numbers. Let's check:\n\n65 * (56 / 28) -7 = ?\n\n56 divided by 28 is 2. So 65 *2 =130. 130 -7=123. Yes! And all numbers are used once: 65, 56, 28, and 7. That works. So the equation would be 65 * (56 / 28) -7 =123.\n\nLet me verify again: 56 divided by 28 is 2. Multiply by 65: 65*2=130. Subtract 7:130-7=123. Exactly. So that's the equation.\n</think>\n\n<answer>65 * (56 / 28) - 7 = 123</answer>"}]}

What if I subtract? Let's see. 75 - 53 is 22. Then adding 61 would be 83, plus 19 is 102. Wait, let me check that again. 75 - 53 = 22. Then 22 + 61 = 83. Then 83 + 19 = 102. Oh, that uses all numbers. Wait, but the order of operations? If I do (75 - 53) + 61 + 19, does that equal 102? Let's calculate: 75-53=22, 22+61=83, 83+19=102. Yes! But wait, do I need to use all four numbers in the equation? Yes. So that would be 75 - 53 + 61 + 19 = 102. But that adds all four numbers, using subtraction once and addition three times. But each number is used once. Let me check again: 75, 53, 61, 19. All are used once. So the equation would be (75 - 53) + 61 + 19 = 102. But maybe I can write it without the parentheses because subtraction and addition are left associative. Alternatively, maybe another arrangement. Let me see if there's another way. Maybe multiplication or division could help. For example, 19 and 61 are primes. 61 divided by something? Let's see. 75 - (61 / 19) +53. Let's calculate 61 divided by 19 is approximately 3.21. Then 75 -3.21 is 71.79 plus 53 is 124.79, which is not 102. Not helpful. What if I multiply 19 and 5 (but 5 isn't a number here). Wait, maybe 75 - 53 =22. Then 19 times something? 22 times 19 is 418. 418 plus 61 is 479, which is way over. Not helpful. Alternatively, 75 divided by something. 75 / (61 - 53) = 75/8=9.375. Then 9.375 *19=178.125, which is over. Hmm. Alternatively, 61 -19=42. Then 42 + 53=95, plus 7 (but 7 isn't here). Wait, maybe 61 - (75 / (53 - 19))? Let's see: 53-19=34. 75 divided by 34 is about 2.205. Then 61 -2.205=58.795, which is not 102. Not useful. Another approach: Maybe 53 + 19 =72. Then 75 +61=136. 136 -72=64. Not 102. Hmm. Wait, earlier idea where 75-53=22, then add 61 and 19. That works. So the equation would be 75 -53 +61 +19 =102. Let me check again: 75 minus 53 is 22, 22 plus 61 is 83, plus 19 is 102. Yes. That uses all four numbers exactly once with subtraction and additions. So that's the equation. But maybe there's another way with different operations. Let me check another possibility. For example, 61 + 19 =80. Then 75 +53=128. 128 -80=48. No. Or 75 +19=94. 53+61=114. 114-94=20. Not helpful. Alternatively, 75* (61 -53) /19. Let's see: 61-53=8. 75*8=600. 600/19≈31.58. Not 102. What if 75 - (61 - (53 -19))? Let's compute inside out: 53-19=34. 61-34=27. 75-27=48. Not 102. Alternatively, (75 +61) - (53 -19)= 136 -34=102. Oh! Wait, that's a better way. Because 75 +61 is 136, then subtract (53 -19). 53-19=34, so 136-34=102. So the equation would be (75 +61) - (53 -19) =102. That uses all numbers: 75,61,53,19. Each once. And the operations are addition and subtraction. Let me verify: 75+61=136. 53-19=34. 136-34=102. Yes. That works. So this might be a better equation because it uses parentheses to group the operations. So maybe that's the answer. Alternatively, the first way I thought of was 75 -53 +61 +19 =102. But the second way groups the numbers more neatly. Which one is preferable? The problem allows any basic operations, but the example uses parentheses. So maybe using parentheses is acceptable. Let me check both possibilities. The second equation: (75 + 61) - (53 - 19) =102. This uses each number once and all four numbers. Yes. So this seems like a valid answer. Therefore, the equation is (75 + 61) - (53 - 19) = 102.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(75 + 61) - (53 - 19) = 102</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using the numbers 19, 65, 46, and 65, each exactly once, with basic arithmetic operations to get 874. Hmm, 874 is a pretty big number. Let me think about how to get there.\n\nFirst, maybe I should consider multiplication because that can get numbers large quickly. Let's see, the largest numbers here are the two 65s. If I multiply them, 65 * 65 is 4225, which is way bigger than 874. That's too much. Maybe combining them with another operation?\n\nWait, what if I subtract something from that product? 65*65 is 4225, and 4225 - something equals 874. Let's check: 4225 - 874 = 3351. Do I have numbers left that can make 3351? The remaining numbers are 19 and 46. 19 * 46 is 874. Oh! Wait, but 19*46 is 874. But that would mean 65*65 - 19*46 = 4225 - 874 = 3351, which is not helpful. Hmm, maybe that approach isn't right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use division to reduce the numbers. Let's see. If I take 65 and 46, 65*46 is 2990. If I subtract something from that, like 2990 - (the other 65 and 19). Let's see, 65 +19=84. 2990 -84=2906. Still too big. Maybe multiply instead? 65*(46 -19) =65*27=1755. Not enough.\n\nWait, another idea. Let's see if 874 can be broken down. 874 divided by 19 is 46. Because 19*46=874. Oh! So if I can get 19*46, but wait, the problem is I have two 65s to use. So maybe if I can somehow get 19*46 and then use the 65s in a way that doesn't interfere. But how?\n\nWait, but 19*46 is exactly 874. But then I need to use both 65s. So maybe I can add or subtract zero? Because 65-65=0. So 19*46 + (65-65) = 874 +0=874. That works! Because each number is used once: 19, 46, 65, 65. The equation would be (19 * 46) + (65 - 65) = 874. But is that allowed? Using subtraction to create zero. Let me check the rules again.\n\nThe problem says each number can be used once, and all must be used. Operations can be used multiple times. So yes, using 65-65 as part of the equation is allowed. So that equation would work. Let me verify:\n\n19 * 46 = 874. Then 65 -65=0. Adding them gives 874 +0=874. Perfect. So the equation is (19 × 46) + (65 - 65) = 874. But wait, the parentheses are important here. Alternatively, it could be written as 19*46 +65 -65. Since addition and subtraction are left to right, but in this case, the order doesn't matter. So that's a valid equation.\n\nBut let me make sure there's no other way. Maybe another combination. Let's think again. For example, using division. Suppose 65 divided by something. But 65/19 is about 3.42, which isn't helpful. 65/46 is about 1.41. Hmm. Alternatively, multiplying the two 65s: 65*65=4225. Then subtract 19*46=874. So 4225 -874=3351. Not helpful. Wait, but 4225 divided by something. 4225 /5=845, which is close to 874, but not quite. Maybe not.\n\nAnother idea: 65*(something). If I take 65 and multiply by 19, that's 1235. Then subtract 65*46? 65*46=2990. 1235-2990= -1755. Not helpful. Alternatively, 65*(19 -46)=65*(-27)= -1755. No.\n\nWait, what if I use 46 and 65. 46*19=874, as before. Then the two 65s can be used as 65-65=0. So yeah, that seems like the only way. Because if I try to use the two 65s in another way, like adding them (65+65=130), and then multiply by something. 130* something. Let's see 130*7=910, which is over 874. 130*6.7=871, close but not exact. But we need integers here, and using the numbers once. So maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, 65* (46 - (19 +65)). Let's compute: 46 -19 -65=46-84= -38. 65*(-38)= -2470. Not helpful.\n\nHmm. So the only way seems to be using 19*46 to get 874, then using 65-65 to add zero. So the equation is (19 × 46) + (65 - 65) = 874. That's the simplest way. Let me double-check that all numbers are used once: 19, 46, 65, 65. Yes, each is used once. Operations are + and -, which are allowed. So this should be correct.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(19 * 46) + (65 - 65) = 874</answer>"}]}

The target is 246. Let's think about possible operations. Since 246 is a fairly large number, maybe multiplication is involved here. Let me check if any of these numbers multiplied by another could get close.\n\nLooking at 120 and 22. If I multiply 120 by 2, that's 240, which is close to 246. But how can I get a 2 from the remaining numbers? The remaining numbers are 77 and 71. If I subtract 71 from 77, that gives 6. Hmm, 6 divided by 3 is 2, but I don't have a 3. Wait, maybe I can use 77 - 71 = 6. Then if I divide that by another number... But I have to use all numbers. Let me think again.\n\nWait, maybe 77 - 71 is 6, and then 6 plus 22 is 28. Then 28 times something? But 120 is left. 28 * 120 is way too big. That's 3360. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 120 - 22 = 98. Then 98 plus 77 is 175, plus 71 is 246. Wait, that would be 120 -22 = 98, then 98 +77 = 175, then 175 +71 = 246. But that uses all numbers: 120-22+77+71. Let me check that: 120-22=98, 98+77=175, 175+71=246. Yes! That works. Wait, but does that use each number exactly once? Yes: 120, 22, 77, 71, all used once. The operations are subtraction and addition. So that would be (120 - 22) + 77 + 71 = 246. Let me compute that again: 120-22=98; 98+77=175; 175+71=246. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but the problem says you can use the operations one or multiple times. So that equation would be valid. Let me make sure there's no restriction on the order or grouping. The equation would be 120 - 22 + 77 + 71 = 246. But to make it clear with parentheses, maybe (120 - 22) + 77 + 71. But parentheses might not be necessary since subtraction and addition are left associative. But as per the example, they put parentheses even if not needed, but maybe just to group terms. Alternatively, maybe another way.\n\nAlternatively, let me check another possibility. Let's think multiplication. 77 * 3 is 231. 231 + 15 = 246. Hmm, but how to get 15. 22 - (120/71). But that's getting fractions, which might complicate. Alternatively, 71 + 22 = 93. 120 - 93 = 27. 27 * 77. No, that's way bigger.\n\nAnother approach: 120 + 71 = 191. 77 +22 =99. 191 +99=290. Too much. 191 -99=92. Not helpful. 191*99 is way over.\n\nWait, maybe subtract some numbers. 120 - 77 =43. Then 43 +71=114. 114 +22=136. Not enough. Alternatively, 120 -71=49. 49 +77=126. 126 +22=148. No.\n\nAlternatively, 77 *22= 1694. That's way too big. 1694 minus something? 71 +120=191. 1694 -191=1503. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe division. 120 divided by 22 is approximately 5.45. Then 5.45 *71= around 387. Then 387 -77=310. Not close. Alternatively, 71 divided by 22 is about 3.227. Multiply by 77: ~248.5. Close to 246. Hmm, maybe 71/22 *77. Let's compute exactly: (71*77)/22. 71*77 = 5467. 5467 divided by 22 is approximately 248.5. Then subtract 120/ something? Wait, but I have to use all numbers. So maybe that's not the way.\n\nAlternatively, 77 +71 =148. 120 -22=98. 148 +98=246. Oh! Wait, that's exactly the same as before. So 77 +71 + (120 -22) = 246. So that's the same equation as before, just grouped differently. So the equation is 77 +71 +120 -22 =246. Let me verify: 77+71=148; 120-22=98; 148+98=246. Yes, correct. So that uses all numbers once, with addition and subtraction.\n\nTherefore, the equation is 77 +71 +120 -22 =246. So in terms of the required format, since all operations are left to right, but parentheses can be added for clarity. But according to the problem statement, as long as the equation uses each number once and all numbers. So the answer is 77 +71 +120 -22. Or perhaps written with parentheses: (77 +71) + (120 -22). Either way, the result is correct.\n</think>\n\n<answer>77 + 71 + 120 - 22 = 246</answer>"}]}

Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the target number: 883. It's relatively close to 835, which is one of the numbers we have. Maybe I can start by seeing how to adjust 835 to reach 883. The difference between them is 883 - 835 = 48. So if I can somehow create 48 using the remaining numbers (2, 30, 36), that might work. Then, adding that to 835 would give me 883. But wait, 835 + 48 is indeed 883. So how can I get 48 from 2, 30, and 36?\n\nLet's see. 36 and 30 are both larger than 48. Maybe subtracting? 36 - 30 = 6, but then 6 * 2 = 12. Not enough. Alternatively, 30 - 36 = -6, but that's negative. Hmm. What if I add 36 and 30? 36 + 30 = 66. Then 66 - 2 = 64. Still not 48. Alternatively, 36 * 2 = 72. Then 72 - 30 = 42. Still not 48. Maybe 30 * 2 = 60, then 60 - 36 = 24. No. How else?\n\nWait, 36 + (30 - 2) = 36 + 28 = 64. Still not. Alternatively, 30 + (36 / 2) = 30 + 18 = 48! Oh, that's it. So 36 divided by 2 is 18, then 30 + 18 = 48. Then 835 + 48 = 883. Let me check that: 36 / 2 = 18, 30 + 18 = 48, 835 + 48 = 883. Yes! That uses all the numbers: 835, 30, 36, and 2. Let me make sure each is used once. 835 is added, 30 is added, 36 is divided by 2, and 2 is the divisor. So all numbers are used once. So the equation would be 835 + 30 + (36 / 2) = 883. Let me compute that: 36 divided by 2 is 18, 30 + 18 is 48, 835 + 48 is 883. Perfect!\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way, but this seems to work. Let me check if there's a different combination just to be sure. Suppose I try multiplying some numbers. For example, 30 * 36 = 1080. Then 1080 - 835 = 245. Then 245 + 2 = 247. Not close. Alternatively, 835 - 36 = 799, then 30 * 2 = 60, 799 + 60 = 859. Still not. How about 835 * 2 = 1670. Then 1670 - 30 = 1640, then 1640 - 36 = 1604. Way too big. Division? 835 / 30 is about 27.83, which isn't helpful. Maybe 835 - (36 * 2) = 835 -72=763. Then 763 +30=793. Still not. \n\nAnother approach: maybe 30 * 2 = 60. Then 835 +60=895. Then 895 -36=859. Not 883. Hmm. Alternatively, 835 + 36=871. Then 871 + (30-2)=871 +28=899. No. Wait, 871 + 12=883. How to get 12 from 30 and 2? 30 / 2 =15. Then 15 - 3? Wait, but we don't have a 3. Maybe 30 - (2* something). Not sure. Alternatively, 30 - (36/ something). But 36 is already used. So maybe the initial idea is the best. \n\nSo the correct equation would be 835 + 30 + (36 / 2) = 883. Let me write that with parentheses as needed: 835 + 30 + (36 ÷ 2). That's the equation.\n</think>\n\n<answer>835 + 30 + (36 / 2)</answer>"}]}

Let's start by thinking about what operations can combine these numbers.\n\nFirst, 147 is a bit of an odd number. Let me check if it's divisible by any of these numbers. 147 divided by 4 is 36.75, which doesn't seem helpful. Divided by 6 is 24.5, also not an integer. 36? 147/36 is about 4.08. 98? 147/98 is 1.5. Not sure yet.\n\nMaybe I can break down 147 into parts. 147 is 140 + 7, but how to get that from the numbers? Alternatively, 98 is a big number. If I subtract something from 98, maybe. Let's see: 98 + something? 98 + 36 = 134. That's 134, which is less than 147. 98 + 36 + 6 +4 = 144. Close, but missing 3. Not quite.\n\nAlternatively, multiplication. Let's see. 36 times something. 36 *4 = 144. Then 144 + (98 -6)/something? Wait, 144 + 3 =147. But how to get 3 from 98 and 6. 98 divided by something? 98 divided by 6 is about 16.333. Hmm. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe 36 * 4 = 144. Then 144 + (something) = 147. The difference is 3. So to get 3 from 98 and 6. Let's see: 98 - 6* something? 98 - 6*16 = 2, but that's not 3. Alternatively, 6 divided by something. 6/(98/ something). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 98 - (6*4) =98-24=74. Then 74 +36=110, which is not helpful. Hmm.\n\nAnother approach: 36 * (something) + ... Let's see. 36*4=144, which is close. So 144 + 3=147. How to get 3 from 98 and 6. Maybe 6 divided by (98 - something). Wait, 98 - something =2, then 6/2=3. But 98 minus what? 98-96=2. But 96 isn't among the numbers. Wait, but 36 is a number here. Maybe 98 - (36* something). Wait, 36*2=72. 98-72=26. Not helpful. Alternatively, 98/6 is approximately 16.333. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe subtract 98 and use the other numbers. Let me think: 36*6=216. 216 - 4=212. That's way over. 216 - 98=118. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 6*4=24. 24 +36=60. 60 +98=158. Too much. 158- something? But I've already used all numbers.\n\nWait, maybe combine numbers in a division. For example, 98 divided by something. 98/4=24.5, 98/6≈16.333. Maybe 98 divided by (something) gives a number that can be used with others. Like 98/(something) + ... Let's see. If I do 36*4=144, then need 3 more. 3 could come from 6 divided by 2. But where do I get 2? Maybe 98-96=2, but again, 96 isn't here. Alternatively, 6/(4) =1.5. Then 1.5*2=3. But I don't have a 2. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps use fractions. Let me think. 36 divided by 4 is 9. Then 9* something. 9*16.333=147. But 16.333 is 98/6. Wait, 36/4=9, then 9*(98/6). Let's calculate that: 9*(98/6) = 9*(49/3) = (9*49)/3 = (441)/3=147. Oh! That works. Let's check if all numbers are used once: 36, 4 (from 36/4), 98, and 6 (from 98/6). Yes. So the equation would be (36 / 4) * (98 / 6) = 147. Let me verify:\n\n36 divided by 4 is 9. 98 divided by 6 is approximately 16.3333. 9 times 16.3333 is 147. Exactly.

Hmm, 38 is exactly half of 76, which is close to 79. Maybe there's a way to combine these.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about factors of 316. 316 divided by 2 is 158. But 158 is still not directly obvious. Let's see, 79 is a prime number, so maybe it's multiplied by something. 79 times 4 is 316, but we don't have a 4. Wait, but 2 is there. If I can make 4 from 19 and 38, but that might be tricky.\n\nWait, 38 divided by 19 is 2. So 38 /19 = 2. But we already have a 2 in the numbers. Hmm, but if we use that, maybe we can combine things. Let's see.\n\nIf I do 38 divided by 19, that's 2, but then we have to use the original 2 as well. So maybe 79 * (38 /19 + 2) ? Let's calculate that: 38/19 is 2, plus 2 is 4. Then 79 *4 is 316. Oh!

Each number must be used exactly once, and I can use basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division. The goal is to reach 989. Hmm, 989 is a pretty big number. Let's start by looking at the numbers I have. The largest number here is 940. Maybe that's a good starting point. If I can add or subtract the other numbers to 940 to get close to 989.\n\nLet's calculate the difference between 989 and 940. 989 minus 940 is 49. So I need to make 49 using the remaining numbers: 85, 94, and 40. Wait, but I have to use all four numbers. Wait, no, all four numbers must be used. Oh right, so 940, 40, 85, 94 all have to be part of the equation. So maybe 940 plus something, but I need to use 40, 85, 94 as well.\n\nAlternatively, maybe multiply some numbers. Let's think. 85 multiplied by something. 85*11 is 935, which is close to 940. But not sure. Alternatively, 940 divided by something. Hmm. Let's see. Let's try different combinations.\n\nAnother approach: 94 is a number close to 100. Maybe 94*10 is 940, but that's already a number in the list. Maybe combining 85 and 40. 85 +40 is 125. Then 125 + 940 is 1065. Then subtract 94: 1065 -94= 971. Not 989. Hmm. Not quite.\n\nWait, 940 + 85 = 1025. Then subtract 40: 1025-40=985. Then add 4? But 94 is left. Wait, maybe 985 + (94 - something). But how. Alternatively, 940 + 94 = 1034. Then subtract 85: 1034 -85=949. Then subtract 40: 949-40=909. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, multiply. Let's see. If we do 85 * 94. Let's calculate that. 85*94: 85*90=7650, 85*4=340, total 7990. That's way too big. 7990 plus 40 would be 8030, way over. Hmm. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe 940 divided by something. 940 / 40 = 23.5. Then 23.5 * 85=2007.5, which is over. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 85 - 40 =45. Then 940 +45=985. Then add 94- something. Wait, 985 +4=989. But how to get 4 from 94. Maybe 94 divided by something. 94 divided by 23.5 is 4. But 23.5 is from 940/40. Wait, but that might involve using numbers multiple times. Let's see:\n\nWait, if I do 940 /40 =23.5. Then 94 /23.5=4. So 940 + (85 -40) + (94/(940/40)) = 940 +45 +4= 989. But here, the division uses 940 and 40 again, which are already used once. So that's not allowed because each number can only be used once. So that's invalid.\n\nHmm. Another approach: Maybe 94 * 10 =940, but 10 is not a number here. Alternatively, 40 +85=125. Then 125 * something. 125*7=875. Then 875 +94=969. Not enough. 125*8=1000. 1000 -11=989. How to get 11. But I don't have 11. Hmm.\n\nWait, 94 - 85=9. Then 9 + something=989. But how. Let's think. If 940 + (94 -85) +40. 940 +9 +40= 989. Wait, wait, that's 940 +9 +40=989? Let's check: 940 +40 is 980, plus 9 is 989. Yes! So that would be 940 + 40 + (94 -85) =989. But let's check if we use all numbers: 940, 40, 94,85. Yes. Each is used once. The operations are addition and subtraction. So the equation would be 940 + 40 + (94 - 85) = 989. Let's compute:\n\n94 -85 =9\n\n940 +40 =980\n\n980 +9 =989. Correct.\n\nSo that works. All numbers are used once, operations are + and -. So the equation is 940 + 40 + 94 -85 =989. Or written with parentheses for clarity: (940 + 40) + (94 - 85) =989. But parentheses aren't necessary here because addition and subtraction are left associative, but adding them for clarity is okay.\n\nAlternatively, writing it as 940 +40 + (94 -85) =989.\n\nYes, that seems to be the solution.\n</think>\n\n<answer>940 + 40 + 94 - 85 = 989</answer>"}]}

The largest number here is 73, so maybe I can start by seeing how close 73 can get me to 265. If I multiply 73 by something, maybe. Let's check 73*3=219, which is still less than 265. Hmm. 73*4=292, which is over. So maybe combining with other operations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe adding 73 to another number. Let's see: 73 + 72 = 145. Then 145 + 32 = 177, then +12=189. Not enough. So adding all together: 73+72+32+12=189. That's way less. So addition alone isn't enough.\n\nSubtraction might be needed. Let me see. Suppose I do 73* something. Let's see, if I take 73*3=219. Then 265-219=46. So I need to get 46 from the remaining numbers: 32, 12, 72. Wait, but I have to use all numbers. So if I use 73*3, I need to use 72,32,12 to get the remaining 46. Hmm, but how?\n\nWait, but in this case, if I do 73*3, then I have used 73 and maybe 3, but 3 isn't one of the numbers. So perhaps that's not the right approach. Alternatively, maybe combining multiplication and addition.\n\nLet's think differently. Let's see if 73 can be multiplied by one of the other numbers. 73*32 would be way too big. 73*12=876. That's way over. So maybe division. If I divide 73 by something, but 73 is a prime number, so dividing by another number might not help. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe subtract something from 73* something. For example, 73*4=292. If I subtract 292 - something =265. Then 292-265=27. So need to get 27 from 12,32,72. Hmm. How? 12 + something? 32-12=20, not 27. 72/ something. 72 divided by (32-12) = 72/20=3.6. Not helpful. Maybe 32 - (72/12)=32-6=26. Close but not 27. 72/12=6. Then 32-6=26. Hmm. Still not 27.\n\nAlternatively, 12 +32=44. Then 72-44=28. Close to 27, but still not. Maybe that's not the right path.\n\nLet me try another approach. Let's see, 72 and 32. 72 -32=40. Then 40* something. 40*6.625=265. But 6.625 is not easy to get. Wait, perhaps 73 -12=61. Then 72* something. Hmm.\n\nWait, 73*3 is 219. If I add 72 to that, 219+72=291. Then subtract 291 -26=265. How to get 26 from 32 and 12? 32-6=26. But 6 would be from 12/2. But I don't have a 2. Alternatively, 12*(32- something). Maybe 32 - (12/ something). Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 72*32=2304. That's way too big. 72*12=864. Still too big. 73*32=2336, way over. So maybe division is necessary.\n\nWait, let's think of combining numbers. For example, 72 and 12. 72/12=6. Then 6* something. 6*32=192. Then 192 +73=265. Wait, that's 72/12=6, then 6*32=192, plus 73=265. Let me check: (72/12)=6; 6*32=192; 192+73=265. Yes!

The remaining numbers would be 86 and 9. Let's see: 86 -9=77. Yes! So here's the breakdown:\n\nFirst, 95 +90 =185. Then multiply by (86 / 9 - something). Wait, no. Wait, if I use 86 -9 to get 77, then I need to add that to 185*4. But how to get the 4? Because I need to use all numbers. Wait, the numbers are 95,90,86,9. So if I do 95+90=185, then 86-9=77, then 185*4 +77=817. But where does the 4 come from? Because 4 isn't one of our numbers. So that approach might not work since we have to use all the original numbers only once.\n\nWait, maybe another approach. Let's consider 86 and 95. If I subtract them: 95-86=9. But then I have 9 left, which is already a number. So maybe that's redundant. Alternatively, 95*9=855. Then 855 + something. The remaining numbers are 90 and 86. 90+86=176. 855+176=1031. Too big. Alternatively, 855 - (90 -86)=855-4=851. Not 817. \n\nWhat if we do 95* (90 - something). Let's see 90 - 9=81. 95*81=7695. That's way too big. Or 90 -86=4. 95*4=380. Then add 9? 380+9=389. Not helpful.\n\nHmm. Maybe division. Let's see. 90 divided by 9 is 10. Then 86*10=860. Then 860 -95=765. No. Or 860 +95=955. Not 817. \n\nAlternatively, 95*9=855. Then 86 + (90 / something). 90 divided by 9 is 10. So 86 +10=96. 855 +96=951. No. \n\nWait, 95*9=855. Then 855 - (90 -86)=855 -4=851. Still no. \n\nWhat if we use subtraction and multiplication. Maybe (95 -9) * something. 95-9=86. Then 86* (90 -86)=86*4=344. Not enough. \n\nAlternatively, 95*86=8170. That's way too big. Divided by 10. 8170/10=817. But where do we get 10? 90/9=10. So 95*86 divided by (90/9). Let's check:\n\n95*86 = 8170. 90 divided by 9 is 10. Then 8170 /10=817. Yes! So that would be (95 * 86) / (90 /9). Let's verify:\n\nFirst, 90 divided by 9 is 10. Then 95 multiplied by 86 is 8170. Then 8170 divided by 10 equals 817. Perfect! And all numbers are used once: 95,86,90,9. The operations are multiplication, division, and division again. So the equation is (95 * 86) / (90 / 9) =817. Let me check the order of operations. Parentheses first: 90/9=10, then 95*86=8170, then 8170 divided by 10 is indeed 817. Yes, that works.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(95 * 86) / (90 / 9)</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using the numbers 9, 79, 73, and 69 exactly once each, and combine them with basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) to get 773. Hmm, 773 is a prime number, so maybe it's a result of combining some larger numbers through addition or subtraction. Let me start by looking at the numbers provided: 79, 73, 69, and 9.\n\nFirst, let me note that 79 and 73 are both primes and close to 80 and 70, respectively. 69 is 23*3, and 9 is 3 squared. The target is 773. Let me think about possible combinations.\n\nSince 773 is a bit over 700, maybe if I can get two numbers in the hundreds and combine them. For example, if I can make 700 from two numbers and then add the remaining numbers to reach 773. Let's see.\n\nLooking at 79 and 73. If I subtract them: 79 - 73 = 6. Not helpful. But if I add them: 79 + 73 = 152. Still low. Maybe multiply: 79 * 73. Let me calculate that. 79*70 is 5530, plus 79*3=237, so total 5530+237=5767. That's way too high. But maybe subtract something from that? Wait, but 5767 minus the other numbers (69 and 9) would be way more than 773. So that's probably not the way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use multiplication on some numbers and addition/subtraction on others. For instance, 79 * 9 = 711. Then 711 plus something. Let's see, 711 + 73 = 784. Then 784 - 69 = 715. No. Not close. Or 711 + 69 = 780, minus 73 = 707. Still not 773.\n\nWait, 79*9=711. 773-711=62. Do I have 62 with the remaining numbers 73 and 69? Hmm, 73 - 69 = 4. Not 62. 73 - (69/ something). Wait, 69 divided by something. 69/9 is 7.666..., but 73 - (69/9) would be 73 - 7.666... ≈ 65.333. If I add that to 711, that's ≈776.333. Close but not exact.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 79*10 is 790. But I don't have a 10. Wait, 9 + (something). Let me think differently.\n\nWhat if I use 73 and 9? 73*9=657. Then 773 - 657=116. Do I have 116 with 79 and 69? 79 + 69=148. 148 - something... but I can't use subtraction here since I can only use each number once. Wait, 79 + 69 is 148, which is more than 116. If I could subtract 32 from 148 to get 116, but I don't have 32. Alternatively, maybe divide 79 and 69 somehow. 79/69 is approximately 1.144. Not helpful.\n\nAnother approach: 69 * 9 = 621. Then 773 - 621=152. Then 152 is 79 +73=152. So 621 + 79 +73. But wait, that uses 69, 9, 79, 73. All four numbers. But the way to write this would be 69*9 +79 +73. Let's check: 69*9=621, 621+79=700, 700+73=773. That works! Wait, but does that use all the numbers once each? Yes: 69, 9, 79, 73. All used. So the equation is 69*9 +79 +73=773. Let me verify:\n\n69*9=621. 621+79=700. 700+73=773. Yes! So that works. So the equation is (69*9) +79 +73 =773. But how do I write it? Since multiplication has higher precedence, maybe 69*9 +79 +73. But according to the problem's example, they use parentheses even if not necessary. But maybe better to write it as 69 * 9 + 79 + 73. But check the arithmetic again: 69*9=621. 621+79=700. 700+73=773. Exactly. So that's the equation. But wait, let me make sure that each number is used once. 69, 9,79,73—yes, all four are used. Perfect. So that's the solution.\n</think>\n\n<answer>69 * 9 + 79 + 73 = 773</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using the numbers 14, 54, 50, and 25 exactly once each, with basic operations, to get 15. Hmm. Let me start by thinking about possible combinations.\n\nFirst, maybe I can look for numbers that can subtract or divide to get close to 15. Let's see, 50 divided by something... 50 divided by 25 is 2, but that's too low. 54 divided by something? 54 divided by 3 is 18, but how do I get a 3? Maybe using 25 minus 14? Because 25 - 14 is 11. Wait, not 3. Maybe 14 and 25. 25 minus 14 is 11. Hmm. Maybe 54 divided by (25 - 14) would be 54 / 11, which is about 4.9, not helpful.\n\nWhat if I try multiplying some numbers? 14 * 25 is 350. Then subtract 50 and 54? 350 - 50 -54 = 246. That's way off. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe using division and subtraction. Let's see, 50 divided by something. If I do 50 - (54 / (25 -14)). Let's compute that. 25-14 is 11. 54 /11 is about 4.91. Then 50 - 4.91 is around 45.09. Not 15.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 54 - 25 = 29, then 29 - 14 = 15. But then I still have 50 left. So that uses 54,25,14 but leaves out 50. So that doesn't work.\n\nWait, the problem says I must use all numbers. So I can't leave any out. So I need to use all four numbers in the equation.\n\nLet me think again. Maybe combining operations. Let's try to get 15 by combining two numbers and then using the other two. For example, if I can get 15 from two numbers and the other two numbers somehow cancel out or equal 1. But since all numbers must be used, maybe something like (a + b) - (c / d) =15.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (a - b) * (c / d) =15.\n\nLet me try different combinations. Let's list possible pairs:\n\n14 and 54: 14+54=68, 54-14=40, 54/14≈3.857, 14*54=756.\n\n50 and 25: 50+25=75, 50-25=25, 50/25=2, 50*25=1250.\n\nHmm. Maybe if I can get 75 (from 50+25) and then subtract 60 (from 54+14). 75 - 60=15. But 50+25=75, 54+14=68. 75-68=7. Not 15. Alternatively, 75 divided by something. 75 /5=15. How to get 5? Maybe 54 - 50=4, 14-4=10. Not sure.\n\nWait, 54 - (50 / (25 -14)). Let's compute that. 25-14=11. 50/11≈4.545. 54 -4.545≈49.455. Not 15.\n\nWhat if I do (54 - 50) * (25 -14). That's 4 *11=44. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, (50 - (54 / 14)) * something. 54/14≈3.857. 50 -3.857≈46.143. Then multiplied by what? Maybe 25 - something. Not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps using division and multiplication. Let's see, maybe (54 / 50) * (25 -14). 54/50=1.08, 25-14=11. 1.08 *11≈11.88. Close but not 15.\n\nAnother approach: 25 -14=11. Then 50 -54= -4. So 11 + (-4)=7. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe (25 - (54 / 50)) -14. Let's compute: 54/50=1.08. 25 -1.08=23.92. 23.92 -14≈9.92. Not 15.\n\nHmm. Maybe combining three numbers first. Let's think about 25,14,54. 25 -14=11. 54/11≈4.909. Then 50 -4.909≈45.09. Not 15.\n\nAlternatively, 50 /25=2. Then 2 *14=28. 54 -28=26. Not 15.\n\nWait, 54 - (50 / (25 -14)) =54 - (50/11)=54≈4.545≈54-4.545=49.455. Not helpful.\n\nWhat if I do 25 * (14 - (54/50))? Let's see: 54/50=1.08. 14-1.08=12.92. 25*12.92≈323. Not close.\n\nAlternatively, (54 -50) + (25 -14) =4 +11=15. Wait, that's 15! But here I have used 54,50,25,14. But each operation uses two numbers. Wait, let's see:\n\n(54 -50) + (25 -14) = (4) + (11) =15. But each number is used once. So that's 54,50,25,14. All used. The operations are two subtractions and one addition. So the equation would be (54 -50) + (25 -14) =15. Let me check: 54-50=4, 25-14=11. 4+11=15. Yes! That works. So the equation is (54 -50) + (25 -14) =15. Let me verify all numbers are used: 54,50,25,14. All four. Operations used: subtraction and addition. Each number once. Perfect.\n\nSo the answer is (54 - 50) + (25 - 14) =15. But I need to write it as an equation using all numbers with operations. Let me make sure the order is correct. Yes, all numbers are there once, and the operations are -, -, +.

I need to use the numbers 52, 41, 58, and 58 each exactly once, along with basic arithmetic operations, to make 93. Hmm. Let me start by thinking about possible combinations.\n\nFirst, 93 is a bit less than 100, so maybe combining larger numbers and subtracting or something. Let's list the numbers again: 52, 41, 58, 58. Two 58s. Maybe using the two 58s together? Like 58 + 58 is 116. Then subtract something. Let's see, 116 - 52 = 64, which isn't 93. 116 - 41 = 75. Still not. Hmm. Alternatively, multiplying. 58 * something. Let's see 58*2 is 116, but we don't have a 2. Wait, but maybe 58*(something). Wait, but the other numbers are 52, 41. Alternatively, maybe 58 + (something). Let's try adding 58 and 41. 58+41=99. Then if I subtract 6, that's 93. But where do I get 6 from? The remaining numbers are 52 and 58. 58-52=6. So putting that together: 58 + 41 + (58 - 52) = 58 +41 +6= 105. No, that's too much. Wait, maybe 58 +41 is 99, then subtract (58-52) which is 6, so 99 -6=93. Let me check that. So 58 +41 =99, then subtract (58 -52)=6, so 99-6=93. Yes! Let's verify all numbers are used once: 58,41,58,52. Yes, each number is used exactly once. So the equation would be 58 +41 - (58 -52) =93. Let's compute that step by step: 58-52 is 6, then 58+41 is 99, 99-6=93. Yes! That works. Let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's another way. Let me think again. Another approach: 52 +41 is 93. But then how to use the two 58s? If I have 52 +41 =93, but then I need to use the two 58s. Maybe subtract and add them? Like 52 +41 +58 -58. But that's 93 +0=93. But wait, that's using all numbers: 52,41,58,58. So that's 52 +41 +58 -58=93. But wait, the two 58s cancel each other out. So 52 +41 =93, and then +58 -58=0. So the equation is 52 +41 +58 -58 =93. That also works, but is that allowed? The problem says each number can only be used once. Since there are two 58s, using each once is okay. So that's another possible equation. Hmm. Which one is better? The first one uses the numbers in a way that combines them more actively, whereas the second one is simpler but effectively just adding 52 and 41. The problem might prefer the first approach since it uses all numbers in a non-trivial way. But according to the problem statement, both are valid. Wait, let's check the problem again. It says: \"create an equation that equals 93. You can use basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) one or multiple times but each number can only be used once, and you must use all the numbers.\" So in the second equation, all numbers are used once (including both 58s), so that's acceptable. However, the problem might consider the two 58s as separate numbers even though they are the same. But since they are both given in the input, using each once is allowed. So both equations are correct. But which one should I choose? Let me check which equation is more efficient. The first one is 58 +41 - (58 -52) =93. The second is 52 +41 +58 -58=93. The second one might be considered less creative, but still valid. Let me check if the problem prefers one over the other. The user might have intended a solution that doesn't just cancel out two numbers, but I don't know. Both are correct. So perhaps either is acceptable. Let me confirm the calculations again. For the first equation: 58 +41 =99, 58-52=6, 99-6=93. Correct. Second equation: 52+41=93, 58-58=0, so 93+0=93. Correct. So both equations are valid. But the second one uses the numbers in a way that two of them cancel each other out, which might be considered less optimal. Maybe the first one is preferred. So the answer could be either. Let me write both and see which one to present. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the first one. I'll go with the first one because it uses all numbers in a non-canceling way.\n</think>\n\n<answer>58 + 41 - (58 - 52) = 93</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using all the numbers 45, 84, 6, and 3 exactly once, and the result should be 210. The operations allowed are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Hmm, where to start?\n\nFirst, I should think about the target number, 210. Let's break it down into factors to see if that helps. 210 is 21 times 10, or 42 times 5, or 70 times 3, etc. Wait, 210 divided by 45 is about 4.666, which might not be helpful. Alternatively, maybe 84 is a key number here because 84 multiplied by something could get close to 210. Let me check: 84 times 2.5 is 210. But 2.5 isn't one of the numbers. Hmm.\n\nLooking at the numbers provided: 45, 84, 6, 3. Let's list possible combinations. Maybe combining 84 and 45? 84 plus 45 is 129, which is way below 210. 84 minus 45 is 39, not helpful. 84 multiplied by 45 is way too big (3780). Divided? 84/45 is around 1.866. Not helpful. So maybe multiplication isn't the way to go here with those two.\n\nWhat about 84 multiplied by 2.5 equals 210. Wait, how can I get 2.5 from the remaining numbers? The remaining numbers are 45, 6, 3. Let's see: 6 divided by something. 6 divided by (3/ something). Wait, 45 divided by 6 is 7.5. Hmm, 84 times (45 divided by 6) would be 84 * 7.5 = 630. That's too big. Alternatively, 84 multiplied by (6 - (45/3))? Let's compute that: 45 divided by 3 is 15, 6 - 15 is -9, so 84 * (-9) is -756. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe 84 plus 45 is 129. Then 129 multiplied by something. The remaining numbers are 6 and 3. 6 times 3 is 18. 129 * 18 is way over. Alternatively, 129 divided by something. 129 divided by (6/3) is 129 divided by 2, which is 64.5. Not 210.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of division. If 210 can be achieved by dividing two numbers. But 84 divided by something? Not sure. Let's think of combining operations. Maybe 45 * 6 = 270. Then subtract 84 divided by 3. 84/3 is 28. 270 - 28 = 242. Not 210. Hmm. Or 45 * 6 = 270, subtract 84 - 3 = 81. 270 -81=189. Not 210.\n\nWhat about 84 * 3 = 252. Then subtract 45 -6=39. 252 -39=213. Close, but not 210. Or 84*3=252, subtract (45/6)=7.5. 252 -7.5=244.5. No.\n\nWait, 84 * (6 - (45/3)). Let's compute that: 45/3=15. 6-15= -9. 84 * (-9)= -756. Nope.\n\nHow about 45 - 3 =42. Then 84 +6=90. 42 * 90=3780. Too big. Alternatively, 84 * (45 / (6 +3)). Let's see: 6+3=9. 45/9=5. 84*5=420. Oh, that's double the target. Wait, but 420 is 210 times 2. Maybe I can adjust. If I take half of that, but how? I can't use division again because the numbers are already used. Wait, 45/(6+3)=5. Then 84 *5=420. But that uses 45,6,3 and 84. So all numbers are used. But 420 is double of 210. Hmm. How to get 210. Maybe split the multiplication. Wait, can I do something else with the numbers.\n\nAlternatively, 45 * 6 =270. Then 270 - (84 /3) =270 -28=242. Not 210. Hmm.\n\nWait, 210 is 84 * 2.5. How can I get 2.5 from 45,6,3? Let's see: 45 divided by (6*3) is 45/18=2.5. Yes! So 84 * (45/(6*3)). Let's check that. 6*3=18. 45/18=2.5. 84*2.5=210. That works. Let me verify the numbers: 84,45,6,3. All used once. And operations are multiplication and division. So the equation would be 84 * (45 / (6 * 3)) =210.\n\nYes, that should work. Let me compute it step by step. 6*3=18. Then 45 divided by 18 is 2.5. Then 84 multiplied by 2.5 is indeed 210. Perfect. So the equation is 84 × (45 ÷ (6 × 3)) =210. All numbers used once with multiplication and division operations.\n</think>\n\n<answer>84 * (45 / (6 * 3)) = 210</answer>"}]}

All numbers must be used once, and only basic operations. Hmm. Let me start by thinking about possible combinations.\n\nFirst, 630 is a multiple of 70, like 70*9=630. Maybe I can get close to that. Let's check the numbers. 72 is close to 70. If I could multiply 72 by something, but 72 times 9 is 648, which is too high. But maybe subtract something? Not sure.\n\nWait, 92 is a larger number. Maybe subtract some combination from 92? Let's see. Alternatively, maybe divide. 72 divided by something? Let's think about possible factors of 630. 630 divided by 72 is 8.75. That's not helpful. How about 630 divided by 92? That's around 6.84. Hmm. Not sure.\n\nAnother approach: maybe combine some numbers first. For example, 92 minus 35 equals 57. Then use 57 with 72 and 23. Not sure. 57 + 23 = 80. Then 72 + 80 = 152. Not close.\n\nAlternatively, 23 + 35 = 58. Then 92 - 58 = 34. Then 34 * 72 = 2448. Way too big.\n\nWait, maybe multiply larger numbers. 72 * 92 is 6624. That's way over. So division might be necessary. What if we divide 72 by something? Let's see. 72 divided by 23 is about 3.13. Then multiply by 35? 3.13*35=109.55. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 92 divided by 23 is 4. Then 4 * 35 = 140. Then 72 + 140 = 212. No, not 630.\n\nWait, perhaps combine 72 and 35 first. 72 + 35 = 107. Then 107 * (something). 630 / 107 ≈ 5.89. Not helpful. Or 72 - 35 = 37. 37 * (something). 630 /37 ≈17.027. Maybe combine 92 and 23. 92 -23=69. 37*69=2553. No.\n\nAlternatively, multiply 72 by 23. 72*23=1656. Then divide by something. 1656 /35≈47.31. Not helpful. Hmm.\n\nWait, 35 is a factor of 630. 630 divided by 35 is 18. So if I can get 18 from the other numbers, then 35*18=630. Let's try that. So 18 from 72, 92, and 23. How?\n\nMaybe 92 -72 =20. Then 20 - (23 - something). Wait, 20 -2=18. But how to get 2? Maybe 23 divided by something. 23 is a prime number. 23 divided by 23 is 1. Not helpful. Alternatively, 92 - (72 +23) = 92-95= -3. No. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, (72 + 23) - 92 = 95 -92=3. Then 3 * something? 3*35=105. Not 630.\n\nWait, if I need 18, maybe (92 - 72) - (23 - x). Not sure. Let me try another approach.\n\nWhat if I do 92 - 23 = 69. Then 69 * something. 630 /69≈9.13. So 9.13 is about 35/3.8. Not helpful. Or 72 -35=37. 37*17=629. Close, but not 630. 37*17=629, but how to get 17 from 92 and 23? 92-23*4=92-92=0. No.\n\nAlternatively, 72 * 9 = 648. 648 - 18 =630. How to get 18 from 92,23,35. 92-23-35=34. Not 18. 35-23=12. 92/12=7.666... Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe (92 - (35 -23)) =92-12=80. Then 72 *80=5760. No. Not helpful.\n\nAnother angle: 630=70*9. So if I can get 70 and 9 from the numbers. 70 could be 72 -2. How to get 2? Maybe 35/23≈1.52. Not 2. Alternatively, 23 - (92-72)=23-20=3. Not 2.\n\nHmm. Maybe 92 - (35 +23)=92-58=34. Then 34 +72=106. 106*6=636. Close. Not 630.\n\nAlternatively, 35*18=630. So need 18. Let's think again. Maybe (72/(92-23)) *35. 92-23=69. 72/69≈1.043. 1.043*35≈36.5. Not 18.\n\nWait, 72 divided by (something) equals 18. 72/4=18. So if I can get 4 from 92,23,35. How? 92 divided by 23 is 4. Yes! So 72/(92/23) =72/4=18. Then 18*35=630. That works!\n\nSo the equation is (72 / (92 /23)) *35 =630. Let me check:\n\nFirst, 92 divided by23 is4. Then 72 divided by4 is18. Then 18 multiplied by35 is630. Yes! All numbers used once. Perfect.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(72 / (92 / 23)) * 35</answer>"}]}

I need to make an equation using all the numbers 45, 90, 56, and 17 exactly once with basic operations to get 476. Hmm, let's start by thinking about how these numbers can combine. \n\nFirst, 476 is a pretty large number. The numbers I have are 45, 90, 56, 17. Let me check if multiplying some of them could get close. For example, 90 is the largest here. If I multiply 90 by something. Let's see 90*5=450, which is close to 476. But I don't have a 5. Wait, maybe 90*5. How else can I get 5? Maybe using 45 and 17? 45 divided by something. 45 divided by 9 is 5, but I don't have a 9. Alternatively, maybe 45 minus 17 is 28. Not helpful. \n\nWait, 56 and 17. 56 minus 17 is 39. Not sure. Alternatively, 56 divided by something. 56/17 is about 3.29. Maybe that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 45 multiplied by 10 is 450, but I don't have a 10. How can I get a 10? 90 divided by 9 is 10. But again, no 9. Hmm. Maybe 90 divided by (45/5) would be 10, but that's using numbers I don't have. \n\nWait, perhaps combining 90 and 56. 90 +56 is 146. Then 146 * something. 146*3=438, which is less than 476. 146*3.26=476, but that's messy. \n\nAlternatively, 90*5. Let's think again. 90*5. If I can create 5 from the other numbers. Let's see, 45 divided by (17 - 8) is 5, but no 8. Alternatively, 56 - 45 =11, 17 -11=6. Not helpful. \n\nWait, maybe 90*5.29 would be 476. But how to get 5.29. Not sure. Maybe not the right approach.\n\nAnother approach: 476 divided by 90 is about 5.29. So maybe 90 times (something) equals 476. Let's see, 476 ÷ 90 ≈ 5.288. So if I can make 5.288 from the remaining numbers. 45, 56, 17. Let's see, 56 divided by 17 is approximately 3.294. Then 3.294 + (45 divided by something). Wait, maybe 56/17 + 45/ something. Hmm, not obvious. \n\nAlternatively, maybe subtract something. Let's try 90*56 = 5040. That's way too big. Maybe 90*5. Let's try combining 45 and 17. 45 +17=62. 90*62=5580. Still way too big. \n\nWait, perhaps I should look for 476 as a sum of products. For example, maybe 45*10 + 56 = 450 +56=506. Still not 476. Or 90*5 + 56= 450+56=506. Hmm. \n\nWait, 476. Let me factor 476. 476 divided by 4 is 119. So 4*119. But how to get 119. 119 is 17*7. So 17*7*4. But I don't have 7. Alternatively, 476=28*17. Let's check 28*17: 280 + 140=420, which is less than 476. No, 28*17=476? Wait, 17*28: 17*20=340, 17*8=136, so 340+136=476. Yes! So 17*28=476. So if I can make 28 from 45, 90, and 56. Wait, but those three numbers. Let's see. 56 is already there. 56 divided by 2 is 28. How to get 2. Maybe 90 divided by 45 is 2. So 56/(90/45) =56/2=28. Then 17* (56/(90/45)) =17*28=476. That works! Let me check:\n\n90 divided by 45 is 2. Then 56 divided by 2 is 28. 28 multiplied by 17 is 476. Yes! So putting it all together: 17 * (56 / (90 /45)) =17*(56/2)=17*28=476. \n\nLet me verify each step. 90 divided by 45 is 2. Then 56 divided by that 2 is 28. Multiply by 17 gives 476. Perfect. And all numbers are used once: 17, 56, 90, 45. So the equation is 17 * (56 / (90 / 45)) = 476. \n\nAlternatively, written with parentheses: 17 * (56 / (90 ÷ 45)). That's the equation. Let me check if all operations are allowed. Yes, division and multiplication. Each number used once. Yep, that works.\n</think>\n\n<answer>17 * (56 / (90 / 45))</answer>"}]}

Each number must be used exactly once, and I can use basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division. The result should be 87. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I notice that 87 is one of the target numbers and also one of the numbers given. So maybe I can somehow get 87 by using the other three numbers and then add or subtract the remaining 87. But wait, the problem says I have to use all the numbers. So if 87 is part of the equation, I need to use the other three numbers (84, 77, 7) to get to zero or something that when combined with 87 gives 87. For example, 87 + (something - something) = 87. But I need to use all four numbers. Wait, no, 87 is already one of the numbers. So perhaps combine the other three numbers in a way that when you add or subtract to 87, you still get 87. That would require that the other three numbers' combination equals zero. Let's check if that's possible.\n\nSo using 84, 77, and 7 to make zero. Let's see. Maybe 84 - 77 - 7 = 0? 84 minus 77 is 7, then minus 7 is zero. Yes! So then if I do 87 + (84 - 77 - 7) = 87 + 0 = 87. That would work. Let me check if that uses all numbers: 87 is used, 84, 77, and 7 are all used. Each once. So the equation would be 87 + (84 - 77 - 7) = 87. Wait, but in the problem statement, it says to create an equation that equals 87. So perhaps the equation is (84 - 77 - 7) + 87 = 87. But maybe parentheses are needed. Let me verify the calculation step by step.\n\n84 - 77 = 7. Then 7 - 7 = 0. Then adding 87 gives 87. So yes, that works. But let me check if there's another way. Maybe multiplication or division could help. For example, maybe 77 divided by 7 is 11, then 84 minus 11 is 73. Then 73 + something? But I need to use all numbers. Alternatively, 84 divided by 7 is 12. Then 77 minus 12 is 65. Not helpful. Let's see. Another approach: 84 + 77 = 161. Then 161 divided by something. But we need to use 7 and 87. Not sure. Alternatively, 87 - (something) where the something is zero. But same idea as before. Let me check another possibility. 77 - (84 / (something)). For example, 77 - (84 / 7) = 77 - 12 = 65. Then 65 + something? Not helpful. 87 is needed. Alternatively, 84 - (77 / 7) = 84 - 11 = 73. Then 73 + 14? But where do I get 14. Wait, no. I need to use all numbers. So if I do 84 - (77 / 7) = 73, then how to get 87 from 73 and 87? Maybe 73 + 14 = 87, but where would 14 come from? Not possible. Alternatively, 77 divided by 7 is 11, then 84 - 11 = 73. Then 73 + 14 = 87, but I don't have a 14. So maybe that's not the way. Let me go back to the initial idea. The first approach uses all numbers and gives exactly 87. So maybe that's the answer. Let me write it as 87 + (84 - 77 - 7). But need to check the order of operations. Parentheses are important. So (84 - 77 -7) is zero, then plus 87. So the equation would be 87 + (84 - 77 - 7) = 87. Alternatively, (84 - 77) -7 +87. Without parentheses, the operations would be left to right. Let's check: 84 -77 is 7, then 7 -7 is 0, then 0 +87 is 87. So maybe parentheses aren't necessary. So the equation could be 84 -77 -7 +87 =87. Let's verify: 84 -77 is 7, 7-7 is 0, 0+87 is 87. Yes, that works. So the equation would be 84 -77 -7 +87 =87. But does that use all numbers? 84,77,7,87. Yes, each once. So that's a valid equation. Alternatively, the same numbers can be arranged in different order, but the result would still be the same. For example, 87 +84 -77 -7. That would also compute to 87. Let me check: 87 +84 is 171, minus77 is 94, minus7 is 87. Yes. So that's another way. So the equation could be 87 +84 -77 -7 =87. Either way, it works. So either form would be acceptable. So the answer would be either (84 -77 -7) +87 =87 or 87 +84 -77 -7=87. Both are correct. Let me check if the problem requires all numbers to be used, which they are. And each operation is allowed. Yes. So this should work.\n</think>\n\n<answer>87 + 84 - 77 - 7 = 87</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using all the numbers 42, 99, 57, and 1 exactly once, and the result should be 1. Hmm, let's start by thinking about possible operations. Since 1 is one of the numbers, maybe I can use it in a subtraction or division to get 1. For example, if I can make a fraction that equals 2, then subtract 1, but wait, maybe there's a better way.\n\nAnother thought: 1 is the identity element for multiplication and division. So maybe multiplying by 1 somewhere won't change the result. But how to get the other numbers to cancel out to 1. Let's think about division. If I can have two numbers that when divided give 1, but I need to use all four numbers. Wait, maybe pair them into two fractions that multiply or subtract to 1.\n\nFor example, (42/42) is 1, but I don't have two 42s. Alternatively, maybe 57 - 56 =1, but 56 isn't in the numbers. Alternatively, 99 - 98 =1, but again, 98 isn't there. Maybe using division: 57/57 is 1, but again, can't do that. Alternatively, (99 - 42) is 57. Oh, that's interesting. If I have 99 - 42 = 57, then maybe 57 divided by 57 is 1. But then I still have the 1 left. Wait, how?\n\nWait, let me try to structure it. Let's say (99 - 42) =57, so that uses 99,42,57. Then I have 57 left (but I already used 57 once) and 1. Wait, no, each number can be used only once. So that approach might not work. Hmm.\n\nAlternative idea: Use multiplication and division. Maybe 57 - (42 / something) =1. Let's see. Suppose I do 57 - (42/x) =1. Then 42/x =56, so x=42/56= 0.75. But I don't have 0.75. Alternatively, maybe (99 divided by something) minus something else equals 1.\n\nWait, perhaps combining numbers with subtraction and division. For example, (99 - 57) =42. Then 42 divided by 42 is 1, but again, how to include the remaining 1. Wait, if I do (99 - 57)/42 -1 = (42/42) -1 = 1-1=0. Not helpful. Alternatively, (99 -57)/42 +1 =1+1=2. No. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe ((57 - 42) / (99 - something)) +1. Let's see. 57-42=15. Then 15 divided by (99 - x). If x is 99-15=84, but 84 isn't in the numbers. Maybe that's not the way.\n\nWait, perhaps using multiplication and division. Let's try (99 / (57 - 42)) -1. Let's compute denominator first:57-42=15. Then 99/15=6.6, minus 1=5.6. Not 1. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe (99 / (57 - 42)) - (1 * something). But I can't use numbers more than once. Wait, all numbers must be used once. So need to use 1 in some way.\n\nAnother approach: 57 - 42 =15. Then 99 divided by 15 is 6.6. If I subtract 5.6, but I don't have that. Alternatively, maybe 99 divided by something equals 1. But 99 divided by 99 is 1, but then I have to use 42,57, and 1. Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe 1 is the result of operations between the other numbers. For example, (42 / (99 - 57)) + 1. Let's compute denominator:99-57=42. Then 42/42=1. Then 1 +1=2. Not 1. Close, but not quite.\n\nAlternatively, (42 / (99 - 57)) * 1. That would be 1 *1=1. Wait, but that uses 42,99,57, and 1. Let me check: 99-57=42. Then 42 divided by that 42 is 1. Multiply by 1. So equation is ((99 -57)/42) *1. Wait, but the original numbers are 42,99,57,1. So arranging the numbers, perhaps ((99 -57)/42) *1 =1. But the problem is that the numbers have to be used once each. So the equation would be (99 -57)/42 *1. That uses all four numbers. Let's check: 99-57=42. 42/42=1. 1*1=1. Yes, that works. So the equation is ((99 - 57) / 42) * 1 =1. So that uses all four numbers once each. Let me verify:\n\n99 -57 =42\n\n42 /42 =1\n\n1 *1 =1.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the equation is (99 -57)/42 *1 =1. But according to the problem's example, the answer should be in parentheses as needed, like (1 + 2)/3. So here, maybe we can write it as ((99 - 57) / 42) * 1. Alternatively, (99 -57)/42 *1. Either way, but the multiplication by 1 is redundant. So maybe (99 -57)/42 +1 -1, but that would use 1 twice. No, can't. So the simplest is ((99 -57)/42) *1. That uses all four numbers once. Let me check each number: 99,57,42,1. Yes. The operations are subtraction, division, multiplication. Each used once (but allowed to use multiple times as per the problem statement). Wait, the problem says \"You can use basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) one or multiple times but each number can only be used once, and you must use all the numbers.\"\n\nSo operations can be used multiple times. So the equation (99 -57)/42 *1 =1 works. Let me make sure that's the case. Yes, all numbers are used once, and the result is 1. That should be the answer.\n</think>\n\n<answer>((99 - 57) / 42) * 1</answer>"}]}

All numbers must be used once, and only basic operations: +, -, *, /. Hmm. Let me start by thinking about the target number, 687. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, 569 is the largest number here. Maybe I can use that as a starting point. If I subtract something from 569, what would get me close to 687? Wait, 569 is less than 687, so subtracting would take me further away. Maybe adding. Let's see: 569 + something. Let's check the other numbers: 5, 34, 89. If I add 569 + 89, that's 658. Then I still have 34 and 5 left. 658 +34 is 692, then subtract 5 would be 687. Wait, that might work. Let me check:\n\n569 + 89 = 658. Then 658 +34 = 692. Then 692 -5 = 687. So that would be 569 +89 +34 -5. But let me verify the order. Because all numbers are used once. So that uses all four numbers. Let me compute that step by step:\n\n569 +89 is 658.\n\n658 +34 is 692.\n\n692 -5 is 687. Yes, that adds up. So the equation would be 569 +89 +34 -5. But I need to make sure that the operations are combined correctly with parentheses if necessary. Wait, addition and subtraction are left associative, so as written, it would work without parentheses. But let me check if that's allowed. Since all operations are addition and subtraction, the order doesn't matter as long as you go left to right. So 569 +89 is 658, plus 34 is 692, minus 5 is 687. That's correct.\n\nBut wait, are there other ways? Let me make sure there's no other combination. Maybe multiplying. For example, 34 * something. 34*20 is 680, which is close. But how to get 20 from the remaining numbers. 5, 89, 569. Hmm. 569 divided by 89 is approximately 6.4, which isn't helpful. 89 -5 =84, 84 divided by 34 is about 2.47. Not helpful. Maybe 34* (5 + something). Let's see. 5 + 89 is 94. 34*94 is 3196, which is way too big. 34*5 is 170. 170 +569 is 739. Then subtract 89 and 34? Wait, but we already used 34. Wait, no, each number can be used once. So maybe 34*5 + 569 -89. Let's compute that: 34*5=170. 170+569=739. 739-89=650. Not 687. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, 89*5 is 445. 445 +569=1014. Then subtract 34 and something else. But we already used 5, 89, 569. The remaining number is 34. So 1014 -34=980. Not helpful.\n\nAnother approach: 569 + (34 *5) = 569 +170=739. Then 739 -89=650. Still not enough. Hmm.\n\nWhat if we do 89 * (34 -5). Let's see: 34-5=29. 89*29=2581. That's way over. Then subtract 569? 2581-569=2012. No good.\n\nAlternatively, 34 * (89 -5) =34*84=2856. That's way too big. Then subtract 569? 2856-569=2287. Still too big.\n\nAnother idea: 569 - 34 =535. Then 535 +89=624. Then 624 +5=629. Not close.\n\nWait, maybe using division. Let's see. 569 divided by 5 is about 113.8. 113.8 +34 +89=236.8. Nope. Not close. How about 89 divided by 34. That's approximately 2.617. 569 +5 +2.617=576.617. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 569 divided by something. Maybe 569/(5) =113.8, then 113.8 * 34=3870. Then 3870 -89=3781. No.\n\nWait, maybe a different approach. Let's think of 687 as 680 +7. How can we get 680 and 7. 34*20 is 680. So 34*20 +7. But how to get 20 and 7 from 5,89,569. Maybe 569 -89=480. 480 /5=96. Hmm. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 5*7=35. But 34 is close. Not sure.\n\nWait, going back to the first idea: 569 +89=658. Then +34=692. Then -5=687. That seems to work. Let's check again:\n\n569 +89 = 658. 658 +34 =692. 692 -5=687. Yes. All numbers used once. So the equation is 569 +89 +34 -5. But do I need parentheses? Since addition and subtraction are left associative, so it's evaluated as ((569 +89) +34) -5. Which is correct. So the equation would be written as 569 + 89 + 34 - 5. That's valid. Let me check if there's any other possible way, but this seems straightforward and works. So maybe that's the answer.\n</think>\n\n<answer>569 + 89 + 34 - 5</answer>"}]}

Let me start by thinking about what operations could lead to a larger number like 735. Since multiplication tends to give bigger results, maybe that's the way to go.\n\nFirst, let's see the target: 735. If I factorize 735, it's 5*147, which is 5*3*49, or 5*3*7^2. Hmm, not sure if that helps directly, but maybe I can find combinations that multiply to this.\n\nLooking at the numbers given: 28, 32, 60, 14. Let's list them again: 28 is 4*7, 32 is 2^5, 60 is 12*5, and 14 is 2*7. Maybe I can pair them in a way that their products or sums get close.\n\nIf I try multiplying the two largest numbers first: 60 and 32. 60*32 is 1920. That's way over 735. Maybe divide that by something. If I take 60*32 and then divide by one of the other numbers, like 28 or 14. Let's see: 1920 /28 is approximately 68.57, which isn't helpful. 1920/14 is around 137.14. Still not close. Maybe subtract something? 60*32 =1920. 1920 - (28 +14) = 1920 -42= 1878. No, that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use 60 and 28. 60*28 is 1680. Then, 1680 divided by something. 1680/32=52.5, 1680/14=120. Not 735. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe combining addition and multiplication. Let's think: 60 is a big number. If I can multiply 60 by something to get close. Let's see, 60*12=720, which is close to 735. But how to get 12 from the remaining numbers? The remaining numbers are 28,32,14. Let's see: 28 - (32/14) = 28 - 2.285≈25.714. Not helpful. 32 - (28/14)=32-2=30. Then 60*30=1800, which is way over. Alternatively, 28 +32 +14=74, which doesn't help.\n\nWait, maybe 60*(something) + something else. Let's think. If I have 60*12=720, then 720 +15=735. Where can I get 12 and 15 from the remaining numbers? The remaining numbers are 28,32,14. 32 - (28 -14)=32 -14=18. Not 12 or 15. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, 60*14=840. Then 840 - (32* something). Let's see, 840 - (32*3)=840-96=744. Close. But 3 isn't available. 32*28=896. 840-896= -56. Not helpful.\n\nWait another approach: Maybe divide two numbers to get a fraction that can help. For instance, 32/14 is approximately 2.2857. If I multiply that by 60, 60*(32/14)=60*2.2857≈137.14. Then multiply by 28: 137.14*28≈3840. Way too big.\n\nAlternatively, 60/(32/14) =60*(14/32)=60*0.4375=26.25. Then 26.25*28=735. Oh! Wait, let me check that again. Let me write it step by step.\n\nIf I take 60 divided by (32 divided by 14). That is 60 / (32/14) = 60 * (14/32) = (60*14)/32 = 840/32 = 26.25. Then, multiply that by 28: 26.25 *28. Let's compute that. 26*28=728, 0.25*28=7, so total is 735. Yes! That works. But wait, did I use all the numbers? Let me see. The numbers used are 60, 32,14, and 28. Yes, all four numbers are used once. So the equation would be (60 / (32 /14)) *28 =735. Let me check the order of operations. The division is done first: 32 divided by 14, then 60 divided by that result, then multiplied by 28. Let me compute step by step:\n\n32 divided by 14 is approximately 2.2857. Then 60 divided by 2.2857 is approximately 26.25. 26.25 multiplied by 28 is exactly 735. So yes, that works.\n\nSo the equation is (60 / (32 / 14)) * 28 =735. To write this with all numbers used once and operations, let me structure it properly. The operations are division of 32 by 14, then division of 60 by that result, then multiplication by 28. So the equation can be written as (60 / (32 / 14)) * 28. But according to the problem, we need to use each number once. Let me confirm: 60, 32,14,28 are all used once. Correct. And all operations are allowed. So this should be the answer.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(60 / (32 / 14)) * 28</answer>"}]}

I need to use all four numbers: 47, 55, 68, and 94, each exactly once, and combine them with basic arithmetic operations to get 15. Hmm, 15 is a relatively small number, so maybe subtraction or division will be involved here. Let me start by thinking about possible combinations.\n\nFirst, maybe I should try to pair the larger numbers in a way that their difference or division could bring down the value. For example, 94 is the largest number. If I subtract something from it, maybe that helps. Let's try 94 minus 68. That gives me 26. Then I have 55 and 47 left. Wait, 26 is still bigger than 15. If I do 55 divided by something? Let's see, 55 divided by 47 is a little over 1. So 26 minus 1 would be 25, which isn't 15. That doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 94 divided by something. Let's try 94 divided by 47. That's 2. Then I have 55, 68 left. If I subtract 55 from 68, that's 13. Then 2 + 13 = 15. Wait, let me check that again. So 94 / 47 is 2. Then 68 - 55 is 13. Then adding those two results: 2 + 13 = 15. Oh, that works! Let me verify the numbers are used once each. Yes, 94,47 for division, 68 and 55 for subtraction. All four numbers are used once. So the equation would be (94 / 47) + (68 - 55) = 15. Let's compute each part: 94 divided by 47 is 2, 68 minus 55 is 13, and 2 + 13 is 15. Perfect! That seems to work.\n\nWait, but the problem requires using each number exactly once. Let me confirm: 94, 47, 68, 55 are all used. Yep, each is used once. Operations are division, subtraction, and addition. So the equation is (94 / 47) + (68 - 55) = 15. That should be the correct answer. I think that's it.

Wait, 80 divided by something. If I use 80 and 1, maybe 80 divided by something. 80 divided by (something) to get a number that when subtracted from 68 gives 13. Let's think: 68 - x = 13 → x = 55. So can I make 55 from 80 and 1? Hmm. 80 - 1 = 79, which is too big. 80 + 1 = 81. Not helpful. 80 * 1 = 80. 80 / 1 =80. No. Wait, maybe 80 - (1 * something else?), but I've already used all numbers. Wait, the numbers left are 1, 80, 68. Wait, maybe 68 - (80 / something). But 80 divided by what? If I use 1, 80 divided by 1 is 80. Then 68 - 80 = -12. Not helpful. Alternatively, maybe 80 - 68 = 12. Then 12 +1 =13. Ah! Wait, 80 -68 is 12, then adding 1 gives 13. So 80 -68 +1 =13. But wait, that uses 80, 68, and 1. So then, 43 * (80 -68 +1) =43*13=559.

Wait, 84 divided by 7 is 12, then 12 multiplied by (62 -53)=9. 12*9=108. Not 225.\n\nAnother approach: 225 is 15 squared. Maybe 15*15. But how to get 15 from these numbers. Let's see. 62 - 53 =9, 84/7=12. 9+12=21. Not 15. Hmm.\n\nWait, 62 + 7 =69. 84 - 53=31. 69 +31=100. Not helpful. Maybe subtract: 84 - (62/7) +53? Let's compute that. 62/7 is about 8.857. 84 -8.857 ≈75.143 +53=128.143. No.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 53 * something. 53*4=212. If I can get 212 +13=225. 13 from 62,7,84. Let's see. 62 - (84/7) =62-12=50. Not 13. 7 + 6=13? But how to get 6 from 62 and 84. 84-62=22. 22/something? No. Not helpful.\n\nWait, 225 divided by 53 is approximately 4.245. So maybe 53 multiplied by around 4.24. But how to get that with the other numbers. Let's see. 62 - (84/7) =62-12=50. 50/ something. 50/12≈4.166. Hmm, 53*(50/12)≈53*4.166≈221. Which is close but not exactly 225. Maybe not the right path.\n\nAnother thought: 84 * 3 =252. 252 -27=225. How to get 27 from 53,62,7. 53 - (62-7)=53-55= -2. No. 62 - (53+7)=62-60=2. Not 27. 7*3=21, but where's 3 from? 84 divided by 28=3, but 28 isn't here. Maybe 53 - 62 +7= -2. Not helpful.\n\nWait, 62*7=434. That's way too big. 434 -53=381. Still too big. 434 -84=350. No. 84*7=588. 588 -53=535. No. Maybe 62*3=186. 186 + 53=239. Close to 225 but not there. 239 -14=225. How to get 14 from 84 and 7. 84/7=12. 12+2=14. But where's 2? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, 84 * (62 -53) =84*9=756. Then 756 divided by 7 is 108. No. 756 minus something. 756 -531=225. But 531 is 53*10. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe 53 * (7 - (84/62)). Let's calculate that. 84 divided by 62 is approximately 1.3548. 7 -1.3548≈5.645. Then 53*5.645≈299. That's over.\n\nHmm. Maybe using subtraction and division. Let's see. 62 + 53 =115. 84 -7=77. 115 +77=192. Still low. 192 + something else? No, all numbers used.\n\nWait, perhaps (84 + 62) =146. Then 53*7=371. 371 -146=225. Wait, 53*7=371. Then 371 minus (84 +62)=146. 371-146=225. But does that use all numbers? Let's check: 53,7,84,62. Yes. Each used once. So the equation would be 53*7 - (84 +62) =225. Let's verify:\n\n53*7=371. 84+62=146. 371-146=225. Yes! That works. So the equation is 53*7 - (84 +62) =225. But wait, the numbers used are 53,7,84,62. All used once.

Let's look at the numbers: 63 is the largest, then 22, 6, and 3. Maybe if I multiply some of the bigger numbers together. Let's try 63 multiplied by something. If I do 63 * 22, that's 1386, which is way too big. So maybe that's not the right approach. What if I subtract something from that? But then I still have to use 3 and 6. Wait, 63 * 22 = 1386. If I subtract, say, 6*3 from that, that's 1386 - 18 = 1368. Still way too big. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe divide 63 by 3 first. That would give 21. Then multiply by 22? 21 * 22 = 462. Then add the 6? 462 + 6 = 468. Still not 492. Hmm. Alternatively, 63 divided by something else. Wait, maybe 63 * (22 - 6). Let's calculate that: 22 -6 is 16. 63*16 is 1008. Still too big.\n\nWhat if I use 22 and 3 together? 22*3 is 66. Then 66 multiplied by something. 66 * 6 is 396. Then add 63? 396 +63=459. No. Or 66 * 7.5 would be 495, but I don't have a 7.5. Alternatively, maybe 22* (6 + 3) =22*9=198. Then 198 + 63=261. Not close.\n\nWait, 492 divided by 6 is 82. So maybe if I can get 82 using 3, 22, 63. Let's see. 63 +22=85. 85 -3=82. So 6*(63 +22 -3) =6*82=492. Oh! That uses all the numbers: 6 multiplied by (63 +22 -3). Let's check: 63 +22 is 85, minus 3 is 82. 82 multiplied by 6 is 492. Yes! And all numbers are used once: 6, 63, 22, and 3. Perfect.\n</think>\n\n<answer>6 * (63 + 22 - 3) = 492</answer>"}]}

Let me start by thinking about factors of 300. 300 is 3 times 100, or 30 times 10, or 50 times 6, 15 times 20. Maybe I can combine these numbers in a way that multiplies to 300.\n\nSince 50 is a factor of 300 (50*6=300), maybe I can use 50 and another number. But how to get the 6? Wait, I have 10, 15, and 100 left. Let's see. 15 minus 10 is 5, but that's not helpful. 100 divided by something? 100 divided by 15 is not an integer. Hmm. Alternatively, 10 multiplied by something. 10 times 15 is 150. If I have 50 and 150, maybe 50 + 150 is 200, not 300. Or 50 * (something) equals 300. If I can make 6 from the remaining numbers. Wait, 100 divided by (15 - 10) is 100/5=20. Then 50*20=1000. That's too much. Alternatively, maybe 15 - 10 =5, then 100/5=20, then 20*15=300, but I already used 15 and 10. Wait, maybe I need to use all four numbers. Let me try again.\n\nAnother approach: combining operations. For example, 100 - 50 =50, then multiply by something. But I still need to use 10 and 15. Maybe (100 - 50) * (15 - 10) =50*5=250. Not 300. Close. What if it's (100 + 50) * (15 -10)=150*5=750. Still not. How about (100 - (15 -10)) *50? Wait, 15-10 is 5, so 100-5=95, 95*50=4750. No. Maybe 100 * 3 =300. How to get 3 from 50,15,10? 15 divided by (50/10)=15/5=3. Oh, that's a possibility. So 100 * (15 / (50 /10)) =100 * (15/5)=100*3=300. Let's check: 50 divided by 10 is 5, then 15 divided by 5 is 3, then 100 times 3 is 300. That uses all numbers: 10,50 in the division, 15, and 100. So the equation would be 100 * (15 / (50 / 10)) =300. Let me verify the order of operations. The innermost parentheses first: 50/10=5, then 15/5=3, then 100*3=300. Yes. So this works.

Let's see if I can break it down into factors or components that might relate to the numbers given. 450 divided by 10 is 45. Wait, 45 is a factor here. But do I have a 45? No, but maybe I can make 45 from the other numbers. Alternatively, 450 is 9*50, but again, not sure. Let's see the numbers available: 88, 10, 30, 63. Let's list them again: 88 is a big number, 10 is small, 30 and 63 are medium. \n\nLet me think about combining 88 and 10 first. 88 * 10 is 880, which is way too big. But if I subtract something from that, maybe? 88*10=880. Then 880 - (30 +63)= 880 -93= 787, which is not 450. Not helpful. Alternatively, 88 +10=98.

Maybe divide 63 by something. 63 divided by 10 is 6.3. Not helpful. 63 divided by 30 is 2.1. Hmm. Maybe 88 divided by something. 88 divided by 10 is 8.8. Not helpful. \n\nLet me try combining 30 and 63. 30+63=93. 93*10=930. 930-88=842. No. Or 30*63=1890. That's way too big. Maybe 1890 divided by something. 1890/88 is approximately 21.47.

Then 630 - (88 +30)=630-118=512. Not enough. Or 630 - (88*2)=630-176=454. Still not 450. But where would I get the 2? Since I can only use numbers once.\n\nAlternatively, 88* (something) =450. 450 divided by 88 is approximately 5.11. So maybe if I can get 5.11 from 10,30,63. Hmm, 30/ (63 -10)=30/53≈0.566.

Then, I need to subtract 30 to get to 104. But I have 12 and 47 left. How can 12 and 47 make 30? 47 - 12 = 35. That's 35. 134 - 35 is 99, which is not 104. Hmm.

Maybe subtract that from 94? 94 - 0.3 would be 93.7, not helpful. Wait, but maybe there's another approach.\n\nWhat if I combine 40 and 12 first? 40 + 12 = 52. Then 52 multiplied by something? Let's see, 52 * 2 is 104. But how to get 2 from 94 and 47? 94 - 47 = 47. Hmm, that's 47. 47 divided by something... 47/47 is 1, but we already used 47. Wait, maybe 94 divided by 47 is 2.

Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, 56 - 28 = 28. Then 45 - 36=9. 28 -9=19. Still not. What if I do (45 - 36) * (56 / 28). That would be 9 * 2 = 18. Close but not 27. Wait, 18 is half of 36. Hmm, but 36 is already used.\n\nWait, maybe I can use division with 45 and 36. 45/36=1.25. Then multiply by something. 1.25 * 28=35. Then 35 - 56= -21. Not helpful. Maybe 56 - (45/36)*28. Let's calculate that. 45/36=1.25. 1.25*28=35. 56-35=21. Still not.\n\nAnother approach: 36 divided by something. 36/(56-45)=36/11≈3.27. Then 3.27 *28≈91.56. No. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe combine subtraction and division. For example, 56 - 45 =11, then 36 - 28=8. 11 +8=19. Not 27. Alternatively, 56/(45-36)=56/9≈6.222. 6.222 * 28≈174.222. No. \n\nWhat if I do 45 - (56/ (36-28))? Let's see: 36-28=8. 56/8=7. Then 45-7=38. Not 27. Alternatively, 45 - (56/(36/28)). Let's compute 36/28=1.2857. 56 divided by that is 56 / (36/28) = 56*(28/36)= (56*28)/36≈ (1568)/36≈43.555. Then 45 -43.555≈1.444. Not helpful.\n\nHmm. Maybe using multiplication and subtraction. Let's think: 36 * (something) - another number. For example, 36*(45-56/28). Let's see: 56/28=2, 45-2=43. 36*43=1548. That's way too big. Not useful.\n\nAlternatively, 45 - 28=17. Then 56 -36=20. 17 +20=37. No. Not 27.\n\nWait, perhaps using fractions. Let's see: (45 * 28) / (56). That's 1260 /56=22.5. Then 22.5 +36=58.5. No. Or 22.5 -36= -13.5. Not helpful. \n\nWait, 45 divided by something. 45/(56/28) =45/2=22.5. Then 36 -22.5=13.5. Still not 27. \n\nAlternatively, 56/(28) =2. Then 45-2=43. 43-36=7. No.\n\nHmm. Maybe use all four numbers in a more complex equation. Let's try parentheses.\n\nHow about ((56 - 45) * 36) / 28. Let's compute: 56-45=11. 11*36=396. 396/28≈14.142. Not 27.\n\nAlternatively, (45 - (56/28)) * (36/36)? Wait, but 36/36 is 1, and that would use 36 twice. Not allowed.\n\nWait, perhaps (36 + 45) - (56 - 28). Let's see: 36+45=81. 56-28=28. 81-28=53. Nope.\n\nWait another approach: 28 + (45 - 36) =28 +9=37. Then 56 -37=19. No.\n\nWait, 45 - (36/ (56/28)). Let's compute: 56/28=2. 36/2=18. 45-18=27. Oh! Wait, that uses 56,28 as 56/28=2, then 36 divided by that 2 to get 18, then 45-18=27. Let me check if all numbers are used: 45, 36, 56, 28. Yes, each once. So the equation is 45 - (36 / (56 / 28)) =27. Let's verify:\n\n56 divided by 28 is 2. Then 36 divided by 2 is 18. 45 minus 18 is 27. Yes! That works.\n</think>\n\n<answer>45 - (36 / (56 / 28)) = 27</answer>"}]}

Let me try different operations.\n\nLet's see, 14 is a big number. If I subtract something from 14, maybe. Like 14 - 7 = 7, but then I have 2 and 5 left. Not sure. Or 14 divided by something. 14 / 7 is 2. Then 2 and 5 left. Maybe 2 + 5 =7. Not helpful. Wait, 14 /7 is 2, then 2 plus 5 is 7, but that's not 5. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, 5 is the target, so maybe use 5 as a result of some operation. For example, 5 multiplied by something, but I need to use all numbers. Let's see.\n\nWhat if I take 14 divided by 2, that's 7. Then 7 minus 7 is 0, but I already used 7 once. Oh, wait, each number can be used only once. So that's a problem. So 14/2 uses 14 and 2, gives 7. Then I have 7 left and 5. But original 7 is already used? Wait, no. Wait, the numbers given are 2,7,14,5. So if I use 14 and 2 in 14/2, then I have 7 and 5 left. So then maybe 7 - 5 =2. But that doesn't add up. Wait, how would that combine? Let's see:\n\n14 divided by 2 is 7, then subtract (7 -5)=2? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe (14/2) - (7 -5) = 7 -2 =5. Oh! That might work. Let's check:\n\n(14 / 2) - (7 - 5) = 7 - 2 = 5. Yes! But wait, have I used all numbers? Let's check:\n\n14, 2 in the division.

Wait, no, the equation is (14 / 2) minus (7 -5). The (7 -5) part is 2, so 7 minus 2 is 5. That works. So the equation is (14 / 2) - (7 -5) =5. But let me write that properly with the numbers. So 14, 2, 7, 5 all used once. Yes. So the equation is (14 / 2) - (7 -5) =5. Let me check again:\n\n14 divided by 2 is 7. Then subtract (7-5) which is 2. 7 minus 2 is 5. Correct.

Let's see the numbers given: 465 is a big one, 53 is also a prime, 11 is another prime, and 3. \n\nFirst, maybe subtract two numbers to get close. 465 is the largest. If I subtract something from 465 to get near 113. 465 minus what? Let's try 465 - 53 = 412. That's way too big. How about 465 divided by something? 465 divided by 3 is 155. Hmm, 155 minus something? If I use 53 and 11, maybe 155 - 53 - 11 = 91. Not enough. Or 155 - (53 + 11) = 155 - 64 = 91. Still not 113.\n\nWait, maybe multiply some numbers. 11 times 3 is 33. Then 53 + 33 is 86. Still not. 465 divided by 5 is 93, but I don't have a 5. Wait, maybe 465 divided by (11 - 3) = 465 / 8 = 58.125. Not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, 53 times 3 is 159. 159 - 46 = 113, but I don't have 46. But 465 minus 352 is 113. Wait, 352 is 11*32, but 32 isn't available. Maybe 53* (something). Let's think differently.\n\nWhat if I do 53 * 11 = 583. Then 583 - 465 = 118. Close to 113, but 5 more. But we have a 3 left. 118 - 3 = 115. Not quite. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, 53 + 11 = 64. 465 divided by something. If 465 / 64 is about 7.26, not helpful. Maybe 465 divided by 3 is 155. Then 155 - (53 - 11) = 155 - 42 = 113. Wait, let's check that: 155 - (53 - 11) = 155 - 42 = 113. Oh! That might work. Let me verify the numbers used: 465 divided by 3 is 155. Then subtract (53 -11), which is 42. So 155 -42=113. So the equation would be 465 /3 - (53 -11) =113. Let's check the operations and numbers used:\n\n465 is divided by 3, so that uses 465 and 3. Then 53 minus 11 uses both of them.

I need to create an equation using the numbers 90, 42, 12, and 93, each exactly once, with basic operations, and the result should be 501. Hmm. First, let me recall the target is 501. Let me jot down the numbers I have: 90, 42, 12, 93. All four must be used. \n\nLet me think about the possible operations. Maybe start by trying to get close to 501. Let's see, 93 is the largest number here. If I could multiply 93 by something to get close. For example, 93*5=465, which is still below 501. 93*5=465, then 501-465=36. Hmm. Is there a way to get 36 from the remaining numbers? But the remaining numbers would be 90, 42, 12. Wait, but maybe not. Wait, if I use 93*5, but how do I get 5 from the other numbers? Let me check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe subtract some numbers. Let's see, 93*5=465. Then 465 + 36 = 501. 36 can be 90 - 42 -12? 90 - 42 is 48, 48 -12 is 36. So that works. But wait, how do I get the 5 for the multiplication? Because that approach would require 93*5 + (90 -42 -12) = 501. But where does the 5 come from? Because all the numbers must be used. Let me see: the numbers are 93, 90, 42, 12. So if I use 93*5, then I need to create 5 from the remaining numbers. But the remaining numbers are 90,42,12. How can I make 5 from those? Let's see. 90 divided by (42 - 12) = 90 /30=3. Not 5. 42 - (90/12) = 42 -7.5=34.5. Not helpful. Hmm. Maybe this approach isn't working.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use addition first. 93 + 90 = 183. Then 42*12=504. 504 - (93 +90) = 504 -183=321. Not 501. Alternatively, 42*12=504. Close to 501. Then 504 - something. What's 504-3=501. But how do I get 3 from 93 and 90? 93 -90=3. So maybe 42*12 - (93-90) = 504 -3=501. Let me check: 42*12 is 504, 93-90 is 3, 504-3=501. But wait, the numbers used here are 42,12,93,90. Yes! All four numbers. Let me confirm:\n\n42 * 12 = 504\n\n93 -90 =3\n\n504 -3=501.\n\nSo combining that: (42 * 12) - (93 - 90) = 504 -3=501. Let me check if all numbers are used once: 42, 12, 93, 90. Yes, all are used.

I need to use all the numbers 53, 81, 54, and 453 to create an equation that equals 265. Each number can only be used once, and I can use basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, maybe I should look at the numbers and see which ones could combine in a way to get close to 265. The largest number here is 453, so maybe I can use that as a base and subtract or add something. Let's try subtracting. If I take 453 minus something, maybe the result is 265. Let's calculate what that \"something\" would be: 453 - 265 = 188. So I need to make 188 using the remaining numbers 53, 81, and 54. Hmm, can I combine 53, 81, and 54 to get 188?\n\nLet me try adding them up: 53 + 81 = 134, then 134 + 54 = 188. Oh, wait! That adds up exactly. So 53 + 81 + 54 = 188. Then 453 - (53 + 81 + 54) would be 453 - 188 = 265. But wait, the problem says I have to use each number once and all of them. In this case, I have used all numbers: 53, 81, 54, and 453. So that works. Let me check again:\n\n453 - 53 - 81 - 54. Let's compute step by step. 453 - 53 is 400. Then 400 - 81 is 319. Then 319 -54 is 265. Yes, that works. So the equation would be 453 - 53 - 81 - 54 = 265. But wait, do I need to use parentheses? Since subtraction is left associative, but maybe the order is correct as written. Let me verify.\n\nAlternatively, maybe write it as 453 - (53 + 81 + 54). That would also compute to 265. Both ways are correct. But the problem allows using operations multiple times, so either way should be acceptable. Let me check if there are any other possible combinations, but this seems straightforward. Let me just confirm that all numbers are used once: 453, 53, 81, 54—yes, all four numbers are used. Each is used once. The operations are subtraction and addition, which are allowed. So this should be the correct equation. Let me see if there's another way, but this seems the most direct. For example, another approach might involve multiplication or division, but considering the target is 265, which is less than 453, starting with subtraction makes sense. Let me check if using division or multiplication could work, but perhaps that's more complicated. For instance, maybe 453 divided by something. Let's see, 453 / 1.71 is approximately 265. But 1.71 isn't directly achievable with the given numbers. Alternatively, 453 - (81 - 54) * something. Let's see: 81 -54 is 27. 27 * 10 is 270. 453 -270 is 183, which is not 265. Hmm. Alternatively, 453 - (53 * something). 53 * 5 is 265. But 453 - 265 is 188, which again brings me back to needing 188. So that's the same as before. So maybe the first solution is the correct one. I think that works. Let me just write it down properly.\n</think>\n\n<answer>453 - 53 - 81 - 54 = 265</answer>"}]}

If I subtract 464 from 466, that gives me 2. But wait, 2 is one of the numbers I have to use. So maybe I can do something like 464 + 2 = 466. But then I still have 78 and 40 left, which I need to use. Oh, but I have to use all the numbers. So that approach might not work directly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can combine the other numbers to get 2 and then add to 464. Let's see. For example, 78 - 40 = 38. That's way more than 2. Not helpful. What if I divide them? 78 / 40 is 1.95, which is close to 2, but not exactly. If I could get 2 from 78 and 40, then adding that to 464 would give 466. But 78 divided by 40 is 1.95, which isn't 2. Maybe subtract: 40 - 78 is negative. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I can use multiplication. Let's see. 40 times 2 is 80. If I subtract that from 78, that's 78 - 80 = -2. Then add that to 464: 464 + (-2) = 462. Not 466. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 78 + 40 = 118. Then 118 times 2 is 236. Adding that to 464 would be way over. 464 + 236 = 700. Not good.\n\nLet's try another angle. The target is 466. So 464 is part of it. Let's see, 466 is 464 + 2. So maybe if I can get 464 + 2 from those numbers. But I also need to use 78 and 40. How?\n\nWait, perhaps 78 - 40 = 38. Then 464 - 38 = 426. Not helpful. Or 464 + 38 = 502. Still not 466.\n\nWhat if I use 78 and 40 to create 2? For example, 78 - (40 * 2) = 78 - 80 = -2. Then 464 + (-2) = 462. Not right. Alternatively, (40 - 78) / 2 = -19. Then 464 -19 = 445. No.\n\nAlternatively, 78 / (40 - 2) = 78 /38 ≈ 2.05. Close to 2. If I multiply that by 2, maybe. Hmm, but not exact.\n\nWait, maybe combine operations. Let's see: 464 is a big number. If I can subtract something from it and add something else. Let's see: 464 - (78 - 40) + 2. Let's compute that. 78 -40=38. 464-38=426. 426+2=428. Not 466.\n\nAlternatively, 464 + (78 - 40) - 2. 78-40=38. 464+38=502. 502-2=500. No. Not helpful.\n\nWhat if I use division? For example, 464 divided by 2 is 232. Then maybe 232 + 78 +40 = 350. No. Not 466.\n\nWait, 464 + 2 = 466. So if I can use 78 and 40 in a way that cancels out or something. Like, maybe (464 + 2) + (78 - 78) + (40 -40), but that's using numbers multiple times. Not allowed.\n\nAlternatively, how about 464 + (78 / (40 / 2))? Let's check: 40 /2 =20. Then 78 /20=3.9. 464 +3.9=467.9. Close but not exact.\n\nHmm. Maybe using subtraction and division. Let's try 464 + (78 - (40 / 2)). 40/2=20. 78-20=58. 464+58=522. No. Not 466.\n\nWait, maybe 464 - (78 / (40 /2)). 40/2=20, 78/20=3.9. 464-3.9=460.1. Not helpful.\n\nAnother approach: Let's think of 466 as 464 + 2. So perhaps 464 + 2, but I have to use 78 and 40. So maybe 78 -40 =38, and then 464 +2 -38 = 428. Not enough. Alternatively, 464 +2 + (78 -40) = 504. No.\n\nWait, maybe 78*2=156. Then 464 -156=308. Then 40 +308=348. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 78 * (40 -2). Let's compute: 40-2=38, 78*38=2964. That's way too big.\n\nHow about 40*2=80. Then 464 -80=384. Then 384 +78=462. Close to 466, but still 4 short. Hmm.\n\nWait, 464 + (78 - (40 / 2)) = 464 + (78-20)=464+58=522. No.\n\nWait, 464 + (40 - (78 /2 )). 78/2=39. 40-39=1. 464+1=465. Close.\n\nAlternatively, 464 + ( (40 - 78) /2 ). (40-78)/2= (-38)/2=-19. 464-19=445. No.\n\nHmm. Maybe 78 +40=118. 118 *2=236. 464-236=228. Not helpful.\n\nWait, 464 + 2 =466. So if I can use 78 and 40 to create 0, but I have to use them. But you can't create zero without using both, but that might not be possible. For example, 78 -78=0 but can't reuse numbers. Alternatively, 40 - (78/ something). But how?\n\nAlternatively, 78 - (40 * 2) =78-80=-2. Then 464 + (-2)=462. Not 466.\n\nWait, but maybe using subtraction in another way. Let's see: 464 + 78 =542. Then 542 -40=502. Then 502 - (2* something). But I already used 2. Or 502 /2=251. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 78 * (40 +2) =78*42=3276. Then 3276 /464≈7.06. Not helpful.\n\nHmm. Maybe trying different combinations. Let's list the numbers: 78,40,464,2. Need all four. Let's think of possible operations. Maybe (464 - 78) + (40 *2). Let's compute: 464-78=386. 40*2=80. 386+80=466. Wait, that's exactly 466! Let me check: 464 minus 78 is 386. Then 40 times 2 is 80. 386 plus 80 is 466. Yes! And all numbers are used once. So the equation would be (464 -78) + (40 *2) =466. Let me verify:\n\n464 -78=386\n\n40 *2=80\n\n386 +80=466. Perfect. And all numbers used exactly once. So that's the equation.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(464 - 78) + (40 * 2) = 466</answer>"}]}

I need to use all four numbers: 17, 58, 31, and 11, each exactly once, along with basic arithmetic operations to reach 95. Hmm. Let me start by thinking about the target number, 95. It's a bit less than 100, so maybe I can find a way to get close to 100 and then subtract something.\n\nLooking at the numbers, 58 and 31 are both relatively large. If I add them together, 58 + 31 is 89. Then I have 17 and 11 left. 89 plus 17 is 106, and then subtract 11 would be 95. Wait, let me check that again. 58 + 31 = 89, then 89 +17 = 106, 106 -11 = 95. That works! But wait, I need to make sure that each number is used once. So yes, 58, 31, 17, and 11 are all used. The operations would be addition and subtraction. Let me write that down: 58 +31 +17 -11. Let's compute that step by step. 58+31 is 89. 89+17 is 106. 106-11 is 95. Yep, that's correct. But wait, maybe there's another way too. Let me verify if that's the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe multiply some numbers. For instance, 17 and 11 could be multiplied. 17*11 is 187. Then what's left is 58 and 31. 187 -58 =129, then 129 -31=98. That's too high. Not helpful. Or 187 - (58+31) =187-89=98. Still not 95. Hmm.\n\nWhat if I try division? Let's see. 58 divided by something. 58/11 is approximately 5.27. Then maybe 17*5.27 plus 31. Not sure. That might not be an integer. Probably not the way to go.\n\nAnother approach: 31*3 =93, but how to get 3? Maybe 17-11=6, then 6/2=3. Wait, but I don't have a 2 here. Alternatively, maybe 17 - (11) =6, then 58 divided by 6? That's about 9.666. Not helpful.\n\nWait, let's go back to the first idea. The straightforward way seems to work. 58+31=89, plus17=106, minus11=95. So the equation is 58 + 31 +17 -11. Let me check again: all numbers used once. Yes. Operations: three additions and a subtraction. Wait, but how many operations? Each number is used once, and the operations are between them. So it would be ((58 +31) +17) -11. That's valid. Let me compute step by step:\n\n58 +31 =89\n\n89 +17=106\n\n106 -11=95\n\nYes, that's correct. So the equation is (58 +31 +17) -11. But since addition is associative, parentheses might not be necessary except for clarity. Alternatively, maybe written as 58 +31 +17 -11. That should be acceptable.\n\nIs there another possible combination? Let me check another approach. What if I subtract first. For example, 58 -17 =41. Then 41 * something. 41*2=82, but not sure. 31+11=42. 82 +42=124. Not helpful.\n\nOr maybe 58 - (17 -11) =58 -6=52. Then 52 +31=83. Still not 95.\n\nAnother idea: multiply 31 and 3. Let's see, 31*3=93. Then 93 + (58-17-11)=93 +30=123. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe 58* (something). 58*1.6379 ≈95, but that's not helpful with the numbers we have.\n\nAlternatively, 11*8.636 ≈95. Not helpful.\n\nHmm. Let's think again. The first solution seems to work. Let me verify once more:\n\n58 +31 =89\n\n89 +17=106\n\n106 -11=95\n\nYes. So the equation would be 58 +31 +17 -11 =95. All numbers used once. That's the solution. I don't think there's any mistake here. Let me just check if the order of operations matters. Since addition and subtraction are left-associative, it's correct as written. So the answer is 58 +31 +17 -11 =95.\n</think>\n\n<answer>58 + 31 + 17 - 11 = 95</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using the numbers 1, 42, 68, and 16, each exactly once, with basic arithmetic operations to reach 740. Hmm. Let's start by thinking about the target number. 740 is a pretty large number, so maybe multiplication is involved here.\n\nFirst, check the largest numbers: 68 and 42. If I multiply them, 68*42. Let me calculate that: 60*40=2400, 60*2=120, 8*40=320, 8*2=16. So 2400+120+320+16=2856. That's way too big. So maybe that's not the way. Wait, maybe adding some numbers first?\n\nAlternatively, combining 68 and 16. 68 +16=84. Then what's left is 1 and 42. 84 * something... 84*9=756, which is close to 740. But how to get 9 from 1 and 42? 42/ (something). Wait, 42 divided by something... 42 divided by (16- something). Wait, but 1 is left. Hmm, maybe 42 -1=41. But 84*41=3444, which is way over.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 68 * 16. Let's compute that: 68*10=680, 68*6=408, so 680+408=1088. Then subtract something. 1088 - (42 +1) = 1088 -43=1045. Still way over.\n\nAnother approach: 42*16=672. Then 672 +68=740. Wait, that's 672+68=740. But then where does 1 come in? Because we need to use all numbers. So, maybe 42*16 +68 +1. But that would be 672+68=740, then +1=741. That's over. Alternatively, maybe 42*16 +68 -1 = 672+68=740, minus 1 is 739. Not quite. Hmm.\n\nWait, but if 42*16=672, and then add 68, that's exactly 740. But then the 1 hasn't been used. So how can we include 1? Maybe multiply by 1 somewhere. Like (42*16 +68)*1. But that would still be 740, but I'm not sure if that's allowed. Wait, but using 1 as *1 is allowed. So the equation would be (42×16 +68)×1. But does that count as using all numbers? Since 1 is being multiplied, but multiplication by 1 is trivial. The problem says each number must be used once, and all numbers must be used. So maybe that's acceptable. Let me check: 42*16=672, 672+68=740, then multiplied by 1 gives 740. So equation is (42×16 +68) ×1 = 740. That uses all four numbers. But does the order of operations matter here? Let me verify: 42×16=672, 672+68=740, 740×1=740. Yes. So that works. But the problem allows using operations multiple times, but each number once. So that seems valid. However, maybe the user expects the 1 to be used in a non-trivial way. Let me check again. The user says \"each number can only be used once, and you must use all the numbers.\" So using 1 as a multiplier is acceptable. So (42*16 +68)*1 = 740. But maybe parentheses can be arranged differently. Alternatively, 42*16 +68 +1 -1? No, that would use 1 twice. Not allowed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe subtract 1 somewhere. Let's see. 68*(16-1) = 68*15=1020. Then 1020 - 42 = 978. Not close. Hmm. Or 42*(16 + something). Let's try 42*(16 + 68/1). Wait, 68/1 is 68. So 42*(16+68) = 42*84=3528. Way over.\n\nAlternatively, 68*(42 -16 +1). Let's compute that: 42-16=26, 26+1=27. 68*27= 68*20 +68*7=1360 +476=1836. No.\n\nWait, another angle: 740 divided by 1 is 740, so maybe that's a way to include the 1. Let's see if we can make 740 without the 1, then multiply by 1. But we need to use all numbers, so maybe that's the way.\n\nWait, earlier idea: 42*16=672, 672 +68=740. So 42*16 +68=740. But that leaves out the 1. So if we can incorporate the 1 in a way that doesn't change the result. For example, adding 1-1. But that would require using 1 twice, which we can't. Alternatively, multiply by 1. So (42*16 +68)*1=740. So that uses all numbers. But maybe the user expects that the 1 must be used in a necessary operation. But according to the problem statement, you can use the numbers once each, and operations as needed. So multiplying by 1 is allowed. Therefore, that equation would work.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using subtraction or division. Let's see. Let me try other combinations.\n\nWhat if we do 68* (16 - (42/ something)). Let's see. 42 divided by 1 is 42. 16 -42 = -26. 68*(-26)= -1768. Not helpful. Alternatively, 68*(42 -16) /1. 42-16=26. 68*26=1768. 1768 /1=1768. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 68 +42=110. Then 110* (16 -1). 110*15=1650. Still too big.\n\nHmm. What if we do 68*16=1088. Then 1088 - (42* something). Let's see. 42*8=336. 1088-336=752. Close to 740. 752 -12=740. But how to get 12 from the remaining numbers? The remaining numbers would be 1 and something else. Wait, but in this scenario, we've already used 68 and 16 and 42. The remaining number would be 1. So maybe 1088 - (42*8 + something). But this is getting complicated. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 68* (something) - something else. Let's see. Let's try 42*16=672. Then 740 -672=68. So 672 +68=740. But that uses 42,16,68. Then the 1 is left. So again, we can do 672 +68 +1 -1=740, but that uses 1 twice. Not allowed. Alternatively, 672 +68 + (1-1). Also uses 1 twice. No.\n\nWait, but if we take (42*16) + (68*1) =672 +68=740. That would use all numbers: 42,16,68,1. Let me check: 42*16 is 672, 68*1 is 68. 672+68=740. Yes! So the equation is 42×16 +68×1 =740. So this uses all numbers once each. So that's valid. The operations are multiplication and addition. Each number is used once, and all are used. So this should work. Let me verify the calculation again: 42*16=672, 68*1=68. 672+68=740. Correct. So this equation fits the requirements. Therefore, the answer is (42×16) + (68×1) =740. But since we need to write it in one line with parentheses as needed, maybe (42 * 16) + (68 * 1) = 740. But the problem wants the equation in the answer tags. So we can write it as (42*16)+(68*1), which equals 740. That uses all numbers once, and all operations are allowed. Perfect.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(42*16)+(68*1)=740</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using the numbers 27, 19, 29, and 5 exactly once each, with basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /), to equal 22. Hmm. Let's start by thinking about possible combinations.\n\nFirst, maybe subtract some numbers to get down to 22. For example, 29 is the largest number here. If I subtract something from 29, like 29 - 5 = 24. Then maybe 24 - (27 - 19)? Wait, 27-19 is 8, so 24 -8 =16. Not 22. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, 27 + 19 = 46. That's too big. Maybe 46 - 29 =17, then 17 +5=22. But wait, that uses 27,19,29,5. Let me check: 27+19=46, 46-29=17, 17+5=22. But does that use all numbers once? Yes, each number is used once. So that would be (27 + 19 - 29) +5. Wait, but parentheses might be needed. Let's compute step by step:\n\nFirst part: 27 +19 =46. Then 46 -29=17. Then 17 +5=22. So the equation would be ((27 + 19) - 29) + 5 = 22. But maybe we can write it without the extra parentheses. Like 27 +19 -29 +5. Let me check that: 27+19=46, 46-29=17, 17+5=22. Yes, that works. So the equation would be 27 + 19 - 29 +5 =22. But wait, is that all the numbers used once? Yes. So maybe that's the answer. But let me verify.\n\nAlternatively, maybe another approach. Let's see if there's a way to use division or multiplication. For example, 5 is a number that could be used as a divisor. Let's think: 29 - (27 / something) =22. Let's see, 29 -7=22. So 27 divided by something equals 7. But 27 divided by 3.857 is 7, which isn't an integer. So maybe that's not the way. Or 27 -5=22, but then I have to use 19 and 29. But if I do 27 -5 =22, then I need to use 19 and 29 in a way that cancels them out. But since all numbers must be used, that's not possible. So that approach doesn't work.\n\nAnother idea: 19 + 5 =24. Then 24 - (29 -27) =24 -2=22. Let's check that. 29-27=2, then 19+5=24, 24-2=22. So that would be (19 +5) - (29 -27)=22. Let's see: 19+5=24, 29-27=2, 24-2=22. Yes. That uses all four numbers: 19,5,29,27. Each used once. So the equation would be (19 + 5) - (29 - 27) = 22. Let me check that again. 19+5 is 24. 29-27 is 2. 24-2 is 22. Perfect. That works. So this is another possible solution.\n\nSo there are at least two possible equations here. Let me see if the first one I thought of, 27+19-29+5, is valid. Let's compute step by step: 27+19=46, 46-29=17, 17+5=22. So yes, that's correct. But wait, is that allowed? Because when you write the equation without parentheses, the operations are performed left to right. So yes, addition and subtraction are left associative. So 27+19-29+5 is equivalent to ((27+19)-29)+5. Which equals 22. So both equations are correct.\n\nBut which one is simpler? The problem says to return the equation, so either one is acceptable. Let me check if there's any other possible way. Let's see. Maybe using multiplication. For example, 27 - (5) =22. Then use 19 and 29. Maybe 29 -19=10, but how to get 10 involved? Not sure. Alternatively, 29 -19=10, then 10 multiplied by something. But 27-5=22, but then 29 and 19 have to be used. So maybe (29 -19) * (something) but that seems tricky.\n\nAlternatively, 5 * something. Let's think. 5*4=20, then plus 2. But how. Not sure. Another way: (27 - (29 -19)) +5. Let's compute: 29-19=10, 27-10=17, 17+5=22. So that's the same as the second equation I found earlier. So (27 - (29 -19)) +5 =22. Which is equivalent to 27 -29 +19 +5 =22. Let me check: 27-29 is -2, plus19 is 17, plus5 is 22. Yes. So that's another way to write it. But this is the same as the first equation. Because 27 -29 +19 +5 is the same as 27+19 -29 +5. Just reordered the terms. Since addition and subtraction are left associative, the order doesn't matter as long as the sequence is correct.\n\nSo the possible equations are:\n\n1. 27 + 19 - 29 +5 =22\n\n2. (19 +5) - (29 -27) =22\n\nEither one is correct. Let's check if both use all numbers once. The first uses 27,19,29,5 each once. The second uses 19,5,29,27 each once. So both are valid.\n\nBut the problem might expect a certain way of writing. For example, the second one uses parentheses more neatly. Let's see if there's a requirement for minimal parentheses. The problem doesn't specify, so either is fine.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first one is acceptable as well. But let me check the problem statement again. It says \"create an equation that equals 22\" using each number once with basic operations. So both equations are valid. The user may accept either.\n\nBut I should present one. Which one is better? The second one uses subtraction of a grouped term, which might be considered more efficient. Let's go with that one. So the answer would be (19 + 5) - (29 - 27) =22. Let me verify once more:\n\n19 +5 is 24. 29 -27 is 2. 24 -2 is 22. Correct.\n\nYes, that works. So this equation uses all numbers once and achieves the target.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(19 + 5) - (29 - 27) = 22</answer>"}]}

Let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, let's recall that we can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Each number must be used once. The target is 76.\n\nLet me list out the numbers: 66, 75, 53, 32. Let's see the possible operations. Since 75 is the largest number, maybe I can use it as a starting point. If I subtract something from 75 to get close to 76, but 75 is already just 1 less than 76. Wait, but how can we get 76 from 75? Maybe 75 + (something) = 76. Then the something would have to be 1. So can we get 1 from the remaining numbers 66, 53, 32?\n\nHmm. Let's see. 66, 53, 32. To get 1, maybe 53 - (66 - 32) = 53 - 34 = 19. No. Or 66 - 53 - 32 = 66 - 85 = negative. Not helpful. Alternatively, division: 32 / (66 - 53) = 32 /13 ≈ 2.46. Not 1. What about 53 - 32 = 21. 66 - 21 = 45. Not 1. Alternatively, 66 - 53 =13, 32 -13=19. Still no. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 32 divided by (66 - 53) is 32/13 ≈ 2.46. If we subtract that from something else? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe 66 divided by something. 66 / 53 is about 1.245. Then subtract something from that. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, if we can get 1 from 66, 53, 32. Let's think: 53 - 32 =21. Then 21 - (66 / something). Wait, 66 divided by 66 is 1. But we can't use 66 again. Alternatively, 66 - 53 =13, 32 -13=19. Still not 1.\n\nMaybe the approach of 75 +1 is not the best. Let me think of another way.\n\nWhat if we use 66 as the base. 66 + something =76. Then the something is 10. Can we get 10 from 75,53,32?\n\nLooking at 75,53,32. Let's see: 75 -53 =22. 22 -32= -10. So 75 -53 -32 = -10. Then 66 + (-10) =56. Not 76. Alternatively, 53 -32=21. 75 -21=54. 66 +54=120. No.\n\nAlternatively, multiply or divide. Maybe 75 / something. For example, 75 - (53 -32) =75 -21=54. Then 66 +54=120. Not helpful. Wait, 53 -32 is 21. Then 75 -21=54. Then 66 -54=12. Not 76.\n\nAnother approach: 32 is the smallest number. Maybe use it to subtract from another. Let's see: 53 -32=21. Then 75 -21=54. 66 +54=120. No. Or 66 - (75 - (53 -32))=66 - (75 -21)=66 -54=12. Not 76.\n\nHmm. Maybe multiplication. For example, 75 - 66 =9. Then 53 -32=21. 9 *21=189. Not helpful. Alternatively, 75 * something. 75 * (53 -32) =75*21=1575. Not near 76.\n\nAlternatively, division. Let's think: 75 divided by something. 75 divided by 32 is about 2.34. Then 66 -53=13. 2.34 *13≈30.42. Not 76.\n\nWait, maybe combine operations. Let's try 66 - (75 / (53 -32)). Let's compute 53 -32=21. Then 75/21≈3.571. Then 66 -3.571≈62.429. Not 76.\n\nAlternatively, 75 - (66 / (53 -32)). 53-32=21. 66/21≈3.142. Then 75 -3.142≈71.857. Close but not 76.\n\nHmm. Maybe a different grouping. Let's consider 75 + 53=128. Then 128 -66=62. 62 +32=94. Not 76. Or 128 -32=96. 96 -66=30. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 66 +32=98. 98 -53=45. 45 +75=120. No. Not 76.\n\nWait, 75 -53=22. 66 -32=34. Then 22 +34=56. Not 76.\n\nHmm. What about combining operations with division and multiplication. For example: (75 - 66) * (53 -32). Let's compute that: 9 *21=189. No. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 75 * (53 - (66 -32)). Let's compute 66-32=34. 53-34=19. Then 75*19=1425. Not 76.\n\nAnother angle: 53*32=1696. That's way too big. Maybe divide. 53/32≈1.656. Then 1.656* something... Maybe 66 +75=141. 141 +1.656≈142.656. Not 76.\n\nAlternatively, 66*32=2112. 2112 divided by 53 is about 39.85. 75 -39.85≈35.15. Not 76.\n\nHmm. Let's think again. The target is 76, which is 75 +1. But getting 1 from 66,53,32. Alternatively, 76 is 66 +10. How to get 10 from 75,53,32. Let's see: 53 - (75 -32)=53 -43=10. Yes! So 53 - (75 -32)=10. Then 66 +10=76. Let me check:\n\nFirst, 75 -32=43. Then 53 -43=10. Then 66 +10=76. So the equation would be 66 + (53 - (75 -32)) =76. Let's verify:\n\n75-32=43. 53-43=10. 66+10=76. Yes! That works. So the equation is 66 + (53 - (75 - 32)) =76.\n\nLet me make sure all numbers are used once: 66,53,75,32. Yes, all four numbers are used exactly once. The operations are subtraction inside the parentheses, another subtraction, and addition. So that's valid.\n</think>\n\n<answer>66 + (53 - (75 - 32)) = 76</answer>"}]}

Let's start by thinking about the target number, 870. What's 870 divisible by? Let's check. 870 divided by 54 is... 870 /54 ≈16.11, which isn't an integer. Hmm. Maybe 58? 870 /58 is 15. So that's interesting. Wait, 58 times 15 is 870. Oh, wait, 58*15=870. But I have to use all the numbers. So if I can get 58*15 from the numbers, but then there are two 54s left. Wait, but the problem states that each number can be used only once, and all must be used. So I have to use both 54s as well. Hmm, that complicates things.\n\nSo maybe I need to combine the 54s in some way. Let's think. Let me see. If I can use the two 54s together. For example, 54 +54=108. Then maybe 108 multiplied by something. 108 * 8 = 864, which is close to 870. But how to get 8 from the remaining numbers 58 and 15. Wait, 58 - 15=43. That's not helpful. Alternatively, 15 - (58-54) but that uses 54 again. Wait, no, each number can only be used once. So I can't do that. Alternatively, maybe 15 - (something). Let's think differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe subtract or divide the numbers. Let's see. If I have 54 * 58 = 3132. That's way too big. Then maybe subtract something. 3132 - (54 * something). Let's see 3132 - (54*42)= 3132 - 2268=864. Close to 870 but still not. Hmm. Alternatively, 54*58=3132. Then divide by something. 3132 divided by 15 is 208.8, which is not helpful.\n\nWait, what if I do (54 * 15) = 810. Then 810 + 58 = 868, which is close but still 2 short. And there's a 54 left. Hmm. So 810 +58 +54= 922, which is way over. Alternatively, 54*15=810, then 810 + (58 -54)= 810 +4=814. Not helpful.\n\nAnother approach: 870 is 58*15. So if I can use 58 and 15 to make 870, but then how to incorporate the two 54s. Maybe use subtraction or division. Like 58*15 + 54 -54=870. But that's using 54 -54=0, which adds nothing. But that seems like a possible way, but maybe against the rules? The problem states that each number can only be used once. So using both 54s in a subtraction would be allowed as long as each is used once. Wait, but then the equation would be 58*15 +54-54=870. But that's effectively 58*15 +0=870. But is that acceptable? The problem says to use all numbers. So if I use each number once, even if they cancel each other out, maybe that's allowed. Let me check. The problem says \"you must use all the numbers\". So if I do 58*15 +54-54, that uses all numbers once each. So that would work. But maybe the problem expects all numbers to contribute meaningfully. But according to the problem's instructions, as long as each number is used once, and all are used, then it's allowed. So maybe that's a possible answer. Let's check: 58*15=870. Then 54-54=0. So adding them: (58*15)+(54-54)=870+0=870. So equation is (58*15)+(54-54)=870. But is that acceptable? The problem says to use each number once, and all operations. So yes, each number is used once. But maybe the user expects a more \"meaningful\" combination. But according to the problem's constraints, this might be valid. However, perhaps the problem expects all numbers to be used in a way that they contribute to the result, not just cancel out. But the problem doesn't specify that. So if that's allowed, then that's an answer. But maybe the user wants a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, let's think if we can combine the numbers in a different way. Let's see. 54 and 58 can be multiplied: 54*58=3132. Then maybe divide by something. If we divide by 15, 3132/15=208.8. Not helpful. If we divide by 54/15=3.6, then 3132/(54/15)=3132*(15/54)=3132*(5/18)=870. Wait, that's a possibility. Let me calculate that. 54*58=3132. Then divide by (54/15). Wait, 54 divided by 15 is 3.6. Then 3132 divided by 3.6 is indeed 870. Because 3132 /3.6 = 870. Let me check: 3.6 times 870 is 3132. Yes. So that works. So the equation would be (54*58)/(54/15)=870. Let's break this down. The numbers used are 54,58,54,15. Each used once. Wait, but 54 is used twice here. Wait, no. Wait, in this equation, we have 54 multiplied by 58, then divided by (54 divided by 15). So the two 54s are in the numerator and denominator. So we're using each 54 once. The first 54 is in the multiplication with 58, and the second 54 is in the denominator with 15. So all numbers are used once. Because the two 54s are separate instances. Wait, but the original numbers given are 54,58,54,15. So there are two 54s. So each 54 is used once in the equation. So that's allowed. So the equation would be (54 * 58) / (54 / 15) = 870. Let's verify:\n\nFirst, compute the denominator: 54 /15 = 3.6\n\nThen the entire equation: (54 *58) /3.6 = 3132 /3.6 = 870. Correct.\n\nSo this equation uses all the numbers: 54,58,54,15. Each exactly once. So that's valid. So that's a valid equation. So this would be a correct answer. The equation is (54*58)/(54/15) =870.\n\nBut wait, let's check the order of operations. The way it's written is (54*58) divided by (54/15). So the division is between the product and the fraction. So yes, that's correct. Let's compute step by step:\n\n54 multiplied by 58: 54*58=3132.\n\nThen 54 divided by 15: 54/15=3.6.\n\nThen 3132 divided by 3.6: 3132 ÷3.6 = 870. Yes.\n\nSo this works. Therefore, the equation is (54×58)÷(54÷15)=870. So that's a valid solution.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(54 * 58) / (54 / 15) = 870</answer>"}]}

All numbers must be used once, and only basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division. Hmm. Let's start by listing out the numbers I have: two 10s, a 4, and a 28.\n\nFirst thought: 28 is a big number. Maybe I can divide it by something. If I divide 28 by 4, that gives me 7. Oh wait, that's exactly the target number. But then I still have the two 10s left, and I need to use all numbers. So that approach might not work directly. Let me write that down: 28 / 4 =7. But then I need to incorporate the 10s somehow. Maybe subtract or add them?\n\nAlternatively, maybe combine the two 10s first. For example, 10 - 10 =0. Then adding that to 28/4 would still be 7. But does that use all numbers? Yes: 10,10,28,4. So (28 / 4) + (10 -10) =7 +0=7. That seems to work. Wait, let's check: 28 divided by 4 is 7, and 10 minus 10 is 0. Adding them gives 7. So the equation would be (28 / 4) + (10 -10) =7. That uses all numbers once each. Let me verify the numbers used: 28,4,10,10. Yes, all used once. And the operations are division, subtraction, and addition. That should be acceptable. \n\nAlternatively, maybe another way? Let's think if there's another combination. For example, 28 minus something. If I take 28 - (10 +10 +4)=28-24=4. Not 7. How about 28 - (10 * something). If I do 28 - (10 * (10 /4)) that's 28 - (10*2.5)=28-25=3. Not helpful. \n\nWhat if I multiply 10 and 4? 10*4=40. Then 40 - 28=12. Then 12 - the other 10=2. Not 7. Hmm. \n\nAnother approach: Let's see. The target is 7. 7 can be made in different ways. For example, 14 divided by 2, 21 divided by 3, 28 divided by 4, etc. Wait, we have 28 and 4. So 28/4 is 7. Then we need to use the two 10s. So how can we combine them in such a way that they cancel out? Like 10-10=0. Then adding that to 7 gives 7. That's the previous idea. \n\nAlternatively, maybe 10/10=1. Then 4+1=5, and 28-5=23. Not 7. Not helpful. \n\nWhat if we do (28 -10) / (10 -4)? Let's calculate that: 18 /6=3. Nope. \n\nWait, another idea: 28 divided by (10 - (10/4)). Let's see: 10 divided by 4 is 2.5. 10 -2.5=7.5. Then 28 divided by 7.5 is approximately 3.73. Not 7. \n\nHmm. Maybe using multiplication. For instance, 10 * 4 =40. Then 40 -28=12. Then 12 -10=2. No. Not helpful. \n\nWait, maybe we can use the two 10s to make 20. Then 28 -20=8. Then 8 -4=4. No. \n\nAlternatively, 10 +10=20. 28 -20=8. 8 -4=4. Still not 7. \n\nHow about combining 10 and 4 first? 10 +4=14. Then 28 -14=14. Then 14 -10=4. Nope. \n\nAnother angle: Let's think of 7 as 28 divided by 4. So if we can express 7 as 28/4, then the remaining numbers are 10 and 10. How to use them in a way that doesn't affect the result. Since they must be used, perhaps 10 -10 =0, and then 0 added to 28/4 gives 7. That's the first idea. \n\nIs there any other way? Let's check. Suppose we do (28 -10) / (10 -4). Wait, 28-10=18, 10-4=6. 18/6=3. Not 7. \n\nWhat if we arrange the numbers as (10 +10 +4) =24, then 28 -24=4. Not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, (10 * 4) -28 =12, then 12 -10=2. Not 7. \n\nHmm. Let me try to see if there's a different combination. Let's see, maybe:\n\n(28 / (10 - (10/4))) ? Let's compute denominator: 10 - (10/4)=10-2.5=7.5. 28 /7.5=3.733… Not 7. \n\nAnother idea: 10 divided by (10 - (28/4)). Compute 28/4=7. 10-7=3. Then 10/3≈3.333. No. \n\nWait, maybe 28 - (10 + (10/4))? Let's compute that: 10/4=2.5. 10+2.5=12.5. 28-12.5=15.5. Not 7. \n\nAlternatively, 10*(4 - (28/10)). Compute 28/10=2.8. 4-2.8=1.2. 10*1.2=12. Not 7. \n\nHmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's go back to the initial idea where 28 divided by 4 is 7, and then 10 minus 10 is 0. So combining those two gives 7. So the equation would be (28 / 4) + (10 - 10) =7. That uses all numbers once each. Let me check again: 28,4,10,10. All used. Operations: division, subtraction, addition. All allowed. And the result is 7. \n\nIs there any other possible equation? Like using multiplication and division? Let's think. Suppose we do (28 -10) + (4 -10). That's 18 -6=12. No. \n\nOr 28 - (10 +10 +4)=4. No. \n\nAnother approach: 10 +4=14. 28 divided by 14=2. Then 10 -2=8. Not 7. \n\nWait, maybe (28 - (10 +10)) divided by 4. So 28-20=8, 8/4=2. No. \n\nAlternatively, (10 +10) - (28 /4). 20 -7=13. Not 7. \n\nHmm. I'm not finding another way. The first approach seems to be the only one that works. Let me confirm once more:\n\n28 divided by 4 is 7. 10 minus 10 is 0. 7 plus 0 is 7. All numbers used: 28,4,10,10. Each exactly once. Operations used: division, subtraction, addition. All allowed. So the equation is (28 /4) + (10 -10) =7. That should be correct.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(28 / 4) + (10 - 10) = 7</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using the numbers 3, 60, 94, and 309, each exactly once, with basic operations, and the result should be 460. Hmm. Let's start by thinking about what operations might get me close.\n\nFirst, 309 is the largest number here. Maybe I can use that as a base. If I subtract something from 309, will that help? Let's see. 460 is 151 more than 309. So 309 + 151 = 460. But do I have numbers that can combine to make 151? The remaining numbers are 3, 60, 94. Let's see. 94 + 60 is 154, which is 3 more than 151. Hmm, maybe 94 + 60 - 3 = 151. Then 309 + 151 = 460. But how to structure that. So the equation would be 309 + (94 + 60 - 3) = 460. But wait, that uses all numbers: 309, 94, 60, 3. Yes. Let's check: 94 + 60 is 154, minus 3 is 151. 309 + 151 is 460. Perfect! So the equation is 309 + 94 + 60 - 3 = 460. But wait, does that use each number once? Let's check: 309 is used, 94, 60, 3. Yes. All used once. But the operations are addition and subtraction. So that works. Let me verify: 309 + 94 is 403. 403 + 60 is 463. 463 - 3 is 460. Yep, that adds up. So the equation would be 309 + 94 + 60 - 3 = 460. But do I need to use parentheses? Let me check if the order of operations matters here. Since addition and subtraction are left associative, it would be calculated as ((309 + 94) + 60) - 3), which is correct. So maybe parentheses aren't necessary. But let's write it in a way that's clear. Alternatively, maybe combining 94 and 3 first. Let's see another approach.\n\nWait, another idea: Could multiplication be involved? For example, 309 is a big number. What if we subtract or add something multiplied? Let's see. Suppose 309 * something. 309 * 1.5 is 463.5, which is close to 460 but not exact. Alternatively, 309 + (something). Let's see. Alternatively, 60 * 94. Wait, 60 * 94 is 5640, which is way too big. 94 * 3 is 282. 309 - 282 is 27. 60 + 27 is 87. Not helpful. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, 94 divided by something. 94 / 3 is roughly 31.333. 309 + 60 + 31.333 is about 400.333. Not enough. Maybe 94 * 3 = 282. Then 309 - 282 = 27. Then 60 + 27 = 87. Still not useful.\n\nWait, perhaps 309 + 60 = 369. Then 94 * 3 = 282. 369 + 282 = 651. Too big. Not helpful.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe 309 + 94 = 403. Then 403 + 60 = 463. 463 - 3 = 460. That's the same as before. So that seems to be the straightforward solution. So the equation is 309 + 94 + 60 - 3 = 460. Let me check that again. Yes, 309 plus 94 is 403, plus 60 is 463, minus 3 is 460. Perfect. And all numbers are used exactly once. That works. So I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\n<answer>309 + 60 + 94 - 3 = 460</answer>"}]}

Since the target is 1, maybe division or subtraction could help because those can reduce numbers significantly.\n\nFirst, maybe pair some numbers to get close to each other. Let's see. 90 is a big number, so dividing it by something might help. If I take 90 divided by 45, that gives 2. But I don't have a 45. Wait, but maybe 43 is close. What if I do 90 divided by (something). Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, 69 and 22. If I subtract 22 from 69, that's 47. Not sure how that helps. Or 69 minus 43 is 26. Still not helpful.

Wait, but 43 is close. Maybe 90 divided by (something involving 43 and another number). Let's see. If I do 43 - 22 = 21. Then 90 divided by 21 is roughly 4.285... Not helpful. Maybe 43 + 22 = 65, then 90 / 65 is about 1.384... Still not 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use subtraction to get to zero first. Like (something) - (something) = 1. But need to use all numbers. Let's try.\n\nSuppose I do 90 - 69 = 21. Then I have 21, 22, 43 left. Wait, but I need to use all numbers. So maybe 90 - 69 =21, then 43 -22=21. Then 21 -21=0. But that's 0, not 1. Hmm. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe use division. Let's think: if I can create a fraction where numerator and denominator are close. For example, 43 - 22 =21. Then 90 divided by (something). Let me see. If I have 69 and 21. 69 divided by 21 is 3.285... Not 1. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe 69 divided by (something) equals 1. That would require dividing by 69. But then I need to use the other numbers. Let's see. If I do 69 divided by 69, that's 1, but I don't have two 69s. But I have 22, 43, 90 left. Maybe create a 69 from those? 22 +43=65. Close but not 69. 90 -22=68. Not 69. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, think of multiplication. If I can get two numbers multiplied to equal another pair subtracted or added. For instance, 22 * 43 = 946. Then 946 - 90 = 856. Still way too big. Maybe 90 - (69 +43) = -22. Then, not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe fractions. Let's try combining 43 and 22 first. Let's say 43/22 ≈1.954. Then if I subtract something from that to get 1. So 1.954 - x =1. So x=0.954. Maybe 69/90 is 0.766... Hmm, not quite. Or 90/69≈1.304. Then 1.954 -1.304≈0.65. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (90 -69) / (43 -22). Let's compute that. 90-69=21, 43-22=21. So 21/21=1. Oh! Wait, that works. Let me check:\n\n(90 - 69) / (43 - 22) = 21 / 21 = 1. Yes! And all numbers are used once: 90, 69, 43, 22. Exactly each once.

Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, 127 is a prime number, so it's not easily factorable. That might mean subtraction or division isn't straightforward here. Let me look at the numbers given: 65 and 69 are both close to 70, which is 10 times 7. Maybe there's a way to combine 65 and 69 with 7 to get close to 127.\n\nLet's see. If I subtract 65 from 69, that gives me 4. Then maybe use 7 and 1 somehow. 7 times 4 is 28, which is way off. Hmm. Alternatively, 69 minus 65 is 4, then 7 times 4 is 28. Adding 1 would make 29. Not helpful.\n\nWhat if I try adding 65 and 69? That's 134. Then subtract 7? 134 - 7 = 127. Oh, wait! But then I have to use all four numbers. So 65 + 69 - 7 equals 127, but where does the 1 come in? Because I need to use all four numbers. So maybe I need to incorporate the 1 into the equation somehow.\n\nPerhaps there's a way to use division or multiplication with 1. Since multiplying by 1 doesn't change the value, maybe like 65 + 69 - (7 / 1) = 65 + 69 -7 = 127. But wait, that uses all four numbers: 65, 69, 7, 1. Let me check: 65 + 69 is 134, then subtract 7 (since 7 divided by 1 is 7), so 134 -7 = 127. That works! All numbers are used once. So the equation would be (65 + 69) - (7 / 1) = 127. But I can write it as 65 + 69 - 7 / 1. However, according to order of operations, division comes before subtraction, so it's 65 + 69 - (7/1) which is 134 -7 = 127. Yes, that's correct. \n\nWait, but maybe there's another way. Let me verify again. If I do 69 - (7 / 1) + 65, that's the same. So yes, that seems to work. Alternatively, using parentheses to make it clearer: (65 + 69) - (7 / 1) = 127. That uses all numbers once. So I think that's the solution. Let me check if there's any other possible combinations.\n\nAlternatively, what if I multiply 7 by something? For example, 7 * 18 is 126, which is close to 127. But I need to get 18 from 65, 69, and 1. That seems tricky. 65 - 69 would be negative, so maybe not. Or 69 - (65 / something). If I take 65 divided by something to make 65 smaller. 65 / 1 is 65. Then 69 - 65 =4. Then 7*4 + something? But that would require using numbers again. So perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, 7 * (1 + something) = 127. 127 /7 is approximately 18.14. So maybe 1 + 17.14. But where does 17.14 come from? Maybe 65 and 69. Let me see: 65 + 69 is 134. 134 divided by something? 134 / 7.5 is around 17.86. Not helpful. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 69 - (65 / (7 -1)). Let's compute that: 7-1 is 6. 65/6 is about 10.833. Then 69 -10.833 is around 58.167. That's not helpful. \n\nAnother approach: 127 is 128 -1. 128 is 2^7. Maybe can we make 128 using other numbers and then subtract 1. For example, (69 + 65) is 134. 134 -7 =127. But then we still need to use 1. Wait, that's the same as previous. So if we do (65 +69) -7 =127, but then where does 1 come in? Unless we can use 1 in a way that doesn't affect the result. For example, multiply by 1: (65 +69) -7 *1. That would use all numbers. Wait, but order of operations would require multiplication first. So 65 +69 =134, then 7*1=7, so 134 -7 =127. So that's 65 +69 -7*1. That uses all numbers. Let me check: numbers used are 65,69,7,1. Yes, all four. So the equation would be 65 + 69 -7 *1. Since multiplication comes before subtraction, this works. So the equation is 65 + 69 -7*1 =127. Alternatively, written with parentheses to clarify: (65 + 69) - (7 * 1) =127. That's a valid equation. Let me verify the arithmetic again. 65 +69 is 134. 7*1 is7. 134-7 is 127. Correct.\n\nI think that's the solution. Are there other possible ways? Let's see. For example, using division in another way. Suppose 69 + (65 -1)/7. Let's compute that: 65 -1 =64. 64 divided by7 is approximately 9.14. 69 +9.14 is around 78.14. Not 127. No. Alternatively, (69 +7) * something. 69+7=76. 76 *1=76. 76 +65=141. No. 76 * (1 + something). Not helpful. \n\nAnother idea: 65 * 1 =65. Then 69 +65=134. 134 -7=127. That would be 69 + (65*1) -7 =127. But that's the same as before. So 65*1 +69 -7. Which uses all numbers. That's another way to write it. But the equation would be 65*1 +69 -7 =127. Which is correct. But is that allowed? Because using multiplication here. Alternatively, but the original numbers are used once each. Yes. So this is another valid expression. So maybe the user can present either of these. But the key is to use all four numbers. Both expressions use all four numbers. So either (65 +69) -7*1, or 65*1 +69 -7. Both work. But perhaps the simplest is 65 +69 -7*1. \n\nI think that's the solution. Let me just check again. 65 and 69 add up to 134. Subtract 7*1 which is7. 134-7=127. Yes. So the equation would be 65 + 69 - 7 * 1 = 127. So written as (65 + 69) - (7 * 1) = 127. Or without parentheses, since order of operations ensures multiplication is done first. So that's acceptable. So that's the answer.\n</think>\n\n<answer>65 + 69 - 7 * 1 = 127</answer>"}]}

I need to make an equation using 75, 31, 1, and 34, each exactly once, with basic operations to get 979. Hmm, 979 is a pretty big number. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, maybe I should look at the largest numbers and see how they can be combined. 75 is the biggest here. If I multiply 75 by something, that could get me close. Let's see: 75 times 13 is 975, which is close to 979. But how can I get 13 from the remaining numbers 31, 1, 34? Wait, 34 minus 31 is 3, then 3 plus 1 is 4. That's not helpful. Or maybe 31 minus (34/1) would be 31 -34 = -3, which also doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 75 multiplied by something else. Let's see, 75 * 12 = 900, which is too low. 75*13=975, as before. So if I can get 13 from the other numbers. Wait, 34 - 31 = 3, and then 3 +1=4. No. Alternatively, 31 - (34/1) = -3. Not helpful. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 75 * 31 is 2325, which is way too big. But if I subtract something from that. 2325 - (34 *1) = 2325 -34=2291. Still way over. Not helpful.\n\nWhat if I add 75 and 31 first? 75+31=106. Then multiply by something. 106*9=954, which is less than 979. 106*9.3 is about 986. But I can't use fractions here. Maybe 106*9 + something? But I need to use all numbers.\n\nWait, maybe 34 is involved in a division. Let's see. If I do 75 * (34 - (31/1)), let's calculate that: 31/1 is 31, so 34-31=3. 75*3=225. Not close.\n\nOr maybe 75 * 34 = 2550. Then subtract 31*1=31. 2550 -31=2519. Still way off.\n\nAlternatively, 34 multiplied by 31 is 1054. That's over 979. 1054-75=979. Wait, 1054 -75 = 979. Oh! Wait, 34*31 is 1054, then subtract 75. But where does the 1 come into play? Because all numbers must be used once. So I need to include 1 somehow. Hmm.\n\nSo 34*31 = 1054. Then 1054 -75 = 979. But then the 1 hasn't been used. How can I incorporate the 1 without changing the result? Maybe divide or multiply by 1. Since multiplying by 1 doesn't change the value. So maybe (34*31 -75)*1. But that's still 979. But is that allowed? Let me check: 34, 31, 75, and 1 are all used. Yes. So the equation would be (34 × 31 - 75) × 1 = 979. That works. Let me verify:\n\n34 *31 is 1054. 1054 -75 is 979. Multiply by 1 is still 979. So yes, that's correct. So the equation is (34*31 -75)*1. But wait, can we write it without the parentheses? Let me check the order of operations. Multiplication and division have higher precedence than addition and subtraction. So 34*31 is 1054, then subtract 75, which is 979, then multiply by 1. Alternatively, if written as 34*31 -75*1, that would be 1054 -75 = 979. Wait, no. Wait, 34*31 is 1054, 75*1 is 75. 1054 -75 = 979. So the equation could be 34*31 -75*1 = 979. But does that use all numbers? 34, 31, 75, and 1. Yes. Each used once. That works.\n\nSo that's the equation: 34 × 31 - 75 × 1 = 979. Let me check the math again: 34 *31 is indeed 1054. 75 *1 is 75. 1054 -75 is 979. Perfect. So this equation uses all four numbers once each with multiplication and subtraction. That should be the answer.\n</think>\n\n<answer>34*31 - 75*1 = 979</answer>"}]}

Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's recall the target is 570. Let me list the numbers I have: 76, 616, 66, 36. I need to use all of them once. Hmm. Let's see. Maybe start by looking for combinations that can get close to 570.\n\nLooking at the largest number, 616. If I subtract something from 616, maybe that could get me down to 570. Let's see: 616 - 46 = 570. But do I have a 46? Well, I have 76, 66, 36. Wait, maybe combining numbers. For example, 76 - 36 = 40. Then 616 - 40 = 576. Close, but not 570. Hmm. Or 66 - 36 = 30. Then 616 - 30 = 586. Still not 570.\n\nAlternatively, maybe multiply some numbers. Let's see. 76 * 66 is a big number, probably too big. 76*7 = 532, so 76*7.5 would be 570, but I don't have 7.5. Alternatively, maybe 616 divided by something. 616 divided by 1.08 is about 570, but that's not helpful.\n\nWait, 616 - (76 - 36) = 616 - 40 = 576, which is 6 more than 570. How can I adjust that? If I use the 66, maybe subtract 6. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe 616 - 66 = 550. Then 550 + 20 = 570. Where would 20 come from? 76 - 36 = 40, but 40 is too much. Hmm. 36 divided by something? 36 / (76/66) maybe? That seems complicated.\n\nWait, let's try another approach. Maybe start with 66 multiplied by something. 66*8=528, 66*9=594. 594 is close to 570. 594 - 24 = 570. Where would 24 come from? 76 - 36 = 40. Not helpful. Alternatively, 36 - (something). Maybe not.\n\nWhat if I use division? For example, 616 divided by something. Let's see 616 / 1.08 is approximately 570, but how to get 1.08 from 76, 66, 36. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 76 * 6 = 456. 456 + 114 = 570. Can I get 114 from the other numbers? 616 - 66 - 36 = 514. That's not helpful. Hmm.\n\nWait, another idea: 66 * 36 = 2376. That's way too big. Maybe divide 616 by 76. Let's calculate that: 616 /76 = 8.105... Not an integer. Maybe 616 / 66 = 9.333... Hmm.\n\nWhat if I subtract 616 and 76. 616 -76=540. Then 540 +30=570. Where's 30? 66-36=30. So putting it together: (616 -76) + (66-36) = 540 +30=570. Let's check that: 616-76=540, 66-36=30. 540+30=570. Yes! Wait, but the numbers used are 616,76,66,36. All used once. So that's 616 -76 +66 -36 = 570. Let me compute that step by step. 616 -76 is 540, 540 +66 is 606, 606 -36 is 570. Yes! So the equation would be 616 - 76 + 66 - 36 = 570. But do I need parentheses? Let's see, since addition and subtraction are left associative, it's the same as ((616 -76) +66) -36. But maybe the user doesn't require parentheses unless necessary. But the problem says \"equation\" using the numbers each once with operations. So perhaps the equation is written as 616 -76 +66 -36 =570. Let me verify again:\n\n616 -76 = 540\n\n540 +66 = 606\n\n606 -36 = 570.

Let me start by thinking about how to get close to 900.\n\nFirst, maybe multiply some of the larger numbers. 72 is the biggest, then 64, 34, and 24. Let me try 72 multiplied by something. If I do 72 * 12, that's 864, which is close but not enough. Wait, but maybe if I combine other numbers. Let's see, 64 and 24. 64 + 24 is 88. If I multiply 72 by 88, that's 6336, way too big. Maybe subtract instead? 64 - 24 is 40. Then 72 * 40 is 2880. Still way over.\n\nAlternatively, maybe divide some numbers. If I take 72 divided by 24, that's 3. Then 64 * 3 is 192. Hmm, but then we have 34 left. 192 + 34 is 226. Not close. Maybe subtract? 192 -34=158. Still no.\n\nWait, maybe combine 34 and 72 first. 34 +72=106. Then 106 * something. Let's see, using 64 and 24. 64*24=1536. 1536 - 106=1430. Not helpful.\n\nWhat if I do 72 -34=38. Then 38 *24=912. Then 912 +64=976. Hmm, 976 is still under 1000 but over 918. Wait, 976- something? But I can't use numbers again. Wait, maybe 72 -34=38, then 38*(24 + something). Wait, but 24 is already used. No, each number once.\n\nAlternatively, 72*24=1728. Then 1728 -64=1664. Then 1664 -34=1630. Not helpful. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe use multiplication and addition together. Let's think: 918 divided by 72 is approximately 12.75. So if I can get 12.75 from the other numbers... but that's fractions. Let's see: 34 divided by 24 is about 1.416. Then 64 +1.416=65.416. 72*65.416 is around 4700. Not right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 64*34=2176. Then 72*24=1728. 2176-1728=448. Not 918.\n\nWait, maybe combine operations in a different order. Let's try 64*24=1536. Then 34*72=2448. Then 2448 -1536=912. Close to 918. But 912 is 6 less. How to get that 6? Wait, but I can't reuse numbers. Hmm, maybe that's not the path.\n\nAnother approach: 72*34=2448. Then 2448 divided by something. 24 and 64 left. 2448 /24=102. Then 102 +64=166. No. 2448/64=38.25. Then 38.25 +24=62.25. Not helpful.\n\nWhat about 72*(34 +24)? 34+24=58. 72*58=4176. Then 4176 divided by 64 is 65.25. Not helpful.\n\nWait, 918 divided by 34 is approximately 27. So maybe 34*(something)=918. Let's see, 34*27=918. So can I get 27 from 64,24,72? Let's see. 72 - 64 =8, then 24 -8=16. Not 27. 24 + (72/64)=24+1.125=25.125. Still not 27. 72 divided by 24=3. Then 64 -3=61. 34*61=2074. Not helpful.\n\nHmm. Maybe 64* (something) + or - another number. Let's see. 64*14=896. 918-896=22. Do I have 22 left? 72,24,34. 72-34=38. 38-24=14. Not 22. Alternatively, 34-24=10. 72-10=62. Not 22.\n\nAlternatively, 72*12=864. 918-864=54. Can I make 54 from 34,64,24? 34 +24=58. 58-64= -6. No. 64-24=40. 40+34=74. No. 64/(34-24)=64/10=6.4. 72*6.4=460.8. Not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps (72 + 64) * something. 72+64=136. 136*7=952. 918 is 34 less. Hmm, but 34 is one of the numbers. So 136*7 -34=952-34=918. Wait, but where does 7 come from? Let's check if 7 can be made from 24 and 34. Wait, 34-24=10. Not 7. Alternatively, 24/(34- something). Hmm, not sure.\n\nWait, maybe 72 + 64=136. Then 136 * (24 - something). 24 - x. Let's see, 24 - (34/ something). If I do 34 divided by 34, that's 1, but I can't reuse numbers. Wait, the numbers left are 24 and 34. If I do 34/(24)≈1.416. Then 24 -1.416≈22.583. 136*22.583≈3071. Not helpful.\n\nThis is tricky. Maybe another approach. Let's think of 918 as 900 +18. How to get 900? 72*12.5=900. But fractions. Alternatively, 24*37.5=900. Hmm, not helpful. 64*14.0625=900. Also fractions. Maybe 34*26.47≈900. Nope.\n\nWait, 34*27=918. So if I can get 27 from 64,24,72. Let me check. 72 - 64=8. 24 +8=32. No. 72/24=3. 64 -3=61. Then 34*61=2074. Not helpful. 72 divided by (64/24). Let's compute 64/24=2.666..., then 72 divided by that is 72/(64/24)=72*(24/64)=27. Oh! Wait, that's 27. Then 34*27=918. So let's put that together.\n\nSo 72 divided by (64 divided by 24) equals 27. Then multiply that by 34. Let's check:\n\n64 divided by 24 is 64/24 = 8/3 ≈2.6667.\n\nThen 72 divided by (8/3) is 72*(3/8)=27. Then 27*34=918. Yes! So the equation would be 34 * (72 / (64 / 24)) = 918.\n\nLet me verify:\n\nFirst, 64 divided by 24 is 64/24 = 2.666...\n\nThen 72 divided by that is 72 / (64/24) = 72 * (24/64) = (72*24)/64. Let's compute that:\n\n72*24=1728\n\n1728/64=27. Correct.\n\nThen 27*34=918. Exactly.\n\nSo the equation is 34 * (72 / (64 / 24)) = 918. All numbers used once, operations are division and multiplication. Yes, that works.\n</think>\n\n<answer>34 * (72 / (64 / 24)) = 918</answer>"}]}

For example, 96 + 4 = 100. But I don't have a 4. Alternatively, 96 plus something else. Let me check what's left: 33, 37, and 1. If I could use 37 and 33 somehow. Wait, 37 - 33 is 4. So 96 + (37 - 33) +1? Wait, but that would be 96 +4 +1=101, which is too much. Hmm. Or maybe 96 + (37 -33 -1)=96+3=99. Close, but not 100. \n\nAlternatively, maybe multiply some numbers. Let's see. 33 and 37 are both primes, but 33 is 3*11 and 37 is a prime. 96 is 3*32 or 16*6, etc. Maybe combining them. For instance, 37 - 33 = 4. Then 96 + 4 = 100. But then I have to use all numbers. Wait, 96 + (37 -33) = 100, but then where does the 1 go? Because I have to use all numbers. Oh right, I have to use 1 as well. So that approach uses 96,37,33 but leaves out 1. So that's not allowed.\n\nHmm. Maybe I need to use division or multiplication. Let's think. 96 divided by something? 96/ (something) = maybe part of the equation. For example, 96 divided by (33 - 37) but that would be negative, not sure. Alternatively, 33 * 3 is 99, which is close to 100. But 3 isn't one of the numbers. Wait, but maybe combine with other numbers. Let's see.\n\nAnother idea: 37 + 33 = 70. Then 70 + something with 96 and 1. But 70 + 96 is 166, which is way over. Hmm. Or 96 - (37 +33) = 96 -70=26, then 26*1=26. Not helpful. \n\nWhat if I subtract 37 from 96? 96-37=59. Then 59 +33=92, still not 100. Then adding 1 would be 93. No. \n\nAlternatively, maybe 37* something. 37*3=111, which is over. 37*2=74. Then 74 + 96= 170, which is way over. Not helpful. \n\nWait, maybe use division. Let's see. For example, (96 / (something)) + something else. Let's try 96 divided by (something involving 33 and 1). 96/(33-1) =96/32=3. Then 3 +37=40. Not 100. \n\nOr 96/(33 +1) =96/34 ≈2.8235... Not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, 37 divided by 1 is 37. Then 96 + 37=133. Then 133 -33=100. Wait, that uses 96, 37, 1 (as 37/1) and 33. Let me check: 96 + (37 /1) -33 =96 +37 -33=96 +4=100. Yes! That works. Because 37 divided by 1 is 37, then adding to 96 gives 133, subtract 33 gives 100. And all numbers are used once: 96, 37, 1, and 33. \n\nSo the equation would be 96 + 37/1 -33 =100. Let me verify: 37 divided by 1 is 37. 96 +37 is 133. 133 minus 33 is 100. Yep. That works. So all numbers are used once with +, /, and - operations. \n\nI think that's the solution. Let me just check if there's another way, but this seems to fit. Let me see if there's a different approach. Maybe using multiplication. For instance, 33*3 is 99, but where would the 3 come from? Not directly. Alternatively, 96 - (37 -33) +1. Wait, 96 -4 +1=93. No. Or (96 +37) - (33 +1)=133 -34=99. Not 100. Close. \n\nAlternatively, (37 -1) * something. 36 * something. 36*3=108. But again, 3 isn't available. Hmm. \n\nAnother idea: 96 + 33 =129. Then 129 -37=92. 92 +8=100, but 8 is not available. Alternatively, 129 - (37 -1)=129 -36=93. Not enough. \n\nWait, perhaps using division with 33 and 1. 33/1=33. Then 96 +37 -33= same as before. So that's the same as the previous solution. \n\nYes, so the correct equation is 96 + 37/1 -33 =100. All numbers used once, operations are +, /, and -. \n\nAlternatively, written with parentheses: (37 / 1) +96 -33. But the order of operations would still give the same result. So the equation is valid.\n</think>\n\n<answer>96 + 37/1 - 33 = 100</answer>"}]}

Let's start by thinking about possible operations. Since 993 is a large number, maybe I can divide it by something to get a smaller number. Let's see, 993 divided by... maybe 25? Let me check: 993 ÷ 25 is about 39.72. Oh, that's close to 39. But how do I adjust it to get exactly 39? Maybe subtract something. Wait, if I do 993 divided by 25, that's 39.72, and then subtract 0.72, but I need to use the other numbers (59 and 41). Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe combine 59 and 41 first. Let's try adding them: 59 + 41 = 100. Then subtract 25: 100 - 25 = 75. But that's way higher than 39. What if I multiply or divide? If I take 59 - 41 = 18. Then 18 + 25 = 43. Still not 39. \n\nWait, maybe 59 - (41 - 25). Let's calculate that: 41 -25 is 16, then 59 -16 is 43. Still not. How about (59 + 41) divided by something? 100 divided by what? 993 divided by 25 is 39.72, as before. If I could get 100 - (993/25), that would be 100 - 39.72 = 60.28. Not helpful.\n\nAnother approach: Let's see what 993 minus something gives. 993 - 59 = 934. Then 934 -41 = 893, minus 25 is 868. Too big. Not helpful. Maybe divide 993 by something else. How about 993 divided by (59 - 41). Let's calculate 59-41=18. Then 993/18=55.166... Not close.\n\nWait, 25 is a smaller number. Maybe use 25 as part of a subtraction or addition. Let's think: 41 -25 =16. Then maybe 59 -16=43. Still not 39. How about 25 - (59 -41)? 59-41=18, so 25-18=7. Then use 993 and 7 somehow. 993 divided by 7 is about 141.85... Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe multiply some numbers. For example, 25 * 41 = 1025. Then subtract 59: 1025 -59=966. Then 966 vs 993... Not sure. Maybe 993 - (25*41) +59. Let's compute 25*41=1025. 993 -1025= -32. Then -32 +59=27. Not 39.\n\nHmm. Maybe combining division and subtraction. Let's see: 993 - (59 +41) = 993 -100=893. Then 893 divided by 25 is around 35.72. Still not 39. \n\nWhat if I arrange it as (993 - something)/something else. Let's try 993 - (59*41). Wait, 59*41 is 2419. 993 -2419 is negative, so that's probably not useful.\n\nWait another angle: Maybe use fractions. For example, 993 divided by (something) minus another number. Let's see. Let's think 993 divided by a number close to 25.5, which would be 39. Let me check 993 divided by 25.5 equals 39. So maybe 993 divided by (25.5) equals 39. But 25.5 isn't one of the numbers. But perhaps I can create 25.5 using the other numbers. For example, (25 + (59 -41)/something). Let's see: 59 -41=18. If I add 25 + (18/ something). Let's say 25 + (18/2)=25 +9=34. Then 993/34 is around 29.2. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 59 - (something) to get a number that can be used as a divisor. For example, 59 -41=18. Then 993 divided by 18 is 55.16... Not helpful. But 25 is left. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe combine 41 and 25 to make a number. 41 -25=16. Then 59 -16=43. Then 993 -43=950. Not helpful. \n\nWhat if I use subtraction and division. For example, (59 - (993 / (41 +25))). Let's compute 41 +25=66. 993 divided by 66 is 15.045... Then 59 -15.045 is around 43.95. Not 39.\n\nAlternatively, 993 divided by (something) minus another number. Let's think. If I can get 993 divided by a number to be 39 plus something. For example, 993 / x = 39 + y. Not sure.\n\nWait, 39*25=975. 993 is 975 +18. So 993=39*25 +18. So maybe 39= (993 -18)/25. Then 18 can be made from 59 and 41. 59 -41=18. So then (993 - (59 -41))/25. Let's check: 59 -41=18, 993-18=975, 975/25=39. Yes! That works. So the equation would be (993 - (59 -41)) /25 =39. Let me verify: 59-41=18, 993-18=975, 975 divided by 25 is indeed 39. Perfect! All numbers are used once: 993,59,41,25. And operations are subtraction and division. So the equation is (993 - (59 - 41)) / 25 = 39.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(993 - (59 - 41)) / 25 = 39</answer>"}]}

If I can multiply 378 by something to get close to 972, that might work. 378 multiplied by 2 is 756, which is too low. 378 times 3 is 1134, which is higher than 972. Hmm. So maybe 378 times 2.5 would get to 945, but that's still not 972. Wait, maybe using division to get a multiplier? Let's see.\n\nAnother approach: 972 divided by 378 is approximately 2.571... That's not a whole number, but maybe if I can create a fraction using the other numbers. Let's see what numbers are left: 49, 86, 4. How can these numbers combine to give a value that when multiplied by 378 gives 972?\n\nAlternatively, maybe subtract or add some values to 378 multiplied by something. Let's think. If 378 * 2 is 756, then 972 - 756 = 216. So maybe I need to create 216 using the remaining numbers 49, 86, 4. Hmm. Let's see: 86 - 49 = 37, then 37 * 4 = 148. That's not 216. Alternatively, 86 + 49 = 135, 135 + 4 = 139. Not enough. 86 * 4 = 344, 344 + 49 = 393. No. 86 * 3 would be 258, but I don't have a 3. Wait, maybe 49 * 4 = 196, then 196 + 86 = 282. 378 * 2 + 282 = 756 + 282 = 1038, which is over. Not helpful.\n\nWait another angle: Maybe use 86 and 49 to make a multiplier. Let's see, 86 - 49 = 37. Then 37 * 4 = 148. Adding that to 378*2=756, gives 904. Still not 972. Alternatively, 86 + 49 = 135. 135 * 4 = 540. 540 + 378 = 918, which is still less. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 86 * 4 = 344. Then 344 + 378 = 722. 722 + 49 = 771. No. Not close.\n\nWait, maybe use division. Let's see. If we can divide one number by another to get a multiplier. For example, 86 divided by 4 is 21.5. Then 21.5 * 49 is a big number, but 21.5 * 45 is 967.5, so maybe 21.5 * 45.2? Not sure. Alternatively, 378 divided by 4 is 94.5. Then 94.5 * 10 = 945. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 49 * 86 is a big number. 49*86 = 4214. Then 4214 - 378 = 3836. Divided by 4 is 959. Close but not 972. Alternatively, 49 * 86 = 4214, 4214 / 4 = 1053.5, then subtract 378: 1053.5 - 378 = 675.5. No.\n\nHmm, maybe trying a different structure. Let's see, 972 can be broken down into 972 = 9 * 108, or 12*81, etc. But how to get those factors from the given numbers. Alternatively, 972 is 18*54. Let me see if the numbers can form those factors. 378 is 54*7, but that might not help. Alternatively, 86 - 49 = 37, 37* something. Not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps 86 * 4 = 344, then 344 * (something). 344 * 3 = 1032. If I can get 3 from the other numbers. 378 divided by 49 is roughly 7.714, not 3. Alternatively, 49 - 4 = 45, then 45 divided by something. 45 / 15 = 3, but how to get 15. Not obvious.\n\nAnother thought: 378 + 86 = 464. 464 * 2 = 928. Then 928 + 49 = 977. Close to 972, but over. Alternatively, 378 + 86 = 464, 464 * 2 = 928, then 49 - 4 = 45, 928 + 45 = 973. Still off by 1. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe subtract. Let's see, 86 * 4 = 344. Then 344 * 3 = 1032. 1032 - (378 - 49) = 1032 - 329 = 703. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, (86 + 4) = 90. 90 * 10.8 = 972. But where to get 10.8. 49 and 378? 378 / 49 is approximately 7.714. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 378 * (4 + (86 / 49)). Let's compute that. 86 / 49 is approximately 1.755. 4 + 1.755 is 5.755. 378 * 5.755 is way over 972. Maybe that's not the way.\n\nWait, maybe use 378 * (something) divided by something. For example, (378 * 86) / (49 - 4). Let's compute denominator: 49 -4 =45. 378*86=32508. 32508 /45= 722.4. Not 972.\n\nAlternatively, (49 * 86) * (4) / 378. Let's see: 49*86=4214, 4214*4=16856, 16856/378≈44.6. Not helpful.\n\nHmm, maybe using subtraction. 378 * 3 is 1134. Then subtract something. 1134 - (86 +49 +4)=1134 -139=995. Still not 972. Wait, 1134 - 162=972. How to get 162? 86 + 49 +4=139. No. 86*2=172. But we don't have another 86. Alternatively, 49*3 + 86=147+86=233. No. Not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps 86 * (4 + 49) =86*53=4558. 4558 - 378=4180. Not close.\n\nAnother approach: Let's see the target is 972. Let's see, 972 divided by 4 is 243. So maybe 243 *4=972. How can I get 243 from 49,86,378. 378 - 86=292. 292-49=243. So 378 -86 -49=243. Then 243 *4=972. That uses all numbers except 4. Wait, but if I do (378 -86 -49) *4 = (243)*4=972. But then I have used 378,86,49,4. All four numbers. That works!\n\nWait, let me check:\n\n378 minus 86 is 292. Then 292 minus 49 is 243. Then 243 multiplied by 4 is 972. Yes! So the equation would be (378 - 86 - 49) * 4 = 972. Let me verify the arithmetic:\n\n378 -86 = 292\n\n292 -49 = 243\n\n243 *4= 972\n\nPerfect! So the equation is (378 - 86 - 49) * 4 = 972. All numbers used once, only subtraction and multiplication. That should work.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(378 - 86 - 49) * 4 = 972</answer>"}]}

Hmm.\n\nFirst, let's think about the target number, 504. I know that 504 is a multiple of 49. Let me check: 49 times 10 is 490, and 490 plus 14 is 504. So 49*10.285... but that's not an integer. Wait, 49 multiplied by 10.285 is approximately 504. But maybe there's a way to use 49 in a multiplication to get close.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 499 is the largest number here. If I subtract something from 499 to get 504, but that would need the subtracted number to be negative, which might not be possible with the given numbers. Wait, 499 is less than 504, so maybe adding instead. Let's see: 499 + something. Let's say 499 + 5 = 504. But do I have a 5? The numbers I have left are 49, 3, 47. Hmm, not directly. But maybe 49 - 47 = 2, and then 3 - 2 =1, but that might not help. Alternatively, 47 - 3 =44, then 499 +44=543, which is way over. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe multiply some numbers. Let's see, 49 is a big number. If I multiply 49 by 10, that's 490, which is close to 504. Then add 14. But how to get 14 from 499, 3, 47? Wait, 47 - (3 * something). 47 - (3*11)=47-33=14. But 11 isn't a number here. Alternatively, 499 divided by 47? Let me compute that: 499 ÷47 ≈10.617. Not helpful. \n\nWait, 3 * 47 =141. Then 499 -141=358. Not sure. Alternatively, 499 +47=546. Then 546 -49=497. Then 497 +3=500. No, that's not 504.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 49 * 3 =147. Then 147 +47=194. 499 -194=305. Not helpful. Hmm.\n\nLet me think differently. Let's see what 504 can be broken down into. 504 divided by 49 is 10.2857… so maybe 49*10 + something. But 49*10 is 490. 490 +14=504. So how can I get 14 from 499,3,47? 47 - (3*11)=14, but again 11 isn't there. Alternatively, 499 - (47*10.6) but fractions might complicate. Wait, maybe using division. For example, 499 - (47/3). 47 divided by 3 is around 15.666. 499 -15.666≈483.333. Then 483.333 +49=532.333. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe combine multiplication and addition. Let's see: 49 * 10 is 490. Then 490 +14=504. So 14 could be 47 - (3 * something). Let's see: 47 - (3*11)=14. But how to get 11? Wait, maybe using 499. If I take 499 and subtract something to get 11. But 499 is way too big. Alternatively, 499 divided by something. 499 ÷47≈10.617. So 10.617… Hmm. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe 47 - 3 =44. Then 499 -44=455. 455 +49=504. Wait, that works! Let me check: 499 - (47 -3) +49. Let's compute step by step. 47-3=44. 499-44=455. 455+49=504. But wait, are we allowed to use all numbers? Let's list the numbers used: 499,47,3,49. Yes, all four numbers. So the equation would be 499 - (47 -3) +49 =504. But let's confirm the order of operations. Since subtraction and addition are left associative, but the parentheses here clarify. So (47-3)=44, then 499 -44=455, then 455+49=504. Yes. So that uses all numbers: 499,47,3,49. Each once. So the equation is 499 - (47 - 3) +49 =504. Let me check again: 47-3=44; 499-44=455; 455+49=504. Yes, that adds up. So this works.\n</think>\n\n<answer>499 + 49 - (47 - 3) = 504</answer>"}]}

So maybe that's not the way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps combining them with other operations. Let's see. 94 divided by something? 94 is a big number, but 585 is bigger. So maybe not division. Let's think of adding. If I add 94 and 59, that's 153. Still small. Maybe multiply the sum by something. 153 * 4 would be 612, which is close to 585. But 4 is not one of the numbers. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe 94 multiplied by 18. Let's compute 94*18. 90*18=1620, 4*18=72, so 1620+72=1692. That's way too high. What about 59 multiplied by 18? 59*18: 50*18=900, 9*18=162, so total 1062. Still over. Hmm. 24*18 is 432. If I add 94 and 59, that's 153. 432 + 153 = 585. Wait, that's exactly 585. But wait, let me check. 24*18 is 432. Then adding 94 and 59: 94+59=153. 432 + 153 = 585. But wait, that uses 24*18 + 94 + 59. But that uses all four numbers once each. Wait, 24*18 uses 24 and 18. Then adding 94 and 59 uses the remaining two numbers. So that would be 24*18 + 94 + 59 = 432 + 153 = 585. But let me check the arithmetic again. 24 times 18: 24*10=240, 24*8=192, 240+192=432. Correct. 94+59 is 153. 432+153=585. That works! But wait, are all numbers used once? Yes: 24, 18, 94, 59. All used once. So the equation would be (24 * 18) + 94 + 59 = 585. Let me see if that's the case. Yes. Alternatively, maybe parentheses aren't needed, but multiplication has higher precedence, so it's 24*18 +94 +59. But perhaps to group it, they might write (24 * 18) + 94 + 59. That seems correct. Let me check if that's correct. Yeah, that's 432 + 153 = 585. Perfect. So that's the equation.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(24 * 18) + 94 + 59 = 585</answer>"}]}

Each number can be used only once, and I have to use all of them. The target is 795. Hmm. Let's start by thinking about possible operations. Since 795 is a relatively large number, maybe multiplication will be involved. Let me check what combinations could get close to that.\n\nFirst, looking at the numbers: 74 is the largest, followed by 53, 37, and 30. If I multiply some of the bigger numbers together, maybe that gets me close. Let's try 74 multiplied by something. 74 times 10 is 740, which is less than 795. But how can I get 10 using the remaining numbers? Wait, I have 30, 37, and 53 left. Let me see: 30 minus (53 - 37) equals 30 - 16 = 14. Not 10. Or maybe 53 - 37 is 16, then 30 - 16 is 14. Hmm. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 74 times 11 would be 814, which is close. How to get 11? Let's see. If I take 53 - (30 + 37), that would be 53 - 67 = negative, which isn't helpful. Alternatively, 30 + 37 = 67, then 53 - 67 is negative. Maybe subtraction isn't the way. What about division? If I can get a higher number from division. For example, 30 divided by something. Wait, 30 divided by 30/53 would be 53, but that's using two numbers. Maybe not.\n\nWait, perhaps 53 multiplied by something. 53*15 is 795. Oh! Wait, 53*15 is exactly 795. So if I can make 15 using the other numbers, 74, 30, and 37. Let's see: 74, 30, 37. How to make 15 from those. Let's see. 30 - (74 - 37) = 30 - 37 = -7. No. Alternatively, 74 - 37 = 37. Then 37 - 30 = 7. Still not 15. Hmm. Or maybe 37 - (74 - 30) = 37 - 44 = -7. Not helpful.\n\nWait, 74 minus 30 is 44. Then 44 minus 37 is 7. No. Not helpful. What if I add 74 and 30, which is 104, then subtract 37: 104 -37=67. Still not 15. Alternatively, 74 divided by something. 74 divided by 4.933... is 15, but that's not helpful. Wait, maybe 30 divided by 2 is 15. But how to get 2 from the remaining numbers. If I have 74, 37, and 53. 74 minus 53 is 21. 37 minus 21 is 16. Not 2. Hmm. Alternatively, 37 divided by (74 - 53). Let's see: 74-53=21. 37/21 is approximately 1.76. Then 30 divided by 1.76 is roughly 17. Not 15. Maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 53 multiplied by (74 - (37 + 30)). Let's calculate: 37 +30=67. 74 -67=7. Then 53*7=371. Not enough. Hmm.\n\nAnother approach: Let's think of combining two numbers to get a larger intermediate number. For example, 74 * 53 = 3922. That's way too big. Maybe subtract something. If I do 74*53 - 37*30. Let's calculate: 74*53=3922, 37*30=1110. 3922 -1110=2812. Still too big. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe (74 + 53) * something. 74+53=127. 127*6=762. 127*6.3=800.1. Close. But how to get 6.3? Not sure. Using 30 and 37. 30/37≈0.81. So 6 + 0.81=6.81. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 30 * 53 = 1590. Then 1590 - 74*37=1590 -2738= -1148. Nope. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe 74 * (30 - (53 -37)). Let's compute inside the parentheses: 53-37=16. Then 30-16=14. 74*14=1036. Not 795. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, 53 * (74 - 30 -37). Let's compute: 74-30=44. 44-37=7. 53*7=371. No.\n\nWait, another idea: maybe division. For example, if I can divide two numbers to get a multiplier. Let's say, 74 * (53 - (37 / 30)). Wait, 37 divided by 30 is approximately 1.233. Then 53 -1.233≈51.767. 74*51.767≈74*50=3700 +74*1.767≈130.758≈3830.758. Way too big. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, (74 + 37) * (53 -30). Let's compute: 74+37=111, 53-30=23. 111*23=2553. Not 795.\n\nHmm. Maybe subtraction. 74*30=2220. Then 2220 - 53*37. Let's compute 53*37=1961. 2220-1961=259. Not 795.\n\nAlternatively, 53*30=1590. 1590 -74*37=1590-2738=-1148. No.\n\nWait, maybe 37*30=1110. Then 1110 - (74+53)=1110-127=983. Not 795.\n\nHmm. Let me think again. The earlier thought where 53*15=795. So if I can get 15 from 74, 30, and 37. How?\n\nWait, 74 - 37 = 37. Then 37 -30=7. Not 15.\n\nAlternatively, 30 + (37 - something). Wait, 30 + (37 - 74). But that would be 30 + (-37)= -7. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe (74 - (37 +30))? 37+30=67. 74-67=7. So 53*7=371. No.\n\nAlternatively, 30 + (74 -37 -53). Let's see: 74-37=37. 37-53= -16. 30 + (-16)=14. 53*14=742. Close, but not 795.\n\nWait, 53*15=795. Let's think: 15 is 30/2. So if I can get 2 from 74 and 37. For example, 74 divided by 37 is 2. Yes! So 74 /37=2. Then 30 / (74/37) =30/2=15. Then 53*15=795. Let me check:\n\n53 * (30 / (74 / 37)) = ?\n\nFirst compute 74 divided by 37: 74/37=2. Then 30 divided by that is 15. Then 53*15=795. Yes! That works. So the equation would be 53 * (30 / (74 / 37)). Let me check if all numbers are used once: 53, 30, 74, 37. Yes, all four numbers are used once. So that's the equation: 53 × (30 ÷ (74 ÷ 37)) = 795. Let me verify the calculation step by step.\n\nFirst, 74 divided by 37 is 2. Then 30 divided by 2 is 15. Then 53 multiplied by 15 is indeed 795. Perfect. That works.\n</think>\n\n<answer>53 * (30 / (74 / 37))</answer>"}]}

Alternatively, maybe subtract. If I take 83 - 28, that's 55. Then 77 - 64 is 13. 55 and 13 don't get me to 124 either.\n\nWait, maybe combine operations. Let's think about multiplying.

Let me see. 64 divided by 28 is roughly 2.285, but that's not an integer. Maybe not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, what if I take 83 and subtract something. Let's say 83 - 28 = 55. Then maybe multiply by something. But 55 times 2 is 110. Not enough. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe combine two numbers and then use the others. Like 77 + 64 = 141. Then subtract something.

How to get 12 from the remaining numbers. 83-77=6, and 64 divided by something. Hmm. 64 divided by (83-77) is 64/6≈10.666. Then 112 + 10.666 is 122.666, not 124.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 64 divided by something else. Wait, 28*4=112. But how do I get 4? 64 divided by 16 is 4. But how to get 16 from 83 and 77. 83-77=6.

Let me see what operations might get me there. \n\nSince 718 is a large number, maybe I can subtract something from it to get close to 618. Let's check: 718 - 100 = 618. So if I can get 100 using the other numbers 41, 57, and 84. But how? Let me see. The remaining numbers are 41, 57, 84. Maybe I can combine them to make 100. Let's try adding 57 and 41: 57 + 41 = 98. Then 98 plus 84 is 182, which is too much. Wait, but 84 minus (57 - 41) might be something. 57-41 is 16, then 84-16=68. Hmm, 718 - 68 = 650. Not quite. Maybe 718 - (84 + 57 +41). That would be 84+57=141, +41=182. 718-182=536, which is still too low.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to multiply some numbers. Let's see. If I take 57 and 84, multiplying them would give 57*84=4788, which is way too big. Maybe divide 84 by something. 84 divided by 41 is roughly 2.048. Then 57*2.048 would be around 116. So 718 - 116 = 602. Close but not 618. Hmm. Maybe a different approach.\n\nWhat if I use division to create a smaller number. For example, 718 divided by something. 718 divided by, say, 84 is roughly 8.547. Not helpful. Or 718 divided by 57 is around 12.6. Still not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, maybe multiply 57 and 41: 57*41=2337. Then subtract 84: 2337-84=2253. Then subtract that from 718? 718 -2253 would be negative. Not helpful. \n\nWait, perhaps 718 - (84 * something). Let's see. 84*7=588. 718-588=130. Then maybe using 57 and 41. 57 +41=98. 130-98=32. Not helpful. Alternatively, 84*6=504. 718-504=214.

But where's the 3? Maybe 41 divided by something. 41/ (some number). Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, 57* (something). Let's think. 57*10=570. 570 +48=618. How to get 48? 84 - 41=43.

So maybe 57*(10.84)=618. But how to get 10.84 from the other numbers. 718 divided by (84-41) = 718/43 ≈16.697. Not helpful. \n\nWait, perhaps 84 - 41 = 43.

I need to create an equation using the numbers 32, 5, 32, and 39, each exactly once, and the result has to be 195. Hmm. Let me start by thinking about what operations can get me close to 195. \n\nFirst, 195 is a bit over 200, so maybe multiplication could be involved. Let's look at the numbers: there are two 32s, a 5, and a 39. Since 32 is a larger number, multiplying it by something might help. Let's see, 32 times 5 is 160, which is less than 195. Then if I add the other 32, that's 160 + 32 = 192. Still a bit short. Then add 39? Wait, but I can't use numbers more than once. Wait, no, I need to use all four numbers once. So maybe that approach isn't right.\n\nWait, let me list the numbers again: 32, 5, 32, 39. So two 32s. Let's see, maybe combine the two 32s first. For example, 32 + 32 is 64. Then multiply by something. 64 * 5 is 320, which is way higher than 195. Then subtract 39? 320 - 39 = 281. Not 195. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, what if I subtract the two 32s? 32 - 32 = 0. That's not helpful. Maybe 32 divided by 32 is 1. Then use that with 5 and 39. Maybe 1 + 5 = 6, then 6 * 39 = 234. Still not 195. Hmm.\n\nWhat if I use 39 and 5? 39 * 5 is 195. Oh! Wait, that's exactly the target. But I need to use all four numbers. So if I can get 39 multiplied by 5, but then how do I incorporate the two 32s? Because 39*5 is already 195, but I have the two 32s left. That's a problem. Unless I can somehow subtract or add them in a way that cancels them out. But since they have to be used, maybe I can have 39*5 + 32 -32. That would be 195 +0 =195. But then I used all four numbers: 39,5,32,32. So yes, that works. Let's check: 39 * 5 + 32 -32. The 32 and -32 cancel out, so it's 195. But is that allowed? The problem says each number can only be used once. So the two 32s are each used once. So that would be valid. Let me make sure the equation is structured correctly. So (39 * 5) + (32 - 32). Which is 195 +0=195. Yes. That uses all four numbers once. So that's a possible solution. But let me verify if that's acceptable. The problem says you can use the numbers once each. Since there are two 32s, each is used once in the equation. So 32 and 32 are separate numbers. So in the equation, 39 multiplied by 5 plus 32 minus 32. So that's correct. That seems to work. Let me check if there are other ways too. Alternatively, maybe 32 * 5 is 160, plus 32 is 192, and then 39 minus something? Wait, but 192 + 3 would be 195, but where does 3 come from? 39 - 36, but 36 isn't here. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe 32 divided by something. Let's think. 32 * (5 + something) + 39? Let's see. If I take 32*(5 + x) +39 =195. Then 32x + 160 +39 =195. So 32x =195-199= -4. That's x=-4/32. Not helpful. \n\nAnother approach: 39 is the largest number. If I can multiply 39 by 5, that's 195. Then the 32s could be subtracted and added. So 39*5 +32-32. Exactly the same as before. So that's the solution. So the equation is 39*5 +32-32. Let me just make sure that all numbers are used exactly once. Yes: 39, 5, 32, 32. Each is used once. So that's valid. Another way to write it could be (39 * 5) + (32 - 32). But order of operations might not matter here. So yeah, that should be the answer.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(39 * 5) + 32 - 32</answer>"}]}

Let me start by thinking about possible combinations.\n\nFirst, 85 is the largest number here. If I can multiply it by something to get close to 303, that might help. 85 times 3 is 255, which is under. 85 times 4 is 340, which is over. Hmm. Maybe I can adjust with the other numbers.\n\nWhat if I subtract or add the other numbers to 85? Let's see: 85 + 28 = 113. Still too low. 85 * 3.5 would be around 297.5, which is close to 303. But how to get 3.5 from the remaining numbers. The remaining numbers are 28, 10, 19. Wait, I can't use 85 again. Oh right, each number must be used once. So maybe 85 multiplied by something plus another number.\n\nWait, let's see. 28 and 19 could be combined. 28 - 19 = 9. Then 85 * (something) plus or minus that. Let's see: 85 * 3 = 255. 255 + 28 + 19 +10... No, that uses all numbers but adds up to 85 +28+19+10=142, which is way off. Maybe multiplication and division.\n\nAlternatively, let's try to make 303. Since 303 is 300 +3. Let's see. If I can get 300 first. 85 * 3.5 is 297.5, which is close. How to get 3.5? Maybe 28 divided by 8. But 8 isn't available. Wait, 28 divided by (19-10) is 28/9 ≈3.111. Then 85 * (28/(19-10)) + something. 85*(28/9) ≈85*3.111≈264. Then 264 + 19=283, which is still under. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 85*3 + 28 + 19 -10. Let's calculate that: 255 +28=283, 283+19=302, 302-10=292. Not 303. Close though.\n\nWait, 85*3 is 255. 255 + 48 = 303. How to get 48 from 28,10,19. 28 +19 +10=57. No. 28 + (19*10/ something). Wait, 19*10=190. 190 divided by something. 28 is left. 190/28 ≈6.785. Not helpful. Alternatively, 28 +10=38, plus 19=57. Still no.\n\nAlternatively, subtract. 85*4=340. 340 - something. 340-37=303. How to get 37 from 28,10,19. 28+10=38, 38-1=37, but how to get 1 from 19? 19-18=1, but 18 isn't available. Alternatively, 19 - (28-10)=19-18=1. So 340 - (19 - (28-10))=340-1=339. Not helpful.\n\nWait another angle: Maybe (85 + 28) * something. 85+28=113. 113 * 2.68 ≈303. But getting 2.68 from 10 and 19. Maybe 19/10=1.9. Then 113*1.9=214.7. Not close. Alternatively, 113*(19-10)=113*9=1017. Way over.\n\nHmm. Let me try division. Maybe 85 divided by something. 85/ (something) plus or minus others. For example, 85/ (19-10)=85/9≈9.444. Then 9.444 +28 +10=47.444. No.\n\nAlternatively, 28*10=280. 280 +19=299. Then 299 +85=384. No. Not helpful.\n\nWait, 28*10=280. Then 280 + (85 -19)=280+66=346. No. Not 303.\n\nWait, maybe 85 * (28 -10) + 19. Let's compute that: 85*18=1530, 1530+19=1549. Way too big.\n\nAlternatively, 85 + 28 *10 -19. 28*10=280. 85+280=365. 365-19=346. Still no.\n\nWait, maybe 85 * (10 - (28/19)). Let's see: 28/19≈1.473. 10-1.473≈8.527. 85*8.527≈724.8. Too big.\n\nAlternatively, 85 * 3.5. How to get 3.5 from the numbers. 28 divided by 8=3.5. But 8 isn't here. Wait, 19 -10=9. Then 28 divided by (19-10)=28/9≈3.111. Then 85*(28/(19-10))=85*3.111≈264. Then add the remaining number? Wait, I already used 85,28,19,10. Wait, no. If I do 85*(28/(19-10)), that's using 85,28,19,10. All four numbers. Let's compute: (85*(28/(19-10))) = 85*(28/9) ≈264.444. That's approximately 264.444. Which is not 303. So that's not it.\n\nWait, perhaps a different approach: 303 divided by 85 is approximately 3.564. So if I can get around that multiplier. Let's see. 28 +10 +19=57. Maybe 85*(28 +10 +19)/something. But that would use all numbers but not sure.\n\nWait, 85*(3.564)≈303. Let me see if I can get 3.564 using the other numbers. Maybe (28 +19)/10=47/10=4.7. Then 85*4.7=399.5. Close to 400. Not helpful.\n\nHmm. Maybe subtraction. 85*4=340. 340 -37=303. So how to get 37 from 28,10,19. 28 + 10 -19=19. Not 37. 28 +19=47, 47-10=37. Yes! So 28 +19 -10=37. Then 85*4 - (28 +19 -10)=340-37=303. But wait, 85*4 is 340. But where do I get the 4? Because I can't use numbers more than once. Wait, 4 is not in the given numbers. So this approach might not work.\n\nWait, but the numbers we have are 85,28,10,19. So if I do 85*(something) using the others. Let's see: 85*(28 - (19 -10))=85*(28-9)=85*19=1615. That's way too big.\n\nAlternatively, 85*(10) =850. Then 850 -28*19=850-532=318. Close to 303. But 318 is still 15 off. Not helpful.\n\nWait, 85*10=850. 28+19=47. 850-47=803. No.\n\nWait, maybe (85 -28) * something. 85-28=57. 57*5.315≈303. How to get 5.315 from 10 and 19? 19/10=1.9. 57*1.9=108.3. No.\n\nAlternatively, 57*(10 - (19/something)). But stuck again.\n\nAnother idea: 19*10=190. 190 +85=275. 275 +28=303. Wait, 19*10=190. 190 +85=275. 275 +28=303. That uses all numbers: 19*10 +85 +28 = 190+85=275+28=303. Wait, is that correct?\n\nYes! Let's check: 19 multiplied by 10 is 190. Then add 85: 190 +85=275. Then add 28: 275 +28=303. That uses all four numbers: 19,10,85,28. Each once, all operations are allowed. So the equation is 19*10 +85 +28 =303.\n\nWait, but let me verify:\n\n19*10=190\n\n190+85=275\n\n275+28=303\n\nYes! That works. But the problem says to use all numbers once, and the operations are allowed. So this equation is 19 * 10 +85 +28 =303. But since we can only use each number once, and we have used all four numbers. So this should be correct.\n\nBut let me check if I can write this as an equation with the required operations. So ((19 *10) +85) +28. Alternatively, 19*10 +85 +28. So the equation is 19*10 +85 +28=303.\n\nBut do I need to group them in parentheses? Since multiplication comes first, the order is 19*10 done first, then add 85, then add 28. So no parentheses needed, but to make it clear, maybe (19*10) +85 +28.\n\nBut in any case, this works. So the answer is (19 * 10) + 85 + 28 = 303. So within the answer tags, it would be <answer>19*10+85+28</answer>.\n\nWait, but I should check if this is allowed. The problem says \"create an equation that equals 303\" using the numbers once each with +, -, *, / allowed. So yes, this uses all numbers once, and the operations are multiplication and addition. So this is valid.\n</think>\n\n<answer>19*10+85+28</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using the numbers 5, 711, 66, and 60, each exactly once, with basic arithmetic operations, and the result should be 81. Hmm. Let's start by thinking about how these numbers can combine.\n\nFirst, 81 is a relatively small number compared to some of these, especially 711. So maybe I need to subtract or divide the larger numbers to bring them down. Let's list out the numbers: 5, 711, 66, 60. All must be used once.\n\nLet me think about possible operations. Maybe 711 divided by something? 711 divided by 8.8 would be around 81, but I don't have 8.8. Wait, 711 divided by 9 is 79, which is close but not 81. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps subtract a large number from another to get 81. For example, 711 - 630 is 81. But 630 isn't one of the numbers. Wait, but maybe 66 * 9.5 is 627, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, can I use 60 and 5 to make 12, and then subtract that from 93? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of 66 and 60. Their difference is 6. If I can get 6 into the equation somehow. Maybe 5 * (66 - 60) = 30, but not sure. Or 66 + 60 = 126. Then 126 minus something to get 81. 126 - 45 = 81. How to get 45 from 5 and 711? 711 divided by 15.8 is about 45, but not helpful. Alternatively, 5 * 9 = 45. But where's the 9? Maybe 711 minus 66 is 645. Then 645 divided by something. 645 divided by 8 is about 80.6, which is close to 81. But 8 isn't a number here. Wait, maybe use 60 and 5 to make 8? 60 divided by 5 is 12. Hmm.\n\nWait, 711 divided by (something) equals 81. Let's see: 81 multiplied by what gives 711? 81*8=648, 81*9=729. So 711 is between 81*8 and 81*9. So maybe 711 divided by 8.777... is 81. But how to get 8.777 from the other numbers. The other numbers are 5, 66, 60. Maybe 60 divided by (5 + 66/66)? No, not sure. Alternatively, 66 divided by something. 66 divided by 7.5 is 8.8. Wait, but 7.5 can be made from 60 divided by 8, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe subtract two numbers. Like 711 - (66 + 60 +5) = 711 - 131 = 580. No, not 81. Alternatively, 66 - 5 = 61. 61 + 60 = 121. 711 - 121 = 590. Still no.\n\nWait, maybe multiply some numbers. 5 * 60 = 300. 711 - 300 = 411. Then subtract 66? 411 -66=345. No.\n\nWhat about 711 - 66 = 645. Then 645 divided by (60 /5) = 645 /12 = 53.75. Not 81.\n\nAlternatively, 60 divided by 5 is 12. Then 66 -12 =54. Then 711 divided by 54 is about 13.166... Not helpful.\n\nWait, what if I use 66 - 60 =6. Then 5 *6=30. Then 711 -30=681. Not 81. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 711 - (66 * something). Let's see, 66*12=792. 711 is less than that. 66*10=660. 711-660=51. Close to 81. 66*9=594. 711-594=117. Still not.\n\nWait, maybe combine division and multiplication. Let's see, if I have 711 divided by something plus or minus another number. For example, 711/ (something) + 5 =81. Then 711/(something) =76. So something is 711/76≈9.355. How to get 9.355 from 66, 60. Maybe 66 -60=6, plus 5=11. Not helpful. Alternatively, 60/66≈0.909. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, 711 divided by 5 is 142.2. Then subtract 60 and 66. 142.2 -60=82.2, minus66=16.2. Not 81.\n\nWait, maybe 66 +60=126. Then 126 - (711/5). 711/5=142.2. 126-142.2= -16.2. No.\n\nAlternatively, (66 +60) - (711 /5) = same as above.\n\nHmm. Maybe think differently. Let's consider 81 as the result. Let's think of possible equations that result in 81. For example: 81 = 9*9, 81= 90-9, 81= 72+9, etc. Can we create 9 from the remaining numbers? Let's see.\n\nIf we use 60 and 5, 60/5=12. Then 12*7=84, but no 7. Alternatively, 66 - (60/5) =66 -12=54. Then 54 + something =81. That something would need to be 27, but how?\n\nAlternatively, 66 -5=61. Then 61 + (something) =81. That something is 20. But 60 divided by 3 is 20, but where's the 3?

Alternatively, 60 -5=55. 645/55≈11.727. Not 81.\n\nAlternatively, 60 - (5* something). 5*12=60. But that's just 60-60=0. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe 711 divided by 60 is about 11.85. Then multiply by 5: 11.85*5=59.25. Then add 66: 59.25+66=125.25. Not 81.\n\nAlternatively, 66 * (60 /5) =66*12=792. Then 792 -711=81. Wait, that's interesting. Let me check: 60 divided by 5 is 12. Then 66 multiplied by 12 is 792. Then subtract 711. 792 -711=81. Yes! But have I used all the numbers? Let me see: 60, 5, 66, 711. Yes. So the equation would be 66*(60/5) - 711 =81.\n\nLet me compute that step by step. First, 60 divided by 5 is 12. Then 66 multiplied by 12 is 792. 792 minus 711 is indeed 81. That works! So the equation is (66 * (60 / 5)) - 711 = 81. Let me verify all numbers are used once: 66, 60, 5, 711. Yes, all used once. Perfect. So that's the solution.\n</think>\n\n<answer>66 * (60 / 5) - 711 = 81</answer>"}]}

Let's see. Hmm, first, I should think about what operations can combine these numbers. Since 371 is a bit large, maybe multiplication or addition is involved. Let me try different combinations.\n\nFirst, let's check the target: 371. Let me see if 467 can be part of this. If I subtract something from 467, maybe. Let's calculate 467 minus something. 467 - 96 = 371. Wait, 96? Do I have numbers that can make 96? Let's see. The numbers left are 65, 3, 34. Can I combine them to get 96? Let's try. 65 + 34 is 99. Then 99 - 3 is 96. Oh! That could work. So 467 - (65 + 34 - 3) = 467 - (99 -3) = 467 -96 = 371. Let me check that: 65 +34 is 99, subtract 3 gives 96, then 467-96 is indeed 371.\n\nWait, but does that use all the numbers? Let's see: 467, 65, 34, 3. Yes, each is used once. So the equation would be 467 - (65 + 34 - 3) = 371. Let me write that properly with parentheses. So (65 +34 -3) is 96, so 467 -96 = 371. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way. Let me check. For example, if I use multiplication. Let's see, 34 * 11 is 374, which is close to 371. But do I have numbers that can make 11? Hmm, 65 divided by something? 65 / 5 is 13. Not helpful. Or 3 + 34 is 37. 467 - 37 is 430, which is not close. Alternatively, 65 * 3 is 195. Then 195 + 34 is 229. 467 -229 is 238. No. Not helpful.\n\nAnother approach: 467 - 65 is 402. Then 402 - 34 is 368. Then 368 +3 is 371. Wait, that's 467 -65 -34 +3. Let's calculate: 467 -65 = 402, 402 -34 = 368, 368 +3 = 371. Yes! That works. So the equation is 467 -65 -34 +3. Let's check if all numbers are used once: 467, 65, 34, 3. Yes. That's correct. So this equation would be 467 -65 -34 +3 = 371.\n\nWhich one is better? The first one uses parentheses with addition and subtraction inside, while the second one is a straightforward left-to-right calculation. Let me verify the second equation step by step:\n\n467 minus 65 is 402. Then 402 minus 34 is 368. Then 368 plus 3 is 371. Yep. So both equations work. But the problem allows any basic operations, so either way is acceptable. However, maybe using parentheses in the first way is more efficient, but the second way is simpler.\n\nWait, but in the second equation, the order of operations would be from left to right since all operations are subtraction and addition. So 467 -65 -34 +3 is evaluated as ((467 -65) -34) +3. That works. So both equations are valid. But the problem requires using each number once and all numbers. So both are valid. The user probably expects either one. Let me check which one uses the operations as per the problem's example. The example shows parentheses, but maybe either is acceptable.\n\nBut perhaps the problem requires using all four numbers and each once. Let me confirm. The first equation uses all four numbers: 467, 65, 34, 3. The second equation also uses all four. Either equation is correct. Wait, but in the first equation, we have 467 - (65 +34 -3). That uses all numbers once. The second equation is 467 -65 -34 +3. Both are correct. So which one to choose?\n\nAlternatively, maybe another combination with multiplication or division. Let's see. 65 * 3 is 195. Then 195 + 34 is 229. 467 -229 is 238. No. 34 * 3 is 102. 467 -102 is 365. Then 365 +65 is 430. Not helpful. 65 divided by 3 is roughly 21.666. Not helpful. 467 divided by 3 is around 155.666. Not helpful. 34 divided by 3 is about 11.333. 467 - (34/3) is 467 -11.333 ≈455.666. Not helpful.\n\nHmm. So the two possible equations are either 467 -65 -34 +3 or 467 - (65 +34 -3). Both result in 371. Since the problem allows using operations multiple times, either is acceptable. Maybe the second one uses parentheses more effectively, but both are correct. Let me check if the problem requires the minimal use of operations or not. The problem just says to use basic operations any number of times, as long as each number is used once. So either equation works. But perhaps the first equation (the one with parentheses) is more efficient. Let me present both and see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe another way. Let me think again. 467 - (65 +34) +3? That's 467 -99 +3 = 467 -96 = 371. Wait, that's the same as the first equation. Because 65 +34 is 99, then subtracting that and adding 3 is equivalent to 99 -3. So 467 - (99 -3) is the same as 467 -99 +3. So both equations are the same, just written differently. So in that case, it's a matter of grouping. So the equation can be written as 467 -65 -34 +3, which is the same as 467 - (65 +34) +3. Both are correct. But when written without parentheses, left-to-right evaluation gives the same result. So the user might accept either form. However, the problem example shows parentheses, so maybe the expected answer uses parentheses. Let me check the example: (1 + 2) / 3. So perhaps the answer should use parentheses even if they're not necessary for order of operations. For example, in the first equation, the parentheses are necessary to group 65 +34 -3. But in the second equation, the left-to-right evaluation works without them. So maybe the first equation is better. Let me confirm.\n\nWait, 467 - (65 +34 -3) is 467 - (96) = 371. Alternatively, 467 -65 -34 +3 is 467 -65=402, 402 -34=368, 368 +3=371. So same result. So either way. But perhaps the answer expects parentheses. The user might prefer one over the other. Let me check if both are acceptable. The problem says \"create an equation that equals 371\", and the example uses parentheses. So perhaps either is fine, but since using parentheses groups the numbers, maybe the first one is better. Let me go with the first equation: 467 - (65 +34 -3) = 371. This uses all numbers once, and the operations are subtraction and addition. Alternatively, perhaps multiplication or division is required. Wait, no, the problem allows any operations. But I didn't need to use multiplication or division here. The problem states \"you can use basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) one or multiple times\", so it's okay to use only subtraction and addition. So both equations are valid. Let me present the one with parentheses as per the example.\n</think>\n\n<answer>467 - (65 + 34 - 3) = 371</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using the numbers 21, 26, 1, and 417, each exactly once, and the result should be 412. Hmm. Let me start by listing out the numbers and the target. The operations allowed are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\nFirst, I should check if there's a way to combine these numbers step by step. Let me consider the largest number, 417. Since 417 is close to 412, maybe subtracting something from 417 would work. 417 minus 5 equals 412. So can I make 5 using the remaining numbers: 21, 26, and 1?\n\nWait, 21, 26, and 1. Let's see. If I subtract 21 from 26, that gives 5. Oh! So 26 - 21 = 5. Then 417 - (26 - 21) would be 417 - 5 = 412. But wait, I still have the 1 left. Oh no, I have to use all the numbers. So that approach uses 417, 26, 21, but leaves out the 1. That won't work. So I need to include all four numbers.\n\nHmm. Let me think again. Maybe there's another way. Let's see, 21, 26, 1, 417. Maybe multiply some numbers. Let's see. 26 times 21 is 546. Then subtract 417 and subtract 1? 546 - 417 = 129, then 129 -1 = 128. Not 412. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 417 divided by something. 417 divided by 1 is 417. Then add 26 minus 21. 26-21=5, 417+5=422. Not 412. Close, but not quite.\n\nWait, what if I do 417 - (26 + 21). That's 417 - 47 = 370. Then use the 1 somehow. 370 *1 = 370. Still not 412. Or 417 - 26 = 391. Then 391 +21 = 412, but then the 1 is left. Hmm, but that would use 417 -26 +21 = 412, but again, the 1 isn't used. So that's a problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 417 - (26 + 21 +1). 26+21+1=48. 417-48=369. Not helpful.\n\nWhat if I do 417 - (21 * something). Let's see. 21 * 1 is 21. 417 -21=396. Then 396 +26=422. Still not 412. Or 417 -21=396, 396 -26=370. No.\n\nWait, maybe division can help. Let's see. If I take 26 divided by 1, that's 26. Then multiply by 21: 21*26=546. Then subtract 546 -417=129. Not 412.\n\nAlternatively, 26 * (21 -1) =26*20=520. Then 520 -417=103. Not 412.\n\nHmm. Let's try another approach. Let's think about 412 and see how it can be formed. 412 is 400 +12, or 420 -8. Let's see. Maybe 21 * 26 is 546. 546 - 417 =129. Then 129 -1=128. Not helpful. Not close.\n\nAlternatively, 417 +21=438. Then 438 -26=412. But then where does the 1 come into play? 438 -26 is 412, but I need to use 1. So maybe 417 + (21 -26) -1. Wait, 21-26= -5. So 417 -5 -1=411. Close, but not quite.\n\nOr 417 + (21 -26) +1. That would be 417 -5 +1=413. Still not 412.\n\nAlternatively, maybe multiply 21 by 1. 21*1=21. Then 417 -21=396. Then 396 +26=422. Still not.\n\nWait, perhaps 417 - (26 * something). 26 * 1=26. 417 -26=391. Then 391 +21=412. But then, again, the 1 is used here, but wait, 26 is multiplied by 1. So 417 - (26 *1) +21. Let me check: 26*1=26, 417-26=391, 391+21=412. Oh! Wait, does that use all numbers? Let's see. 417, 26, 1, and 21. Yes. All four numbers are used once. So the equation would be 417 - (26 * 1) +21 =412. Let me check the arithmetic: 26*1=26. 417-26=391. 391+21=412. Yes! That works. All numbers are used exactly once. So the equation is 417 - 26*1 +21 =412. But how to write it with the correct order of operations. So parentheses might be needed. Let me structure it properly. So (417 - (26 * 1)) +21. But since multiplication comes before subtraction and addition, maybe it's 417 -26*1 +21. But I can also write it as 417 +21 -26*1. Either way, the result is the same. But to make it clear, maybe using parentheses: (417 +21) - (26*1). Let me check: 417+21=438, 26*1=26, 438-26=412. Yes. So (417 +21) - (26*1) =412. That uses all four numbers once each. So that's the equation. Let me double-check: 417+21 is 438. 26*1 is 26. 438-26 is 412. Correct. All numbers are used once. So the equation is (417 + 21) - (26 * 1) = 412.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(417 + 21) - (26 * 1) = 412</answer>"}]}

Each number has to be used exactly once, and I can only use basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Hmm.\n\nFirst, let me list out the numbers: 4, 472, 86, 46. The target is 600. Let's think about the larger numbers first because they might get me closer to 600. The biggest number here is 472. If I can somehow combine 472 with another number to get close to 600, that might work.\n\nSo 600 minus 472 is 128. So if I can make 128 using the remaining numbers: 4, 86, and 46. Wait, but I need to use all numbers. So 4, 86, 46. How can I combine them to get 128? Let's see. 86 plus 46 is 132. That's more than 128. Then subtract 4? 132 -4 is 128. Oh! So that would be 86 + 46 -4 = 128. Then adding that to 472: 472 + 128 = 600. But wait, I have to use all the numbers, so let me check. 472 + (86 +46 -4) = 600. That uses all four numbers: 472,86,46,4. So that works. Let me write that out as an equation: 472 + 86 + 46 -4. Wait, no. Because 86 +46 is 132, then 132 -4 is 128, then 472 +128 is 600. So the equation would be 472 + (86 +46 -4) = 600. But the parentheses are important here. So the equation is 472 + (86 + 46 - 4) = 600. Let me check: 86 +46 is 132. 132 -4 is 128. 472 +128 is 600. Yes, that works. \n\nBut wait, do I need to use all the numbers? Yes: 472,86,46,4. All are used once. So that's the solution. Let me just make sure there's no other way. Another approach: Maybe multiplying some numbers. Let's see. 46 * 4 is 184. 472 is already a big number. 472 + 184 = 656. Then subtract 56 (but I don't have 56, but 86 - something?). Hmm. Alternatively, 86 divided by something. 86 divided by 4 is 21.5. That might complicate things. Alternatively, 472 - something. 472 -86 is 386. Then add 46 and 4: 386 +46=432, +4=436. Not close. \n\nAnother idea: 86 * 6 is 516. Wait, but where would I get 6 from? Maybe 46 -4=42. Not helpful. Maybe 4* something. 4*46=184. Then 472 +184=656. Then 656 -86=570. Not 600. \n\nAlternatively, 472 + 86 = 558. Then 558 +46=604. Then 604 -4=600. Wait, that's another way. So 472 +86 +46 -4 = 600. That's the same as before but without the parentheses. The order of operations here would just be left to right, but addition and subtraction are left associative. So 472 +86 is 558, +46 is 604, -4 is 600. So the equation can be written as 472 +86 +46 -4 =600. That uses all numbers once. Let me check again. 472 +86 is 558. 558 +46 is 604. 604 -4 is 600. Exactly. So that's a valid equation. \n\nI think that's the correct answer. Let me just check if there's any other possible combination. For example, using multiplication or division. Let's see: Maybe 86 * 4 = 344. Then 472 -344 =128. Then 46 + something. Wait, 128 +46=174, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, 46*4=184. 472 +184=656. Then 656 - (86) = 570. Not enough. Maybe 656 - (86 -46). 86-46=40, 656-40=616. Not 600. Alternatively, 86 divided by something. 86/4=21.5, then 472 +21.5=493.5. Then 493.5 +46=539.5. Not 600. \n\nAnother approach: 46 * (4 + something). Let's see. 46*(4 + x) = let's see, 46*13=598, which is close to 600. How to get 13? 4 + (86/ something). 86 divided by 472? No. Wait, 86/ something. Maybe 86 divided by 46 is about 1.869. So 4 + (86/46) ≈4 +1.869≈5.869. Then 46*5.869≈270. Not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, 472 divided by something. 472/4=118. Then 118 * something. 118*5=590. Close to 600. How to get 5? 86-46=40. 40 divided by 8? But I don't have an 8. Maybe (86-46)/something. 40/8=5. But I don't have 8. Wait, but I have 4. 40/4=10. Then 118*10=1180. That's way over. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, 86-4=82. 82* something. 82*7=574. Not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, 472 - (86 +46) = 472 -132=340. Then 340 +4=344. Not 600. \n\nAlternatively, 472 +4=476. 476* something. Let's see, 476*1.26≈600. But how to get 1.26 from 86 and 46. 86/46≈1.869. Not helpful. \n\nSo it seems the only way is the first approach: 472 +86 +46 -4 =600. Let me verify once more. 472+86=558. 558+46=604. 604-4=600. Yep, correct. All numbers used once. So that's the solution.\n</think>\n\n<answer>472 + 86 + 46 - 4 = 600</answer>"}]}

I need to make an equation using the numbers 648, 33, 23, and 97, each exactly once, and the result has to be 495. The operations allowed are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Hmm, where do I start?\n\nFirst, maybe I should look at the target number, 495, and see how it relates to the given numbers. Let's check if any of the numbers can be combined through basic operations to reach 495. \n\nLooking at 648: that's a big number. If I subtract something from it, maybe? 648 - something = 495. Let's see, 648 - 495 is 153. Do I have any combination of the other numbers (33, 23, 97) that can make 153? Let's check. 33 + 23 + 97 = 153? 33 +23 is 56, plus 97 is 153. Oh! Wait, that adds up. So 648 - (33 + 23 + 97) = 648 - 153 = 495. But wait, the problem requires using all numbers exactly once. In this case, if I use 33, 23, and 97 in the subtraction, that's all the numbers except 648. But the problem says I must use all four numbers. So using all of them, each once. So I can't just add three numbers together; I need to use each of the four numbers once in the equation. So maybe that approach doesn't work because I need to use each number once.\n\nSo scratch that idea. Let's think again. Let's see, 495 is a multiple of 5. Let's see if any of the numbers can be divided to get 5. 33 divided by something? 33 divided by 6.6 is 5, but I don't have 6.6. 23 is a prime number. 97 is also prime. 648 divided by something. 648 / 129.6 is 5. Not helpful. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe multiplication. Let's see, 33 times 15 is 495. 15 can be made from other numbers. For example, 23 - 97 + something? Hmm. 23 - 97 is negative, so maybe not. Alternatively, 648 divided by something. Let's see, 648 divided by 43.2 is 15. But I don't have 43.2. Alternatively, 97 - 23 is 74. Not helpful.\n\nWait, 33 multiplied by 15 is 495. How can I get 15 from the remaining numbers: 648, 23, 97. Let's see. 23 + 97 is 120. 648 divided by 120 is 5.4. Not helpful. 648 minus (23 +97) = 648 - 120 = 528. 528 divided by 33 is 16. Not 15. Hmm.\n\nWait, 648 divided by 33 is approximately 19.636. Not helpful. Maybe 648 divided by 97. Let's calculate that. 97 times 6 is 582. 648 -582=66. 66/97 is about 0.68. So 6.68. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe subtract two numbers and multiply by another. Let's see, (648 - 97) = 551. Then 551 - (33 +23)=551-56=495. But again, that uses all four numbers: 648 -97 -33 -23 = 495. Wait, but that's 648 -97 -33 -23. Let me compute that. 648 -97 is 551. 551 -33 is 518. 518 -23 is 495. Yes, that works. So the equation would be 648 - 97 - 33 - 23 = 495. But let me check: all numbers are used once. 648, 97, 33, 23 each subtracted once. That uses all four numbers and each exactly once. So the equation would be 648 - 97 - 33 - 23 = 495. Is that allowed? The problem says you can use the operations one or multiple times. So subtraction is used three times here. But since each number is used once, that seems acceptable. Let me verify the calculation again:\n\n648 minus 97 is 551. Then 551 minus 33 is 518. Then 518 minus 23 is 495. Correct. So this seems to work. But wait, the problem says \"create an equation that equals 495\" using all numbers once with basic operations. So that equation would be 648 - 97 -33 -23 = 495. But maybe the problem expects more complex operations, but according to the instructions, this should be acceptable. However, maybe I need to use different operations, but the problem allows any combination of the basic operations. So this seems like a valid solution. But let me check if there's another way, maybe using multiplication or division, just to be sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps combine some numbers with multiplication or division. For example, 648 divided by something. Let's see 648 / (something) = 495. Then that something would be 648/495 = 1.309... Not sure if that's possible. Alternatively, 33 multiplied by something. 495 divided by 33 is 15. So if I can get 15 from 648, 23, 97. Let's see, 23 - (97 -648). Wait, that's 23 - (97-648) = 23 + 551 = 574, which is not 15. Hmm. Alternatively, 97 - 23 =74. 648 divided by 74 is approximately 8.756. Not 15. 648 divided by 97 is about 6.68, subtract 23: 6.68 -23 is negative. Not helpful. \n\nAnother approach: 648 - (97 * something) = 495. So 97 * something = 648 -495 = 153. So 153 divided by 97 is approximately 1.577. Not an integer. But 33 + 23 =56. 56 times 2.732... Hmm, not helpful. Alternatively, 97 + 23 =120. 120 * something. 120*1.275=153. But that's not helpful. \n\nWait, maybe 33 * 23 = 759. Then 759 - something. 759 -648=111. 111 -97=14. No, not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, 97 * 5 =485. Close to 495. 485 +10=495. How to get 10? 33 -23=10. So 97*5 + (33-23)=495. But do we have a 5? Maybe 648 divided by something. 648 divided by 129.6 is 5. But we don't have 129.6. Alternatively, use other numbers. Let's see, 97*(648/(something)) + (33-23). Not sure. This seems complicated. \n\nAlternatively, 648 divided by something. Let's see, 648 / (33 - something). If I take 33 -23=10, then 648/10=64.8. 64.8 +97=161.8. Not 495. \n\nHmm. Alternatively, 23 * 97 = 2231. That's way too big. 648 -2231 is negative. Not helpful. \n\nWait, let's think again about the first solution: 648 -97 -33 -23=495. That uses all numbers once and only subtraction operations. But according to the problem statement, that's allowed. So maybe that's the answer. Let me check if there's any possible other way, but this seems straightforward. Let me verify once again:\n\n648 -97=551\n\n551-33=518\n\n518-23=495.\n\nYes, that works. So the equation is 648 - 97 - 33 - 23 = 495. Therefore, the answer is (648 - 97 - 33 - 23) = 495. But since the problem says \"create an equation that equals 495\", and we need to use each number exactly once, this equation does that. So the answer should be in that form.\n</think>\n\n<answer>648 - 97 - 33 - 23 = 495</answer>"}]}

Hmm. Let's start by thinking about the target number, 290. Maybe breaking it down into factors or seeing how close the given numbers can get me.\n\nFirst, the largest number here is 58. If I can multiply that by something to get close to 290. Let's check: 58 * 5 = 290. Oh, wait! That's exactly the target. But wait, if I use 58 and 5, then I have to use 1 and 25 as well. So just 58*5 would only use two numbers, but I need to use all four. So that approach alone won't work. Maybe I can combine the other numbers in a way that modifies this product.\n\nAlternatively, maybe subtract or add something. Let's see: 58 * 5 is 290. So if I have 58 * 5 + (something with 25 and 1) but since 58*5 already gives 290, adding anything would overshoot. But maybe subtract? Wait, but 58*5 is exactly 290. So perhaps there's a way to involve 25 and 1 into a part that cancels out? Like 58*5 + (25 -25) but that would require reusing numbers. No, we can't do that. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to combine some numbers before multiplying. Let's see. For example, 25 is a big number. If I do 25 multiplied by something. Let's think: 25 * 11.6 would be 290, but how to get 11.6 from 1, 5, 58? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe 58 is part of an addition or subtraction. Let's think differently.\n\nWait, maybe use division. Let's see: 290 divided by 58 is 5. So that brings back to the earlier idea. But again, how to involve 1 and 25. Alternatively, maybe (58 - something) multiplied by something else. Let's try that.\n\nSuppose I do (58 - 1) = 57. Then 57 * 5 = 285, which is 5 less than 290. Then maybe add 5, but that uses 5 again. Alternatively, 57 * 5 + 25 = 285 +25=310, which is too much. Hmm.\n\nWhat if I do 58 * (5 + something). Let's see: 58*(5 + x) =290. Then 5 + x = 5, so x=0. But how to get 0 from 1 and 25. Maybe 25-25, but that uses 25 twice. No.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 25* something. Let's see 25*11.6=290. But again, getting 11.6 is tricky. Alternatively, maybe (58 + something) *5. Wait, 58+ something would need to be 58 to get 58*5=290, but again how to use the other numbers.\n\nWait, perhaps combining 25 and 1 to make 26 or 24. Then 26*11.15... Not helpful. Alternatively, subtract: 25 -1 =24. Then 24* something. 24*12.083... Not helpful. Hmm.\n\nWhat if I use division. For example, 58 / something. 58 divided by 0.2 is 290. But how to get 0.2 from 1,5,25. 1/5=0.2. So 58 / (1/5) = 290. Then that would use 58, 1,5. But leaves out 25. So that's not allowed. Need to use all four numbers.\n\nSo maybe 58 divided by (1/5) equals 290, but then where does 25 come in? Maybe 25 is used in another operation. Wait, but then how? For example, 58/(1/5) +25 -25 =290, but that uses 25 twice. Not allowed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 25 * (something) + something else. Let's see. 25*11=275. 275 +15=290. But 15 can be 5*3. But how to get 3 from remaining numbers. If I have 58 and 1 left, maybe 58/ (something) gives 3. Wait, 58 divided by 19.(3) is 3, which seems not helpful. Alternatively, 58-55=3, but that uses 5 and 5 again. No.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 5*58 =290. Then how to use 25 and 1. If I can do 5*(58 + something) - something. Wait, but 58 is already in there. For example, 5*(58 + (25/1)) would be 5*(58+25)=5*83=415, which is way over. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe subtract something. 5*58 - (25/1) =290 -25=265. No. Not enough. Alternatively, 5*58 + (25/1)=290 +25=315. Hmm. Not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps reverse the operations. Let's think about 25. 25*11.6=290. So 25*(58/5 +1) ? Let's see: 58/5 is 11.6, plus 1 is 12.6. 25*12.6=315. Not 290. Alternatively, 25*(58/5 -1) =25*(11.6 -1)=25*10.6=265. No.\n\nAlternatively, 58*(5) =290. Then need to involve 25 and 1. Maybe 58*5 + (25 -25)*1, but that uses 25 twice and 1. Not allowed. Alternatively, maybe 58*5 +25-25*1. But again, 25 is used twice. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe using subtraction and division. Let's try: 58*5 - (25 -1). Let's compute that: 290 -24=266. Not 290. No. Alternatively, 58*5 + (25 -1)=290+24=314. No.\n\nWhat if I multiply 25 and 1 to get 25, but that doesn't help. Then 25*1=25. So then maybe 58*5 +25*1=290 +25=315. No. Still not.\n\nAlternatively, 58*(5 +1) =58*6=348. Then subtract 25* something. 348 - 58=290. But that uses 58 again. No.\n\nWait, maybe (25* (5 +1)) +58. Let's compute that: 25*6=150 +58=208. Not 290.\n\nAlternatively, 25*5=125. Then 125 +58 +1=184. No. Not enough.\n\nHmm. This is tricky. Let's think differently. Maybe combining 25 and 5 first. For example, 25 -5=20. Then 20* something. 20*14.5=290. How to get 14.5 from 58 and 1. 58 divided by 4 is 14.5, but 4 is not available. Alternatively, 58 -1=57. 57 divided by something. Not helpful.\n\nWait, another angle: 290 can be written as 58*5. But since we need to use 25 and 1, perhaps we can create 5 from 25 and 1, but that would use up those numbers. Let's see: 25/5=5, but that uses 25 and 5. Then 58* (25/5) *1=58*5*1=290. But does this use all numbers? Let's check: 25,5,58,1. Yes. So 58 multiplied by (25 divided by 5) multiplied by 1. That works. Because 25 divided by 5 is 5, then 58*5*1=290. So the equation would be 58*(25/5)*1=290. But let's check if all numbers are used once: 58,25,5,1. Yes. So that's a valid equation. \n\nWait, but let me confirm: 25/5 is 5, then 58*5=290, and then multiply by 1, which is still 290. So yes, the equation uses all four numbers exactly once. So this would be 58 * (25 / 5) * 1 = 290. But in this case, we can also write it without the multiplication by 1, but since we have to use all numbers, including 1, we need to include it. Alternatively, perhaps arrange it as (25/5) *58 +1 -1, but that uses 1 twice. So no, better to multiply by 1. So the equation is 58 * (25 / 5) * 1 = 290. Let me check the arithmetic: 25 divided by 5 is 5. Then 5 multiplied by 58 is 290. Then multiplied by 1 stays 290. So yes, that works. \n\nAlternatively, if parentheses are allowed, maybe 58 * (25 / 5 + 1) but that would be 58*(5+1)=58*6=348. Not 290. So no. Alternatively, 58*(25 -5)/1. That would be 58*20=1160. No. \n\nSo the correct equation is 58 * (25 / 5) * 1 = 290. Using all numbers once. Let me verify again: 25 divided by 5 is 5, then 58*5=290, multiplied by 1 gives 290. Yes. So all numbers 58,25,5,1 are used once. That should be the answer.\n</think>\n\n<answer>58 * (25 / 5) * 1 = 290</answer>"}]}

Hmm. Let's start by thinking about what operations can lead to larger numbers. Since 888 is a pretty big number, multiplication might be necessary. Let me see.\n\nFirst, let's list the numbers: 77, 745, 14, 80. The largest number here is 745, so maybe that's a starting point. If I can subtract or add something to 745 to get close to 888. Let's check the difference: 888 - 745 = 143. So if I can make 143 from 77, 14, and 80, that might work. But I need to use all numbers. Wait, but 77, 14, and 80 would be three numbers, but we already used 745. So that might be possible. Let's see.\n\n143 can be made from 77, 14, 80. Let me think. 80 + 77 = 157. That's too much. 80 + 14 = 94. 77 + 14 = 91. Hmm. Maybe subtract? 80 - 14 = 66. Then 66 + 77 = 143. Yes! So 80 - 14 = 66, then 66 + 77 = 143. Then 745 + 143 = 888. But how do I combine these operations into one equation using all numbers once?\n\nWait, but 745 + (80 -14 +77) would be 745 + 143 = 888. But how to structure that using each number once. Let me check:\n\n745 + (80 - 14) +77? But that would be adding 77 again, but we can't because each number can only be used once. Wait, no, the 80, 14, and 77 are all separate. Wait, but the original numbers are 77,745,14,80. If I do 745 + (80 -14) +77, that would indeed use all four numbers once. Let's compute that: 80-14=66, 66+77=143, 745+143=888. So the equation would be 745 + (80 -14) +77 = 888. But wait, the problem says to use each number once and all numbers. So that works. Let me check the arithmetic:\n\n80 -14 = 66; 66 +77=143; 745 +143=888. Yes, correct. So the equation is 745 + 77 + (80 -14) = 888. But since we need to use all numbers once and the operations. Let's make sure. The numbers used are 745,77,80,14. Each once. The operations are subtraction and addition. So that's allowed.\n\nBut wait, the problem allows using operations multiple times but each number once. So the equation would be 745 + 77 + 80 -14 =888. Let me calculate that:\n\n745 +77 = 822; 822 +80 = 902; 902 -14=888. Yes, that works. So the equation is (745 + 77) + (80 -14) =888, but written as 745 +77 +80 -14 =888. But since all numbers are used once, and each operation is allowed. Let me check if parentheses are necessary for the order. Addition and subtraction are left associative, so 745 +77 is 822, then +80 is 902, then -14 is 888. So the equation without parentheses is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe another combination with multiplication. Let's think if there's another way. For example, 77 multiplied by something. 888 divided by 77 is approximately 11.53, which isn't an integer. Maybe not. What about 80 * 11.1? Hmm, 80*11=880, which is close. Then 880 +8=888. How to get 8 from 14 and 77 and 745? Not sure. Alternatively, 80 * (something) to get 888. Let's see: 888 /80=11.1. So 11.1*80=888. Can I make 11.1 from 77,745,14? That seems tricky. Alternatively, maybe 745 - 77 = 668. Then 668 * something? 668 *1.33=888. Not sure. Hmm. Alternatively, 745 - (something) = 888. But 745 is less than 888, so we need to add. Wait, but that's the previous approach.\n\nAlternatively, 80*14=1120. Then 1120 - something=888. 1120 -888=232. So need to get 232 from 745 and 77. Hmm. 745-77=668. 668 is way bigger than 232. Not helpful. Maybe 745 divided by something? 745/3.22≈232. Not helpful. Maybe 745 - (77*3)=745-231=514. Still not 232. Not helpful.\n\nAnother idea: 14*80=1120. Then 1120 - (745 -77)=1120 -668=452. Not 888. Hmm. Alternatively, 745 -80=665. Then 665 +77=742. Then 742 +14=756. Not close. Alternatively, 77*14=1078. 1078 - something=888. 1078-888=190. So need 190 from 745 and 80. 745-80=665. Not helpful. 745/80≈9.3. Not helpful. Maybe 745 - (80* something)=190. 745-80x=190 → 80x=555 → x=6.9375. Not an integer.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about division. Maybe dividing some of the larger numbers. 745 divided by something. For example, 745/14≈53.2. Then 53.2 * something. Hmm. Maybe 80 +77=157. 157* something. 157*5.65≈888. Not helpful. Alternatively, 745/80=9.3125. Then multiply by 14*77? That seems way too big.\n\nAlternatively, maybe combine multiplication and addition. Let's see: 77*14=1078. Then 1078 + something - something. But we have to use 745 and 80. So 1078 +80 -745=1078+80=1158-745=413. Not 888.\n\nAlternatively, 77* (something). Let's say 77*11=847. 847 +41=888. How to get 41 from 745,14,80. Maybe 80 - (745/14). Wait, 745 divided by 14 is about 53.21. 80 -53.21≈26.79. Not 41. Alternatively, 80 -14=66. 66 - (745/77). 745/77≈9.67. 66-9.67≈56.33. Not helpful.\n\nHmm. Maybe the first approach is the best. Let's confirm again: 745 +77 +80 -14. Let's compute step by step:\n\n745 +77 = 822.\n\n822 +80 = 902.\n\n902 -14 = 888.\n\nYes, that works. So the equation is 745 + 77 + 80 -14 =888. All numbers are used once, and operations are all additions and subtractions. That should be acceptable. Let me check if there's any other possible way, but maybe this is the simplest. Let me see another possibility just in case.\n\nAnother approach: 80 * 14 = 1120. Then 1120 - 745 = 375. Then 375 +77 =452. Not 888. No.\n\nAlternatively, 745 -14=731. Then 731 +80=811. 811 +77=888. Wait, 745-14=731; 731+80=811; 811+77=888. That works! Let me check that.\n\n745 -14 =731.\n\n731 +80=811.\n\n811 +77=888.\n\nYes! So the equation is 745 -14 +80 +77 =888. Let's see: 745-14 is 731, plus 80 is 811, plus 77 is 888. All numbers used once. Operations are subtraction and additions. That's valid. So this is another valid equation. So there are two possibilities here: either 745 +77 +80 -14, or 745 -14 +80 +77. Both are essentially the same, just the order of operations. Since addition is commutative, the order doesn't matter. So either equation would work.\n\nBut maybe the problem expects a specific arrangement. Let me check the arithmetic again:\n\nFirst equation: 745 +77 +80 -14.\n\nSecond equation:745 -14 +80 +77.\n\nEither way, the result is 888. So both are correct. So the answer can be either of those. Since the problem allows using operations multiple times, and each number once, either way is fine. So I can present either as the solution.\n</think>\n\n<answer>745 + 77 + 80 - 14 = 888</answer>"}]}

I need to use all the numbers 32, 34, 88, and 42 exactly once each with basic arithmetic operations to get 196. Hmm, where to start. Let me think about the target number first. 196 is a bit over double 88, which is one of the numbers here. But 88 is a big number, so maybe I can use it as part of a multiplication or division.\n\nWait, 196 divided by 88 is approximately 2.227, which doesn't seem helpful. Alternatively, maybe subtract something from 88 to get close. 88 times 2 is 176, which is less than 196. 176 plus 20 is 196. Do I have a 20? Well, maybe from 34 minus 14, but 14 isn't directly here. Alternatively, 32 plus 34 is 66. Then 88 plus 66 is 154, which is still lower than 196. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe combine 42 and 34. 42 minus 34 is 8. If I can use that 8 with 32 and 88. Like 88 plus 32 is 120, then 120 times 8 would be 960, way too big. Not helpful.\n\nWhat if I multiply some numbers. Let's see, 32 * 34 = 1088. Then 1088 divided by something. 1088 divided by 42 is about 25.9, not helpful. 88 divided by 42 is about 2.095. Not sure.\n\nWait, 196 is 14 squared. Maybe looking for squares? But the numbers given are 32,34,88,42. Maybe 42 divided by something? 42 / 3 is 14, but 3 isn't here. 34 - 32 is 2. Then 42 / 2 is 21. Then 88 + 21 is 109. Not 196.\n\nAlternatively, 88 - 34 = 54. Then 54 * 42 = 2268, which divided by 32 is 70.875. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe 88 + 42 = 130. Then 130 plus something. 32 and 34 left. 32 + 34 = 66. 130 + 66 = 196. Wait, that adds up! Let me check:\n\n88 + 42 = 130\n\n32 + 34 = 66\n\n130 + 66 = 196. Oh! That's it! But wait, I need to use all four numbers with each used once. So if I just add them all together: 88 + 42 + 32 + 34. Let me compute that. 88+42 is 130, 32+34 is 66. 130+66 is 196. So the equation is simply 88 + 42 + 32 + 34 = 196. But I have to use each number once, and that's exactly what this does. All operations are additions, each number used once. That works!\n\nWait, but the problem says \"create an equation that equals 196\" using each number once with basic operations. So adding all of them is allowed. Let me verify the sum:\n\n88 + 42 is 130. Then 32 + 34 is 66. 130 + 66 is indeed 196. So the equation is 88 + 42 + 32 + 34 = 196. But I need to present it with the operations used. So since it's all addition, the equation can be written as (88 + 42) + (32 + 34) = 196, or just 88 + 42 + 32 + 34. Either way, as long as all numbers are used once and the result is 196. That should work. But let me check if there's any other way, just in case. Maybe a different combination with subtraction or division.\n\nAlternatively, 88 * 2 is 176. 176 + 20 is 196. How to get 20 from 34, 32, and 42. Wait, 34 - (42 - 32) = 34 - 10 = 24. Not 20. Alternatively, 42 - 32 = 10. Then 34 - 10 = 24. Still not 20. Hmm. Maybe 32 - (42/34) but that's not an integer and might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, 88 * (something) to get close. 88 * 2 = 176. 196 -176=20. So if I can get 20 from 34, 42, 32. Let's see: 42 - 34 = 8. 32 - 8 = 24. Not 20. 34 - (42 -32) =34 -10=24. Not 20. Alternatively, 32 +34=66. 66 -42=24. Again, 24. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 88 + 34=122. Then 122 + something. 32 and 42 left. 32 +42=74. 122 +74=196. Wait, that's the same as before. So 88+34=122, 32+42=74, 122+74=196. So that's another way. But the equation would be 88 +34 +32 +42=196, which is the same sum. So regardless of the grouping, the total sum is the same.\n\nSo the answer is simply adding all four numbers together. Since all numbers are used once and only addition is required. That's the simplest solution. Let me double-check: 88+42=130, 32+34=66; 130+66=196. Yes. Perfect.

All numbers must be used exactly once, and I can only use basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Hmm, this seems challenging but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the target number, 901. Let's see what numbers we have. The largest number here is 765. Maybe if I can subtract or add something to 765 to get close to 901. Let's check the difference: 901 - 765 = 136. So if I can make 136 with the remaining numbers 87, 8, and 41, then adding that to 765 would work. Alternatively, maybe 765 plus something else.\n\nWait, let's list the numbers again: 87, 8, 765, 41. All must be used. Let's see. 765 is a big number. Let me see possible combinations. Let's try 765 + something. Let's try adding 87 to 765: 765 +87 = 852. Then 901 -852=49. So I need 49 from 8 and 41. Hmm, 41 +8=49. So that's possible. Wait, but then the equation would be 765 +87 +41 +8, but that would be 765+87=852, 852+41=893, 893+8=901. But that's just adding all the numbers together. Wait, does that work? Let me check: 765 + 87 is 852, plus 41 is 893, plus 8 is 901. But wait, that's just using all numbers with addition. But the problem states that you can use the operations one or multiple times. So maybe that's allowed. But wait, the user didn't mention that you have to combine them with operations other than just adding all. Let me check the original problem again. It says \"create an equation that equals 901. You can use basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) one or multiple times but each number can only be used once, and you must use all the numbers.\" So adding all of them is allowed. But wait, let me verify the sum: 765 + 87 is 852. Then 852 +41 is 893. 893 +8 is 901. Yes, that's correct. But that seems too straightforward. Maybe the problem expects that you need to use operations more creatively, but perhaps this is acceptable. Let me check if that's allowed. The problem says you can use the operations one or multiple times. So if you just add them all, that's using addition multiple times. Each number is used once. So maybe that's the answer. Wait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me check if adding them all up actually works. Let me sum all the numbers:\n\n765 +87 = 852\n\n852 +41 = 893\n\n893 +8 = 901.\n\nYes, exactly. So the equation would be 765 + 87 + 41 + 8 = 901. But wait, does the order matter here? Let me see. The numbers are 765, 87, 41, 8. If I arrange them in any order with addition, the result is the same. So the equation is valid. However, maybe the problem expects using different operations. Let me check if that's allowed. The problem says \"you can use basic arithmetic operations... one or multiple times but each number can only be used once.\" So adding all the numbers together is acceptable. But maybe the user expects a more complex equation, but according to the problem statement, this should be valid. However, perhaps there's a trick or maybe the numbers can't be just added directly. Wait, but adding them all does use each number once and all of them. Let me confirm again. The sum is indeed 765 +87 +41 +8 = 901. So that's the equation. Hmm, maybe that's the answer. But let me think again to make sure I'm not missing a possible multiplication or division that could help. Maybe the problem is designed to require more than just addition. Let's check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using multiplication. Let's see. Let's take 765 and 8. 765 divided by 8 is about 95.625. Not helpful. 765 multiplied by 8 is 6120, which is way too big. 87 times 41 is 3567, which is also way too big. 87 divided by 8 is about 10.875. Hmm. Let's see. Suppose we do 765 + (something). Let's say 765 + (87 - 8) * something. Wait, 87 -8 is 79. 79 * 41 is 3239, which is way too big. Not helpful. Alternatively, 765 + (41 * 8) = 765 + 328 = 1093, which is over. 765 - (41 *8) = 765 - 328 = 437, which is too low. What if we do 765 + 87 = 852. Then 852 - something =901. Wait, that's not possible because 852 is less than 901. So subtraction would make it smaller. So that's not helpful. Alternatively, 765 * something. Let's see. If we take 765 * (something) and then add or subtract others. Let's say 765 * 1. Let's not. How about (87 + 41) =128. Then 128 * 8 =1024. 1024 -765=259. Not helpful. Alternatively, 87 * 8 = 696. 696 +765=1461, which is way over. Maybe 765 + (41 * 8) +87. Let's compute: 41*8=328. 765+328=1093. 1093+87=1180. Too big. Hmm. Alternatively, 765 + 87 * (something). Let's say 87* (8 +41). 8+41=49. 87*49=4263. 765 +4263=5028. Way too big. Not helpful. \n\nWhat if we use division? Let's see. Suppose I do 765 + (87 / something) * something. Wait, but division might help. For example, maybe (765 + 87) + (41 -8). Let's see: 765+87=852. 41-8=33. 852+33=885. Not enough. Alternatively, 765 + (87 * (41 -8)). 41-8=33. 87*33=2871. 765+2871=3636. No. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 41 * (8 + something) + 765. Let's see: 8 +87=95. 41*95=3895. 3895 +765=4660. No. \n\nWait, maybe 87 * 8 = 696. 696 +765=1461. Then 1461 -41=1420. Still way over. \n\nAlternatively, 765 - (something) to get close to 901. 765 is 136 less than 901. So if I can get 136 from 87, 8, 41. Let's see. 87 +41 =128. 128 +8=136. So 765 + (87 +41 +8) =765+136=901. Wait, that's the same as adding all numbers. Because 87 +41 +8 is 136, so 765 +136=901. So the equation is 765 +87 +41 +8=901. So that's the same as adding all four numbers. Therefore, this is the correct equation. \n\nBut I need to make sure that all numbers are used exactly once and all operations are allowed. Since addition is allowed multiple times, and each number is used once, this should be correct. \n\nBut perhaps the problem expects a different arrangement, but according to the instructions, this is acceptable. Let me check the sum again: 765 +87 is 852, plus 41 is 893, plus8 is 901. Exactly. So the equation is 765 + 87 + 41 + 8 =901. So that's the answer. \n\nBut wait, the problem might require using at least one multiplication or division. But the problem statement doesn't say that. It just says you can use the operations as needed. So maybe this is acceptable. Let me confirm once again. The problem says: \"You can use basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) one or multiple times but each number can only be used once, and you must use all the numbers.\" So using only addition is allowed. So the answer is simply adding all the numbers. Therefore, the equation is 765 +87 +41 +8=901. \n\nBut maybe the problem is designed in a way that this isn't possible, but according to the numbers, it works. Let me check again:\n\n765 +87 = 852\n\n852 +41 = 893\n\n893 +8 = 901\n\nYes. So that's correct. Therefore, the equation is valid.\n</think>\n\n<answer>765 + 87 + 41 + 8 = 901</answer>"}]}

Let me start by thinking about how these numbers can interact.\n\nFirst, let's look at the target number: 772. That's a pretty large number. The numbers I have to work with are 46, 8, 56, and 278. The largest among these is 278. Maybe I can multiply 278 by something to get close to 772. Let's see: 278 times 2 is 556, which is less than 772. 278 times 3 is 834, which is more than 772. Hmm, so maybe 278*2.777... would get me to 772, but I can only use integers and the given numbers. Alternatively, perhaps adding or subtracting other numbers after multiplying.\n\nWait, 278*2 is 556. Then 556 + 216 would be 772. Do I have a way to get 216 from the remaining numbers? Let's see. The remaining numbers are 46, 8, and 56. Let's see: 56 - 46 = 10, 10 + 8 = 18. Not 216. Alternatively, 56*4 is 224, but we don't have a 4. But 46* something. 46*5 is 230. 46*4.7 is around 216, but again, fractions. Hmm. Maybe multiply 56 by 8? 56*8 is 448. Then 278*2 would be 556. 556 + 448 = 1004, which is way over. Wait, but maybe combining differently.\n\nWait, 46*8 is 368. If I take 278 + 368, that's 646. Then 646 + 56 is 702. Still not 772. Hmm. Alternatively, 278*2 is 556, then 56*8 is 448. 556 + 448 = 1004. That's too big. Maybe subtract something instead. 278*3 is 834, but we don't have a 3. Alternatively, maybe using division to get a higher number. For example, 56 divided by 8 is 7. Then 278*7 would be 1946, which is way over. But then maybe subtract 46? 1946 -46=1900. No, not helpful.\n\nWait, let's try a different approach. Let's look at 772 and see if it's divisible by any of the numbers here. 772 divided by 278 is approximately 2.777, which isn't an integer. 772 divided by 56 is about 13.785. Divided by 46 is about 16.782. Divided by 8 is 96.5. None of these seem helpful. So maybe addition and subtraction are the way to go.\n\nWait, maybe start with 278. If I add 56 to 278, that's 334. Then 334 + 46 = 380. 380 +8=388. Not enough. Alternatively, 278 + 46 = 324. Then 324 * something. 324*2 is 648. If I have 56 and 8 left, 56*8=448. 648 +448=1096. Hmm. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe subtract. Let's think: 278* something. Let's see, 56 and 8 could be combined as 56 -8=48. Then 46*48=2208. Then 2208 -278=1930. Not helpful. Alternatively, 278 -56=222. 222* something. 222*3 is 666. 666 +46=712, then +8=720. Not 772.\n\nAlternatively, let's try to multiply two numbers. For example, 46*8=368. Then 56*278=15568. That's way too big. 368 +56=424. 424 +278=702. Then 702 +8=710. Not 772.\n\nWait, maybe use division. Let's think: 278 divided by something. 278/8=34.75. Then 34.75*46=1598.5, which is way over. Not helpful. Or 56/8=7. Then 7*46=322. 322 +278=600. Still not enough. 600 + something? But we used all numbers except maybe 7, but 7 isn't a given number. Wait, 56 divided by 8 is 7, so that uses 56 and 8. Then 7*46=322. 322 +278=600. But we've used 56,8,46,278. All numbers. But 600 is not 772. Hmm.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe 278*2 + something. But where do I get the 2? Since I need to use 8, 46, 56. Wait, if I can make 2 from 8 and another number. Like 8 divided by (56 -46)=8/10=0.8. Not helpful. Or 46 - (56/8)=46-7=39. Then 278*39 is way too big. Alternatively, 56/(8) =7. Then 46*7=322. 322 +278=600. Again, same as before.\n\nWait, maybe 56*46=2576. Then 2576 divided by something. 2576 /8=322. 322 +278=600. Still not 772. Alternatively, 2576 -278=2298. 2298/8=287.25. Not helpful.\n\nHmm. Maybe we need to use subtraction. Let's try 278* (56 -8) =278*48=13344. Then 13344 -46=13298. No, way too big. Alternatively, 278*(56/8)=278*7=1946. 1946 -46=1900. Still not.\n\nWait, perhaps using 278 as a base and then adding products of other numbers. Let's see: 278 + (46*8) =278 +368=646. Then 646 +56=702. Still 70 short. How to get 70 from the remaining numbers? But we already used all numbers except maybe none. Wait, in this case, I used 278,46,8, and 56. All numbers. But 278+368=646 +56=702. So that's 702. Not enough.\n\nWhat if we do 278* (8) =2224. Then 2224 -56=2168. Then 2168 -46=2122. No. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 56* (278 -8) =56*270=15120. Then 15120 /46=328.7... Not an integer. Doesn't help.\n\nHmm. Maybe combine 46 and 56 first. 46+56=102. Then 102*8=816. 816 +278=1094. Too big. 816 -278=538. Not helpful.\n\nWait, 278 +56=334. 334*2=668. How to get 2 from 8 and 46. 8/ (46- something). Wait, 46- (something). If I use 8 to make 2, like 8 divided by 4. But where do I get 4? From 56 maybe? 56 divided by 14=4. But that's using 56 again. Wait, but all numbers must be used once. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, 46 - (56/8) =46 -7=39. Then 278*39=10842. Then subtract 8? 10842 -8=10834. Not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps 278 + (56*8) =278 +448=726. Then 726 +46=772. Oh! Wait, that's 278 + (56*8) +46 = 278 +448 +46. Let's check: 56*8=448. Then 448 +278=726. Then 726 +46=772. That uses all numbers: 56,8,278,46. Yes! Let me check the arithmetic:\n\n56 *8 = 448\n\n448 +278 = 726\n\n726 +46 = 772\n\nYes, that works. All numbers used once, and the operations are multiplication and addition.\n\nSo the equation is 56 *8 +278 +46 =772. But according to the problem statement, we can only use each number once. Let me confirm. The numbers used are 56,8,278,46. Each is used once. Yes. So the equation is (56 * 8) + 278 + 46 = 772. Alternatively, written with proper parentheses if necessary. But since multiplication has higher precedence, it can be written as 56*8 +278 +46 =772. Which is correct.\n</think>\n\n<answer>56 * 8 + 278 + 46 = 772</answer>"}]}

If I subtract something from 744, maybe that would get me closer. What's 744 minus some combination of the other numbers equals 770? Wait, 744 is less than 770, so subtraction would make it even smaller. Maybe addition then. Let's see, 744 plus something. Let me check 744 + 67 = 811, which is over 770. Then I need to subtract the remaining numbers. 811 minus 48 minus 45? Let's calculate that: 811 - 48 = 763, then 763 - 45 = 718. That's way too low. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe multiply some numbers. Let's see. 67 times 45 is 3015. That's way too big. 48 times 45 is 2160. Still too big. Maybe divide. 744 divided by something. 744 / 48 is 15.5. Hmm. Not sure. Let me think of combining operations. What if I take 67 and 48. 67 + 48 = 115. Then 115 * 6.7... but I need integers. Maybe 45 and 67. 45 +67=112. 112 * something. 112*7=784. Close to 770. But how to get 7 from the remaining numbers? 744 and 48. 744 divided by 48 is 15.5. Not helpful. Alternatively, 744 - (something) = 770. Wait, 744 is less than 770, so to get 770 from 744, you have to add. 744 + x =770. So x needs to be 26. How can I get 26 from 67, 48, 45? Let's see: 67 - 48 =19. 19 +45=64. No. 45 - (67-48)=45-19=26. Wait, 45 - (67 -48) is 45 -19=26. So that would be 744 + (45 - (67 -48))=744 +26=770. Let's check: 67 -48 is 19, 45-19 is 26, 744+26 is 770. But wait, did I use all the numbers? Let's see: 744, 67, 48, 45. Yes, each is used once. So the equation would be 744 + (45 - (67 -48)) =770.

I need to create an equation using the numbers 1, 7, 96, and 41, each exactly once, with basic operations to get 385. Hmm. Let's start by thinking about what operations might get me close to 385. \n\nFirst, 385 is a bit over 300, so maybe multiplying some of the larger numbers. Let's see, the largest numbers here are 96 and 41. If I multiply those, 96*41. Let me calculate that. 96*40 is 3840, and then plus 96 is 3936. That's way too big. Hmm, maybe that's not the way.\n\nWait, 41 times something else. Let's see, 41 times 9 is 369, which is close to 385. But 9 isn't one of the numbers. But maybe using 7 and 96 to make 9.5 or something. Wait, but I have to use all numbers exactly once.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 96 divided by something. Let's see, 96 divided by 1 is still 96. Then 96*41 is 3936, which is too big. But maybe subtract or add something. Wait, but I need to use all numbers. So maybe 96*(41 - 7) /1? Let's check: 41-7=34, 34*96=3264, which is way over. Not helpful.\n\nWait, 7*41 is 287. Then if I can add 96 and 1. Let's see, 287 + 96 is 383, plus 1 is 384. Close, but not 385. Hmm. So that's 7*41 +96 +1= 384. So one off. Maybe that's not the way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 7*55=385. How to get 55 from the remaining numbers? We have 1,96,41. Hmm. 96 -41=55. Oh! Wait, 7*(96 -41) +1? Let's check: 96-41=55, 55*7=385, then plus 1 is 386. That's over. But if I subtract 1 instead: 7*(96-41) -1=385-1=384. Not there yet.\n\nWait, maybe 7*(96 -41 +1). Let's see: 96-41=55, plus 1 is 56. 7*56=392. Then subtract 7? No, but I already used 7. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 96* (7 -1) +41. Let's calculate: 7-1=6, 96*6=576, plus 41=617. Too big. Not helpful.\n\nWait, 41*9=369. If I can get 9 from 96 and 7 and 1. Let's see: 96/ (7 +1) =12. So 41*12=492. Then maybe subtract 7* something. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, 41*(7 + something). Let's see, 7+1=8. 41*8=328. Then add 96? 328+96=424. Not 385.\n\nWait, 385 divided by 7 is 55. So if I can get 55 from the other numbers. 96-41=55. So 7*(96-41)=385. Then where does 1 come into play? Oh, wait, the problem says all numbers must be used. So I have to use 1, 7,96,41. So 7*(96-41)=385, but then where is the 1? Maybe add 1-1? But that uses 1 twice. No, can't do that.\n\nWait, maybe subtract 1 and add 1 in a way that cancels. But I can only use each once. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe 7*(96 -41 +1). Let's compute that: 96-41=55, +1=56. 7*56=392. Then 392 -7=385? But I already used 7. Hmm. Not allowed.\n\nWait, perhaps using division. Let's see, 96/1=96. Then 96*41=3936. Then subtract 7* something. Wait, 3936-7* something =385. So 3936 -7x=385 → 7x=3936-385=3551. 3551/7 is about 507.28, which is not an integer. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 41* (96/(7-1)). Let's compute denominator:7-1=6. 96/6=16. Then 41*16=656. That's too big.\n\nAlternatively, (96 +41) * something. 96+41=137. 137*3=411. Not helpful. 137*2.8=383.6. Close, but not exact. How to get that multiplier?\n\nWait, maybe (7 * 41) + (96 /1). Let's see: 7*41=287, 96/1=96. 287+96=383. Plus 1 would be 384, but we have to use all numbers. So 7*41 +96 +1=383+1=384. Still missing by 1. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, 7*41 +96 -1=287+96=383-1=382. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe (96 -7) * (41 -1). Let's compute that: 96-7=89, 41-1=40. 89*40=3560. Way over.\n\nHmm. Maybe using division in a clever way. Let's think. Suppose I take 96 and 41. 96/41 is roughly 2.34. Not sure. 41/96 is about 0.427. Maybe combine that with others.\n\nWait, 385 is 5*77. Or 5*7*11. Not sure if that helps. Let me think differently.\n\nLet me consider the target number 385. The prime factors of 385 are 5,7,11. So 5*7*11=385. So if I can create 5 and 11 from the remaining numbers. Wait, the numbers left would be 1,96,41. Let's see, 96-41=55, which is 5*11. Oh! Wait, 96-41=55. Then 55=5*11. So 55*7=385. So that's 7*(96-41)=385. But then the problem says to use all numbers, including 1. So how to include the 1 here?\n\nAh! Maybe (7*(96 -41)) +1. But that would be 385 +1=386. But that's over. Or subtract 1: 385-1=384. But then I need to use all numbers. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe 7*(96 - (41 -1))? Let's compute: 41-1=40. 96-40=56. 7*56=392. Then 392-7=385? Wait, no. 392 is 7*56. If I subtract 7, but I already used 7. So that's not allowed. Alternatively, 392 - something else. But I don't have other numbers.\n\nWait, perhaps 7* (96/(41-1)) + something. Let's compute: 41-1=40. 96/40=2.4. 7*2.4=16.8. Then need to add 385-16.8=368.2, which is not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (96 +1) * (41 -7). Let's see: 96+1=97, 41-7=34. 97*34=3298. Too big.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, 41*7=287. 96-1=95. 287+95=382. Close to 385, but still 3 off. Not helpful.\n\nWait, 41*(7+1)=41*8=328. 328 +96=424. No.\n\nWait, 96* (41 -7) /1. Let's compute: 41-7=34, 34*96=3264. 3264/1=3264. Way too big.\n\nAlternatively, 96* (7 -1) +41. 7-1=6, 6*96=576. 576+41=617. Nope.\n\nHmm. Maybe using subtraction. Let's see, 96*7=672. 41-1=40. 672-40=632. Not close.\n\nWait, 41*10=410. How to get 10 from 96 and 7 and 1. 96/(7+1)=12. 12- (something). 12-2=10. But where do I get 2 from? Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 7* (41 + (96/ something)). Let's see, if I use 96 divided by 1, that's 96. So 7*(41+96) =7*137=959. Then subtract 1=958. No.\n\nHmm. This is tricky. Maybe I need to think outside the box. Wait, what if I use 96 and 1 to make 95 (96-1) and then multiply by 4. But 4 isn't a number here. Alternatively, 95*4=380, close to 385. But how to get 4 from 7 and 41? 41-7=34. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe 96* (7) =672. Then 672 - 41* something. Let's see, 672 -41*7=672-287=385. Oh! Wait a minute, that works. Let me check:\n\n96*7 = 672. Then 41*1=41. So 672 - (41*1* something). Wait, how to structure that. Let's see: 96*7 -41*1= 672 -41=631. Not 385. But if I do 96*7 - (41* something). Let's see, 672 - (41 * x)=385. So x= (672-385)/41=287/41=7. So 41*7=287. But then I have to use 7 twice, which is not allowed. Since I already used 7 in the multiplication with 96. So that's a problem.\n\nWait, but maybe I can rearrange operations. Let's see, if I have 96*7 = 672. Then I need to subtract 287 to get 385. 287 is 41*7. But I can't use 7 again. So that won't work.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 7* (96 - (41/1)). Let's compute 41/1=41. 96-41=55. 55*7=385. Oh! Wait, that uses 7, 96, 41, and 1. Yes! All numbers used once. Let's check:\n\n7*(96 - (41/1)) = 7*(96-41) =7*55=385. Yes! And all numbers are used once: 7, 96, 41, and 1 (as the denominator in 41/1). So the equation would be 7*(96 -41/1) =385. But since division by 1 doesn't change the value, maybe written as 7*(96 -41) but then the 1 is not used. Wait, wait, the original problem says we have to use all numbers. So if I use 41/1, then I have used 1. So the equation is 7 * (96 - (41 / 1)) = 385. That uses all numbers once each. Let me verify:\n\n41 divided by 1 is 41. 96 minus 41 is 55. 55 multiplied by 7 is 385. Yes. And all numbers 1,7,41,96 are used once. That works!\n</think>\n\n<answer>7 * (96 - (41 / 1))</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using the numbers 11, 54, 13, and 19, each exactly once, with basic operations to get 806. Hmm. Let me start by thinking about the target number. 806 is a pretty big number, so maybe multiplication is involved here. Let's look at the numbers I have. 54 is the largest, so perhaps multiplying that by another number could get close. Let's see: 54 multiplied by 19 is 1026. That's higher than 806. What if I subtract something from that? 1026 minus 13 would be 1013, still too high. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe 54 times 13 is 702. Then I need 104 more to reach 806. Wait, 702 plus 104 is 806. Do I have 11 and 19 left? Let me check. 11 plus 19 is 30, which isn't 104. So that approach might not work.\n\nWait, maybe combining 54 with another number in a different way. Let's see, 54 times (something). Let's try 54*(19-11). That would be 54*8=432. Then adding 13 gives 445. Not enough. Alternatively, 54*(13+11) =54*24=1296. Then subtract 19? 1296-19=1277. Still too high. Not helpful.\n\nWhat if I use division somewhere? Let's see. 54 divided by something. 54/11 is about 4.9, which might not be helpful. 19 divided by 13 is around 1.46. Maybe not. Hmm.\n\nAnother approach: 806 divided by 54 is approximately 14.9259. So maybe 54 multiplied by around 15. But how to get 15 from the remaining numbers 11,13,19. Wait, 13 + 19 -11 =21. So 54*21=1134. Then subtract something? Not helpful. Alternatively, 13 + (19-11) = 13+8=21. Same as before.\n\nWait, maybe 54*(19 - (13-11))). Let's compute inside the parentheses first: 13-11=2. Then 19-2=17. So 54*17=918. Then subtract... Wait, what's left? If I used 54,19,13,11 in that expression, then all numbers are used. Wait, 54*(19 - (13 -11)) =54*(19-2)=54*17=918. But 918 is not 806. So that's over. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 54*13=702. Then we have 19 and 11 left. Let's see, 702 + 19*11= 702 + 209=911. Still over. Alternatively, 702 +19 +11=732. Not enough. 702* (19-11)/something? Not sure. Wait, perhaps 702 + (19* (something)). 19*11=209. 702+209=911. No. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe subtract. 54*13=702. Then 702*19=13338. That's way too big. Not helpful. Maybe 54*19=1026. Then 1026 - (13*11)=1026 -143=883. Closer, but still not 806. Then 883-77=806, but where would 77 come from? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, 54*(11) =594. Then 594 +13=607. Then 607 +19=626. Not enough. Hmm.\n\nWhat about using division? Let's try 19*54=1026. Then 1026 divided by something. If I use 13 and 11. Maybe 1026/(13-11)=1026/2=513. Then add the remaining number? Wait, but I already used all numbers. Let me check: 19*54/(13-11) =513. But that uses 19,54,13,11. So that's all numbers. But 513 is way less than 806. Hmm.\n\nWait, another idea: (54 +13) * (19 -11). Let's compute that: 67*8=536. Not enough. Alternatively, (54-13)*(19+11)=41*30=1230. Not helpful.\n\nHow about combining multiplication and addition. Let's see: 13*54=702. Then 702 + 19 +11=732. Still not. 702 + 19*11=702+209=911. No. Maybe 54*(13 + (19-11)) =54*(13+8)=54*21=1134. Then subtract something? But I've already used all numbers. So that's not possible.\n\nWait, maybe using subtraction in a different way. Let's try 54*19=1026. Then subtract 13*11=143. 1026-143=883. Still not 806. 883-77=806. But where does 77 come from? Maybe I'm missing a trick here.\n\nWait, maybe the numbers can be combined in a different order. Let's think of 806 as 800 +6. How can I get 800? 54*14.814..., but not helpful. Alternatively, 19*42.42. Hmm. Maybe 19*42=798, then +8=806. But how to get 42 and 8 from 54,13,11. Let's see. 54-13=41. 41+1=42, but I don't have a 1. Alternatively, 11 + (54-13-19)=11+22=33. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe 13*11=143. Then 54*19=1026. 1026 -143=883. As before. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 54* (19+13). 54*32=1728. Then 1728 divided by 11. 1728/11≈157.09. Then subtract something? Not helpful.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to chain more operations. Let's consider 54*(13 + (19/11)). Since 19/11 is approximately 1.727. So 13 +1.727≈14.727. Then 54*14.727≈795. That's close to 806. If only there was a way to adjust. But 19/11 is a division, but then we have 54,13,19,11 used. Wait, 54*(13 + (19/11)) would use all numbers. Let me compute exactly: 19 divided by 11 is 1.727..., 13 + that is 14.727..., times 54: 54*14.727...≈54*14.727=54*14 +54*0.727≈756 + 39.3≈795.3. Close but not 806. So maybe that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, 54*(19 - (13/11)). Let's compute 13/11≈1.1818. 19-1.1818≈17.818. 54*17.818≈54*17 +54*0.818≈918 +44≈962. Not close.\n\nHmm. Maybe a different approach. Let's think of 806 as 62*13. Because 62*13=806. Wait, yes! 62*13=806. So if I can get 62 from 54,11,19, then multiply by 13. Let's try. How to make 62 from 54,11,19. 54 + 11 -19=46. Not 62. 54 +19=73. 73 -11=62. Yes! So 54 +19 -11=62. Then multiply by 13. So (54 +19 -11) *13=62*13=806. Let me check the numbers: 54,19,11,13. All used once. Operations: +, -, *. Perfect. That should be the equation.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(54 + 19 - 11) * 13 = 806</answer>"}]}

Let me list out the numbers: 73, 8, 75, 100. The target is 438. \n\nLet me start by considering the target number. 438 is a bit less than 500, so maybe subtracting something from a larger number. Let's see. If I use 100 and 75, those are the bigger numbers. 100 multiplied by something? 100*4.38 would be 438, but I don't have 4.38. Alternatively, maybe combining 75 and 100.

Hmm, 73 minus 8 is 65, which is too much. 8 could be part of another operation. Maybe 75*6 - (something) = 438. But how to get the 6? Maybe using 73 and 8. 73 minus 8 is 65, which doesn't help. 73 divided by 8 is about 9.125. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 100 * something. Let's see. 438 divided by 100 is 4.38. So if I can make 4.38 using 73, 8, and 75. But that seems tricky. Alternatively, 73 * 6 would be 438. Wait, 73*6=438 exactly. Oh! So if I can get 6 from 8, 75, and 100. But how?\n\nWait, but I have to use all four numbers. So 73 is already used, and then need to use 8, 75, and 100. So perhaps 73 multiplied by (some combination of 8,75,100) divided by something else. Wait, but how to get 6 from 8,75,100.\n\nAlternatively, 75 - (100 / something) = 6? Let's see. 100 divided by something is 75-6=69. 100/69 is not an integer. Hmm. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe using 8 in a division. Let's see, 100 - 75 =25. Then 25 -8=17. Not helpful. Maybe 75/(100- something). 75/(100 - 8) is 75/92≈0.815… Not useful.\n\nAlternatively, think of 438 as 73*6. So 73 multiplied by 6. But how to get 6 from 8,75,100. Let's see. 75 - (100 / something). 100 divided by 8 is 12.5. Then 75 - 12.5 is 62.5. Not 6. Alternatively, 100 - 75 =25. Then 25 -8=17. Still not 6. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, 8 * something. Let me think. Maybe 100 - (75 / 8) = 100 -9.375=90.625. Then 73*90.625 is way bigger than 438. That's not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe a different approach. Let's try combining 75 and 100 first. 100 +75=175. Then 175 * something. 175*2.5=437.5, which is close to 438. But how to get 2.5 from 73 and 8. 73/8=9.125. Not helpful. Alternatively, 8/(73-75). Wait, but that would be 8/(-2)= -4. Then 175 * (-4) is -700. No. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 100 -75=25. Then 25 *8=200. Then 200 +73=273. Not 438. Hmm.\n\nWait, what if we do 75*8=600. Then 600 - (100 +73)=600-173=427. Close to 438, but 11 short. Hmm. Not quite. Alternatively, 75*8=600. Then 600 - (100 -73)=600-27=573. No, that's higher.\n\nAlternatively, 100*8=800.

Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, 100*5=500. 500-62=438. How to get 62 from 75,73,8. 75 -13=62. How to get 13 from 73 and 8. 73 divided by 8 is about 9.125. 73-8=65. Not helpful. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe 73 - (8* something). 8*9=72. 73-72=1. But not helpful. Maybe 8* something else.\n\nAlternatively, try 75+8=83. 83*5=415. 415+23=438.

Not helpful.\n\nWait, what if we do 73*(100 -75) +8. Let's compute that: 73*25 +8=1825 +8=1833. Nope.\n\nHmm. Maybe 75* (8 - (100 /73)). Let's see, 100/73≈1.369. 8-1.369≈6.631. 75*6.631≈497.3. Not 438.\n\nAlternatively, 75*(8 + (73/100)). 73/100=0.73. 8+0.73=8.73. 75*8.73≈654.75. No.\n\nAnother idea: 438 divided by 73 is 6. So maybe 73 multiplied by (some combination of the other numbers) equals 438. So if I can get 6 from 8,75,100. Let's see. 100 - 75=25. Then 25 -8=17. Not 6. 75 divided by something. 75/12.5=6. But how to get 12.5 from 100 and 8. 100 divided by 8 is 12.5. Oh! Wait. 100 divided by 8 is 12.5. Then 75 divided by 12.5 is 6. So 75 divided by (100 /8) equals 6. Then 73 multiplied by that gives 73*6=438. Let me check that:\n\n75 ÷ (100 ÷8) =75 ÷12.5=6. Then 73 *6=438. Yes! So the equation would be 73 * (75 ÷ (100 ÷8)) =438. Let's verify:\n\nFirst compute 100 ÷8=12.5. Then 75 ÷12.5=6. Then 73*6=438. Perfect. And all numbers are used once: 73,75,100,8. So the equation is 73*(75/(100/8)) =438. Let's write that with parentheses properly: 73 * (75 / (100 /8)).\n\nAlternatively, we can write it as 73 × (75 ÷ (100 ÷ 8)) which is the same. So that should be the correct equation.\n</think>\n\n<answer>73 * (75 / (100 / 8))</answer>"}]}

Then subtract 35 would be 62, which is too low. If I subtract 10 instead, 97 - 10 = 87. Still too high. Hmm.\n\nWhat if I use 55 - 10? That gives 45. Then maybe add 35? 45 + 35 = 80.

No. Not 67.\n\nWait, maybe multiplication or division can help. Let's see. 42 divided by 10 is 4.2. Not sure if that's useful. 55 divided by 10 is 5.5. Hmm. Not sure.\n\nWhat if I do 35 multiplied by 2, but I don't have a 2. Wait, maybe combine numbers to get a multiplier. For example, (55 - 10) =45. Then 45 + (35 - 42) =45 -7=38. No.\n\nWait, maybe 55 - (42 / 10) ? That's 55 -4.2=50.8. Then add 35? 50.8 +35=85.8. Not 67.\n\nAlternatively, 42 - (55 /10) =42 -5.5=36.5. Then add 35=71.5. Still not.\n\nHmm. Let's think differently. Maybe 35 + 42 =77. Then 77 -10=67. Oh, wait! That uses 35, 42, subtract 10. But then we still have 55 left. We need to use all four numbers.

Nope.\n\nWait, what if I do 55 + 10 =65. Then 65 + (42 /35). But 42 divided by 35 is 1.2, so total is 66.2, which is close but not 67. And also, we need to use all numbers once. So 42 and 35 are both used here. But 42/35 uses both, so that's okay. But the total would be 55 +10 + (42/35) ≈ 65 +1.2=66.2. Not exact. Also, maybe fractions are allowed?\n\nWait, the problem says create an equation that equals 67. So exact, not approximate. So fractions might not work unless they can exactly add up. Let's see, 42 divided by 35 is 6/5 (since 42=6*7, 35=5*7, so 42/35=6/5=1.2). So 55 +10 +6/5=65 +1.2=66.2. Not 67. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, 55 - (42 / (35 -10)). Let's compute denominator:35-10=25. So 42/25=1.68. Then 55 -1.68=53.32. Not helpful.\n\nWhat about 55 * (something). 55*1.2=66. Close. But again, how to get 1.2. 42/35=1.2. So 55*(42/35) +10. Let's compute: 55*(42/35)=55*(6/5)=66. Then 66 +10=76. No. Alternatively, 55*(42/35) -10=66-10=56. Not 67.\n\nWait, perhaps 55 + 42 - (35 -10). Let's compute: 55+42=97. Then 35-10=25. 97-25=72. Not 67.\n\nAnother approach: 35 + 55=90. 42 -10=32. 90 -32=58. Still no.\n\nWait, maybe 55 + (35 - (42 /10)). Compute 42/10=4.2. Then 35-4.2=30.8. 55+30.8=85.8. Not 67.\n\nHmm. Maybe combining operations in a different order. Let's think of 67 as 55 + 12. How to get 12 from 35, 10, 42. 42 -35=7. 10 +7=17. Not 12. Alternatively, 35 - (10 + something). Wait, 42 - (35 +10)=42-45=-3. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 10*(something) + something else. For example, 10*6=60, then +7=67. But how to get 6 and 7 from remaining numbers. 42 and 35. 42-35=7. Then 35/ (42- something). Hmm.\n\nWait, 35 divided by 5 is 7. But where to get 5. 10 divided by 2. But no 2. Wait, 55 divided by 11. But no 11. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, 10 + 55 =65. Then 65 +2=67. How to get 2 from 35 and 42. 42-35=7. Not 2. 35 divided by 42 is 5/6. 5/6 ≈0.833. 65 +0.833≈65.833. Not 67.\n\nWait, 10 * (something) + something else. For example, 10*5=50. Then 50 +17=67. 17 can be 55 -38. But 38? Where. 42 -4=38. Then 4 comes from 35 divided by something. Not sure. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, 55 + (42 / 6) =55 +7=62. Then +5=67. But how to get 6 and 5. 10 - (something). Maybe 35-30=5. But I don't have 30. This is getting too convoluted.\n\nWait, maybe using subtraction and addition. Let's try 55 + 35=90. Then 42 -10=32. 90 -32=58. Still no.\n\nWait another approach: 67 is a prime number. So perhaps combining two numbers via subtraction and then adding or multiplying. For example, 55 - 10=45. Then 45 + 42=87. 87 -35=52. No.\n\nWait, 35 + 10=45. Then 55 -42=13. 45 +13=58. No.\n\nHow about 55 - (35 -10)=55 -25=30. Then 42 -30=12. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe (55 + 42) - (35 -10). Let's compute: 55+42=97. 35-10=25. 97-25=72. Not 67.\n\nHmm. Maybe (55 - 35) + (42 -10). That's 20 +32=52. Not 67.\n\nWait, 55 + 10=65. Now, to get 2 from 35 and 42. 42-35=7. 7-5=2. But how to get 5. Not helpful. Alternatively, 35 divided by something. 35/(42 - something). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, 55 - (42/(35/10)). Let's compute denominator:35/10=3.5. Then 42/3.5=12. So 55 -12=43. Then 43 +24=67. Wait, but we have to use all numbers. So 55,42,35,10 are used here? Let's see: 35/10 is used, then 42 divided by that result, then subtract from 55. So yes, all numbers are used: 55, 42, 35, 10. So the equation would be 55 - (42 / (35 / 10)). Let's compute this:\n\nFirst, 35 divided by 10 is 3.5. Then 42 divided by 3.5 is 12. Then 55 -12=43. Not 67. So that gives 43. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe rearrange the parentheses. (55 - 42) * (35 /10). Compute 13 *3.5=45.5. Not 67.\n\nHmm. Maybe 55 + (35 * (something)). Let's see. 35*2=70. 55+12=67. Wait, how to get 12. 42 - (10 *3)=12. But where does 3 come from. Not possible.\n\nAlternatively, 55 + ((42 -35) * (10 / something)). 42-35=7. 10 divided by something. If I do 10/1=10, but I don't have 1. Alternatively, 10/(something else). Not sure.\n\nWait, 35 divided by 10 is 3.5. 42 -3.5=38.5. Then 55 +38.5=93.5. No.\n\nAlternatively, 42 -10=32. 55 -35=20. 32 +20=52. No.\n\nWait, maybe (55 + 10) * (42 -35). So 65 *7=455. Way too big.\n\nHmm. Maybe (55 * 10) - (42 *35). That's 550 -1470= -920. Nope.\n\nThis is getting frustrating. Maybe I need to think outside the box. Let's see: 67 can be made with 55 + 12. How to get 12 from 10, 35, 42.\n\nWait, 42 - 35 =7. Then 10 +7=17. No. 35 -10=25. 42 -25=17. Still not 12. Alternatively, 42 divided by something. 42 divided by 3.5=12. But 3.5 is 35/10. So 42/(35/10)=12. Then 55 +12=67. Oh! Wait, that uses all four numbers. Let me check:\n\nThe equation would be 55 + (42 / (35 / 10)) = ?\n\nFirst, compute 35 divided by 10: 35/10 = 3.5\n\nThen, 42 divided by 3.5 = 12\n\nThen, 55 +12=67.\n\nYes! So the equation is 55 + (42 / (35 / 10)) =67. Let's verify all numbers are used once: 55, 42, 35, 10. Yes. All used. And operations are division inside the parentheses and addition. So this should work.\n</think>\n\n<answer>55 + (42 / (35 / 10))</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using the numbers 85, 880, 85, and 83, each exactly once, with basic operations, to get 797. Hmm. Let me start by thinking about the target number. 797 is a prime number, right? So factoring might not help directly. Maybe I can combine some of these numbers through multiplication or division to get close, then adjust with addition or subtraction.\n\nFirst, looking at the numbers: 880 is the largest, so maybe that's a good starting point. If I subtract something from 880, could that give me 797? Let's check: 880 - 83 = 797. Oh, wait! But then I have to use the other numbers too: 85, 85, and 83. Wait, if I subtract 83 from 880, that's 797. But then I still have the two 85s left. How can I incorporate them without changing the result? Maybe I need to use them in a way that cancels out. Like, (880 - 83) + (85 - 85). But 85 -85 is zero, so that would just give 797 + 0 = 797. But does that use all the numbers? Let me check: 880, 83, 85, 85. Yes, all are used once. Wait, but the problem says \"each number can only be used once\". Wait, the original numbers given are 85, 880, 85, 83. So there are two 85s. So using both 85s is allowed since they are separate instances. So in that case, the equation would be 880 - 83 + 85 -85. But let me compute that: 880 -83 is 797, then +85 is 882, then -85 is 797 again. So the equation would be (880 - 83) + (85 -85) = 797. But maybe written as 880 -83 +85 -85. Is that acceptable? Let me check: all numbers are used once, operations are + and -. So that works. But I want to make sure that the parentheses are placed correctly. Alternatively, maybe it can be written as 880 -83 + (85 -85) = 797. Since 85-85 is zero, adding that doesn't change the value. So that works. But wait, does that use all numbers? Let's see: 880, 83, 85, 85. Yes, all are used once. So that equation would be valid. But maybe the problem expects all numbers to be used in a single expression without zero operations. Hmm. Let me check again the problem statement: \"create an equation that equals 797. You can use basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) one or multiple times but each number can only be used once, and you must use all the numbers.\" So using each number once, including both 85s. So the equation I just thought of does that. However, perhaps the problem expects a different approach where all operations are necessary, but maybe the user would find that acceptable. Let me verify the calculation: 880 -83 is 797. Then adding 85 and subtracting 85 cancels out. So yes, it's a valid equation. But maybe there's another way without relying on cancellation. Let me see if that's possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using multiplication or division. Let's see. Let's consider 880 divided by something. 880 divided by 1.1 is 800, but I don't have 1.1. Alternatively, 880 divided by 85. Let me calculate 880 ÷85. 85*10=850, so 880-850=30, so 85*10.35≈880. So 880 ÷85 is approximately 10.35. Hmm, not sure if that helps. If I take 880 ÷85, that's 10.3529..., then maybe multiply by 83? But then I have to use the other 85. Not sure. Let's try: 880 /85 = 10.3529, then multiply by 83: 10.3529 *83 ≈ 859. Then subtract the other number? But I need to use all numbers. Wait, perhaps 83*(880/85) -85. Let's compute that. 880 divided by 85 is approximately 10.3529. Multiply by 83: 10.3529 *83 ≈ 859. Then subtract 85: 859 -85 = 774. Not 797. Not close enough. Alternatively, maybe 85*(something) + something else. Let's see. 85*9 =765, which is 32 away from 797. Not sure. Alternatively, 85*10=850. 850-53=797. But where would the 53 come from? 880-83=797, but that's the earlier approach. Alternatively, maybe combine 83 and 85. Like 83 +85=168. Then 880 -168=712. Then using the other 85: 712 +85=797. Wait, that would be 880 - (83 +85) +85. But let's check: 83 +85 =168. 880 -168 =712. 712 +85=797. But how does that use all numbers? Let's see: 880, 83, 85, 85. So that uses all of them. So the equation would be 880 - (83 +85) +85. Which simplifies to 880 -83 -85 +85 = 880 -83 =797. So same as before. So in that case, the equation is 880 -83 -85 +85 =797. Which again uses all numbers. Alternatively, written as (880 - (83 +85)) +85. Either way, the key is that the two 85s cancel each other. So that's a possible solution.\n\nBut perhaps the problem expects a more \"complex\" equation where each operation is necessary. Let me try another approach. Maybe using multiplication. For example, 85* something. Let's see. 85*9=765, 85*10=850. 850 is closer to 797. 850-53=797. How to get 53? From 880 - 83 =797. Wait, but that's the same as before. Alternatively, 880 - (85 -83)*something. Let's see. 85 -83=2. Then 880 -2*X=797. So 2X=880-797=83. So X=41.5. But I need to use the remaining numbers. The remaining number is 85. So 41.5 is not 85. So that might not work. Alternatively, 880 - (85/85)*83. Let's see: 85/85=1. Then 1*83=83. 880-83=797. So that would be 880 - (85/85)*83 =797. That uses all numbers: 880, 85,85,83. So let's check: 85 divided by 85 is 1, multiplied by 83 is 83. 880-83=797. Yes, that works. And all numbers are used: 880, 85,85,83. Each once. So this equation is 880 - (85 /85) *83 =797. Let me verify the calculation: 85 divided by 85 is 1. 1 times 83 is 83. 880 minus 83 is 797. Correct. And all numbers are used once. So this seems like a valid solution. So the equation is 880 - (85 /85) *83 =797. That works. Alternatively, the parentheses can be arranged differently, but as long as the order of operations is respected. For example, 880 - 83 * (85 /85) would also work because multiplication and division have higher precedence. So 85/85 is 1, multiplied by 83 is 83, subtracted from 880 gives 797. So that's another valid way to write it. Either way, this seems like a better solution because it uses all numbers and operations in a non-trivial way, not just canceling out the two 85s. But maybe both approaches are valid. Let me check the problem statement again: \"using the numbers 85, 880, 85, 83, create an equation that equals 797. You can use basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) one or multiple times but each number can only be used once, and you must use all the numbers.\" So both solutions would work. But the problem might prefer the one that doesn't have terms that cancel out. However, since both are valid, I should present the one that seems more \"elegant\". The second approach using division and multiplication might be preferable. Let me confirm the calculation again: 85 divided by 85 is 1. Multiply by 83: 1*83=83. Subtract from 880: 880-83=797. Correct. So the equation is 880 - 83 × (85 ÷ 85) = 797. Alternatively, 880 - (85 ÷ 85) ×83. Either way, that's acceptable. So this uses all numbers and operations. Therefore, this is a valid solution.\n</think>\n\n<answer>880 - 83 * (85 / 85) = 797</answer>"}]}

Hmm, let's start by thinking about how these numbers can combine to get to 4.\n\nFirst, maybe I can look for ways to reduce the larger numbers. 78 and 50 are pretty big, so maybe dividing them or subtracting them could help. Let's see, 78 divided by something... 78 divided by 6 is 13. But 13 is still a bit high. Maybe if I subtract that from another number. Wait, 50 divided by something? 50 divided by 30 is about 1.666, which might not be helpful. Or 30 divided by 6 is 5. So 5 and then what? Let's jot down some possibilities.\n\nWhat if I use 30 and 6 first. 30 divided by 6 is 5. Then, if I can get from 78 and 50 to something that subtracts 1, because 5 -1 =4. So how do I get 1 from 78 and 50? Maybe 50 divided by (78 - 50)? Wait, 78 -50 is 28, and 50/28 is approximately 1.78. Not exactly 1. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe (78 -50) divided by 28? But that's still 1. Or maybe 50 divided by (something else). Wait, but I already used 30 and 6. So maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of combining 78 and 50. 78 -50 is 28. Then 28 divided by something. If I have 28 divided by 7, that's 4. But where do I get 7 from? Maybe 30 - 6 =24. No, that's not 7. Wait, 30 divided by 6 is 5. So 5 and then... Hmm, maybe not. Let's try a different approach.\n\nAnother angle: 78 minus 30 is 48. 48 divided by something. If I can get 48 divided by 12, that's 4. How to get 12 from the remaining numbers, 6 and 50. 50 minus 6 is 44. Not helpful. 50 divided by 6 is about 8.333. Not 12. Alternatively, 50 plus 6 is 56. Still not 12. Maybe multiply? 6 times something. 6 times 2 is 12. But how to get 2 from 50. 50 divided by 25 is 2, but I don't have 25. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe use all numbers. Let's see: If I do (78 - 50) which is 28, then 30 divided by 6 is 5. Now, 28 divided by 5 is 5.6. Not 4. Hmm. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, (78 + 50) is 128. Then 128 divided by something. If I can get 32, then 128/32=4. How to get 32 from 30 and 6. 30 +6 is 36. 128/36 is about 3.555. Not 4. Alternatively, 30 -6=24. 128/24≈5.333. Nope.\n\nWhat about combining division and subtraction. Maybe 78 divided by something minus something else. For example, 78 / 6 =13. Then 13 minus (50/30). 50/30≈1.666, so 13-1.666≈11.333. Not 4.\n\nAlternatively, 50 divided by (something). 50 / 12.5=4. How to get 12.5 from 78, 30, and 6. Hmm. 30 - (78/6). Wait, 78/6=13. So 30-13=17. 50/17≈2.941. Not helpful. Or maybe (30 +6)=36. 50/36≈1.388. Then 78/1.388≈56. That's not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe subtract two large numbers and divide by another. For example, (78 -50)=28. Then 28 divided by 7 is 4. How to get 7 from 30 and 6. 30 divided by 6 is 5. 5 plus 2 is 7. But where do I get 2? Hmm. Not possible with remaining numbers.\n\nAlternatively, 30 divided by 6 is 5. Then 5 minus something equals 4. So that something would be 1. How to get 1 from 78 and 50. Maybe (78 -50)=28. Then 28 divided by 28=1. But that uses 78,50, and then 28 again which isn't allowed. Alternatively, 50 divided by something. 50 divided by 50 is 1, but that would use 50 again. Not allowed.\n\nWait, maybe use multiplication. Let's think: 6 * something is 24, then 78 -24=54. 54 divided by something. Not sure. Let's see. If I do 6 * 5 =30, but that's already one of the numbers. Wait, 6 multiplied by (something using 50 and 78). Not sure.\n\nAnother approach: Combine 50 and 30. 50 -30=20. Then 78 divided by 20=3.9. Close to 4. If I can adjust with 6. Maybe 3.9 +0.1=4. But how to get 0.1 from 6. 6 divided by something. 6/60=0.1, but don't have 60. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe 78 divided by (50 -30/6). Let's calculate that. 30/6=5. Then 50-5=45. 78/45≈1.733. Not 4. No.\n\nAlternatively, (78 - (50 -30)) /6. Let's see: 50-30=20. 78-20=58. 58/6≈9.666. Not 4.\n\nWhat if I do (78 +6) =84. Then 84 divided by something. 84/21=4. How to get 21 from 50 and30. 50-30=20. 20+1=21, but where's 1? Maybe 30/30=1, but can't reuse 30. Not helpful.\n\nHmm, maybe (30 - (78 -50))/6. Let's compute: 78-50=28. 30-28=2. Then 2/6≈0.333. Not 4.\n\nWait, maybe (50 - (78/6)) * (30 - something). Let's break it down. 78/6=13. 50-13=37. Then 37 multiplied by something. But we need 4, so probably division.

Maybe (78 -50) + (30/6). 78-50=28; 30/6=5. 28+5=33. Not 4.\n\nWait, perhaps ((78 / 6) - (50 /30)). Let's calculate:78/6=13;50/30≈1.666. 13-1.666≈11.333. Not 4.\n\nWhat if we do (50 - 30) / (78 /6). 50-30=20;78/6=13. 20/13≈1.538. Not 4.\n\nAlternatively, (78 - (50 +30)) /6. 50+30=80;78-80=-2; -2/6≈-0.333. No.\n\nWait a second. Let's try using all four numbers in a different way. Let's consider 78, 30,6,50. Maybe 78 - (30 * (50 /6)). Let's compute 50/6≈8.333. 30*8.333≈250. 78-250≈-172. Way off.\n\nAlternatively, (78 / (50 -30)) +6. 50-30=20.78/20=3.9. 3.9+6=9.9. Not 4.\n\nHmm. Maybe (30 - (78 / (50 -6))). Let's compute denominator:50-6=44. 78/44≈1.7727. Then 30-1.7727≈28.227. Nope.\n\nWait, think outside the box. Maybe combine numbers in a different way. For example, 50 divided by (30 - (78/6)). Let's compute 78/6=13. Then 30-13=17. 50/17≈2.941. Not 4.\n\nAnother angle: 6/(78 -50 -30). Let's compute denominator:78-50=28;28-30=-2. 6/-2=-3. Not 4.\n\nWait, perhaps (78 - (50 +30)) *6. 50+30=80;78-80=-2; -2*6=-12. No.\n\nHmm. Maybe (30 +50) - (78 +6). 30+50=80;78+6=84;80-84=-4. Oh, that's -4. Close but negative. If I could reverse the order, but I have to use all numbers once. Wait, maybe (78 +6) - (30 +50). 78+6=84;30+50=80;84-80=4. Oh! That's 4! Let me check that. 78 +6 is 84, 30 +50 is 80. Then 84 -80=4. Yes! But wait, have I used all numbers? Let me see: 78,6,30,50. Yes, all used once. And the operations are addition and subtraction. So the equation is (78 +6) - (30 +50) =4. Let me verify: 78+6=84, 30+50=80, 84-80=4. Perfect.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(78 + 6) - (30 + 50) = 4</answer>"}]}

All numbers must be used exactly once, and I can use basic operations. Hmm, let's start by thinking about what operations might get me close to 434.\n\nFirst, 434 is a pretty big number. Let me see what the largest numbers here are. We have two 61s, which are the biggest. Maybe multiplying those could help. 61 times 61 is 3721, which is way too big. That's probably not the right path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe adding the two 61s: 61 + 61 = 122. Then we have 31 and 14 left. If I add those, 31 +14=45. 122 +45=167. Not enough. Hmm, that's not working.\n\nWhat if I subtract instead? Let's see. 61 - 61 is 0, which isn't helpful. How about 61 multiplied by something else. Let's think. If I use 61 * 7, that's 427, which is close to 434. Oh, wait, 434 - 427 is 7. But where would I get a 7 from? Maybe 14 divided by 2 is 7, but I don't have a 2 here. Wait, maybe 14 can be split into 7 and 2, but we can only use the numbers once. Alternatively, 31 - 14 =17, but I don't know if that helps.\n\nWait, let's think differently. Maybe combine 31 and 14 first. Let's see, 31 *14 is 434. Wait, 31 times 14 is exactly 434! Oh! So if I can get 31 *14, that gives me 434. But then I need to use the two 61s. The problem requires using all the numbers. So how can I incorporate the two 61s into this equation without changing the product of 31 and 14?\n\nHmm, maybe subtract or add the 61s in a way that cancels them out. For example, 31 *14 +61 -61. That would be 434 +0=434. But does that work? Let's check: 31*14 is 434, then adding 61 and subtracting 61 gives 434. So the equation would be (31 * 14) +61 -61. But does that use all the numbers? Yes: 31,14,61,61. Each used once. That's valid. But is there another way? Because maybe the problem expects a more complex use, but technically this works.\n\nBut let me verify. The equation would be (31 × 14) + 61 − 61 = 434. Alternatively, (31 ×14) + (61 -61) =434. That's correct. But perhaps the problem expects that the numbers are used in a way that each is used in a more integral part of the equation rather than just canceling each other. But according to the rules given, this should be acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another approach. Let's see. Suppose I take 61 multiplied by something. Let's see 61 *7 is 427, which is 7 less than 434. Wait, 7 can be obtained from 14/2. But I don't have a 2. But 14 is one of the numbers. So 14 divided by (61/61) would give 14/1=14. So 61*(7) +14=434. Wait, but 7 is 14/2, but again, we don't have 2. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, 61*(31 - (14/61)). Let's compute that: 14/61 is approximately 0.2295. 31 -0.2295≈30.7705. Then 61 *30.7705≈1877, which is way over. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe combine 61 and 14 first. 61+14=75. Then 75* something. 75*5.786≈434, but not sure. Alternatively, 61 -14=47. Not helpful.\n\nWhat if I do 61*(something) + something else. Let's see. 61*7=427, as before. Then 427 +7=434. But where to get the 7. 31 - (something)=7. 31-24=7. But 24 isn't available. Alternatively, 14/2=7, but again, no 2. But 61 and 61, maybe (61/61)=1, then 14 - (61/61)=13. Not helpful.\n\nWait, here's another idea. If I can write 434 as 61*7 +7, then 7 comes from 14/2. But perhaps (61 + (14/(61/31))). Let me check that. Let's compute the denominator first: 61/31 ≈1.9677. Then 14 divided by that is approximately 14/1.9677≈7.11. Then 61 +7.11≈68.11. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 61*(31 - (14/61)). Let's calculate that. 14/61≈0.2295. 31-0.2295≈30.7705. Then 61*30.7705≈1877. Not helpful.\n\nHmm. Maybe I should go back to the first idea where 31*14=434, and then the two 61s are used as 61-61=0. So the equation is 31*14 +61-61=434. That works, uses all numbers once. Let me check if there's any rule against that. The problem states that each number can be used once and all must be used. So 61 is used twice, but each instance is used once. Wait, wait, the numbers given are 61, 61, 31, 14. So two 61s. So we have to use both 61s. So in the equation, 61-61 uses both 61s once each. So that's acceptable. So (31*14) +61 -61 =434. That's correct. Alternatively, written as (31 × 14) + (61 - 61) =434. That's a valid equation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 31* (61 - (61/14)). Let's see. 61/14≈4.357. 61 -4.357≈56.643. Then 31*56.643≈1755, which is way too big.\n\nAlternatively, (61 +61) * (31 -14). Let's see: 122 *17=2074. No, too big.\n\nAnother approach: 61 * (31 - (14/61)). Let's compute 14/61≈0.2295. 31-0.2295≈30.7705. 61*30.7705≈1877. No.\n\nHmm. How about 61*7 + 31*7. Wait, 7*(61+31)=7*92=644. Not helpful. Or 61*6 + 31* something. Not sure.\n\nWait, let's think again. The simplest solution is to use 31*14=434 and then use 61-61 to consume the other two numbers. That seems to fit all the requirements. So the equation would be (31 × 14) + 61 - 61 =434. That's valid, uses all numbers once each (since each 61 is used once in the subtraction), and equals 434. So I think this is the answer.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(31 * 14) + 61 - 61 = 434</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using the numbers 20, 72, 28, and 63, each exactly once, and combine them with basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) to get 695. Hmm, 695 is a pretty big number, so maybe multiplication will be involved here. Let me start by thinking about possible products.\n\nFirst, let me check the largest numbers here: 72 and 63. If I multiply those two, that's 72*63. Let me calculate that: 70*60=4200, 70*3=210, 2*60=120, 2*3=6. So 4200+210+120+6=4536. That's way too big. So maybe 72*63 is too much. But perhaps combining that with division or subtraction? Let me see. If I use 72*63, then subtract something. Wait, 72*63 is 4536. 4536 minus the other numbers 20 and 28. Let's see: 4536 - 20 - 28 = 4536 - 48 = 4488. Still way too big. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe divide 4536 by something. If I divide by 20, then 4536/20 = 226.8. Then maybe add or subtract the remaining numbers. But 226.8 +28 +63? Wait, but I've already used 63 and 72. So that approach might not work. Let me backtrack.\n\nLet me think of smaller combinations. Let's try 72 and 28. 72*28 = 2016. Then subtract 63 and 20? 2016 -63 -20 = 1933. Still not 695. Alternatively, 72+28=100. Then 100* something. But then the other numbers are 20 and 63. 100*63=6300. Then subtract 20? 6300-20=6280. Not helpful. Hmm.\n\nWhat if I use 63 multiplied by something. 63*20=1260. Then subtract 72 and 28: 1260 -72 -28= 1260-100=1160. Still too high. Alternatively, 63*28=1764. Then subtract 72 and 20: 1764-72=1692, 1692-20=1672. Nope.\n\nWait, 72 divided by 28 is about 2.571. Then maybe 72/28= 18/7. Let's see. If I take 63 and multiply by (72/28), that's 63*(72/28). Let me compute that: 63 divided by 28 is 2.25, then 2.25*72=162. Then add 20: 162+20=182. Not close.\n\nAlternatively, 63*(20 + 72/28). Let's compute inside the parentheses first: 72/28=18/7≈2.571. 20 + 2.571≈22.571. 63*22.571≈1422. Which is way too big. Hmm.\n\nMaybe using subtraction and division. Let's see, 72 - 28 =44. Then 44*63=2772. Then subtract 20? 2772-20=2752. Still not.\n\nWait, maybe 72* (63 -28). 63-28=35. 72*35=2520. Then subtract 20? 2520-20=2500. No. Not 695.\n\nWhat if I do (72 + 63) * something. 72+63=135. Then 135* something. 135*5=675. Close to 695. How to get 5 from the remaining numbers 20 and 28. 28-20=8. Not 5. 28/20=1.4. Hmm. 20/28≈0.714. Not helpful. So 135*5. Let's see, 135*5=675. 675 +20=695. Wait, but where do I get the 5? Because I need to use all numbers. Let's see. Wait, if I can get 5 from 28 and something else. But I've already used 72 and 63. The numbers left are 20 and 28. Wait, maybe 28 - (20 / something). Wait, but 20 is already a number. Let me try to rephrase.\n\nWait, if I have 72 and 63 as 72 + 63 =135. Then, 28 - (20 / something). But I need to use all numbers. Let me think: Maybe 135*(28 - (20 / something)). Wait, but 20 is already used as a number. Alternatively, maybe 135*( something ) + or - the remaining numbers. Wait, but I need to use all four numbers once each. So if I use 72 and 63 as 135, then I have 20 and 28 left. So perhaps 135 * (28 - 20) =135*8=1080. Then, not helpful. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, 135 + (28 * something) +20. 28*20=560. 135+560=695. Wait, that's 135 + 560 =695. But how can I get 560 using 28 and 20? Oh, 28*20=560. Then, 72 +63=135. Then 135 + (28*20)=135+560=695. Wait, but let's check if all numbers are used once. 72,63,28,20 – yes. So the equation would be (72 + 63) + (28 * 20). Let's compute that. 72+63=135. 28*20=560. 135 +560=695. Yes! That works. Let me verify:\n\n28*20 =560.\n\n72 +63=135.\n\n560 +135=695.\n\nYes! So the equation is 28*20 +72 +63. Wait, but each number is used once. 28,20,72,63. All four numbers are used once each. The operations are multiplication and addition. So the equation would be 28 * 20 + 72 + 63. Let me compute that again: 28*20=560, 560+72=632, 632+63=695. Perfect.\n\nBut wait, the problem states that you must use all the numbers and each only once. So in this case, each is used once. So the equation would be (28 × 20) + 72 + 63 = 695. So putting parentheses appropriately, maybe (28 * 20) + (72 + 63) = 695. Either way, the order of operations works because multiplication is done first. So the equation is correct.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(28 * 20) + 72 + 63 = 695</answer>"}]}

Not sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe 495 is 11*45, but again, not sure. Let's see what numbers I have. 188 is a large number, so maybe multiplying that by something. Let's check 188*3 is 564, which is more than 495. Then 188 + 3 = 191. Not helpful. 188 - 3 is 185. Hmm. Maybe combine 188 with another number. What if I subtract something from 188? Let's think. 188 - 31 = 157. Then 157*3 is 471. Still not 495. Or 188 - 38 = 150. Then 150*3=450. 450 + 31=481. Not enough.\n\nWait, maybe using division. Let's see.

Let's see, 31*16 is 496. Close. 31*16=496. But I don't have 16. Wait, 38-3=35, not helpful. Maybe 38*13=494. Also close. 13 is 31-18, but not sure. Alternatively, 38*13 is 494, which is one less than 495. Maybe if I can get 38*13 +1=495. But how to get 1 from 3 and 188? 188/3 is about 62.666. Not helpful. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 3* (something) = 495. Let's see. 495/3=165. So if I can get 165 from 188,31,38. Let's see. 188 -31=157. 157 +8=165. But where does the 8 come from? 38 - 30=8, but that uses numbers again. Wait, 38 - (something). If I do 38 - (31 -3)= 38-28=10. Not sure. Alternatively, 188 - (31 +38) =188-69=119. Then 119*3=357. Not 495. \n\nWait, let's try another approach. Maybe combining 31 and 38. 31 +38=69. 188 -69=119. Then 119*3=357. Not helpful. Alternatively, 31*38=1178. Then 1178/3=392.666. Then 392.666 + something. Not helpful. \n\nWhat if we use division in a clever way. For example, (188 * 3) + (38 -31). Let's calculate: 188*3=564, 38-31=7. 564+7=571. No. 564-7=557.

Alternatively, 3 - (188/ something). 188 divided by 188 is 1. So 3 - (188/188) = 2. Not 1. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe 188 - (3*31) = 188 -93=95. Then 95*5=475. But 5? Not available.

Since we can use the numbers each once and all operations. Let me make sure I didn't miss any restrictions. The problem says you can use the operations multiple times, and each number once.

Let me start by thinking about what operations might lead to larger numbers since 638 is a bit big. Multiplication tends to increase values quickly, so maybe I should look for ways to multiply some of these numbers together.\n\nFirst, let me check if any two numbers multiplied get close to 638. Let's see: 43*15 is 645, which is close. But 15 isn't one of the numbers. Wait, but maybe combining two numbers through addition or subtraction first, then multiplying. Let's list the possible products:\n\n29*43 = 1247 (too big)\n29*74 = 2146 (way too big)\n29*53 = 1537 (still too big)\n43*74 = 3182 (way over)\n43*53 = 2279\n74*53 = 3922\n\nAll these are way over 638. So maybe multiplication isn't the way to go for two numbers. Maybe combining three numbers with operations. Let's think differently. Perhaps a combination of multiplication and addition or subtraction.\n\nWait, 638 divided by one of the numbers might give another number. Let's see: 638 ÷ 43 is approximately 14.837. Hmm, 14.837 isn't one of the other numbers. 638 ÷ 53 is about 12.037, which isn't helpful. 638 ÷ 29 is around 22, but 22 isn't in the list. 638 ÷74 is roughly 8.62. Not helpful either.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using division to reduce a number and then multiply. For example, (74 / 29) is about 2.55. Then multiply by something else. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can structure the equation as (a + b) * (c - d), but since we have four numbers, perhaps using two operations. Wait, but how to arrange them. Let's try some combinations.\n\nLet's take 74 and 53. 74 + 53 = 127. Then 127 * 5 = 635, which is close to 638. But 5 isn't among the numbers. Alternatively, 127 * 5.05... Hmm. Not helpful.\n\nWait, 43 and 29: 43 - 29 = 14. Then 14 * 53 = 742. 742 - 74 = 668. Not 638. Or 742 - 104? Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 74 * 53 is 3922, which is way too big. Maybe subtract something. 3922 - (43 +29) = 3922 -72= 3850. Still way off.\n\nHmm. Let's try 43 * 53. That's 2279. Then subtract 74*29=2146. 2279 - 2146 = 133. Not helpful. Wait, maybe the other way around: 74*29=2146, subtract 43*53=2279. That would be negative. No.\n\nWhat about 74 * 8 = 592. 638 -592=46. But 8 isn't in the numbers. Wait, 53 - 43=10. 74*10=740. 740 - 29=711. Not 638.\n\nAlternatively, 43 + 53=96. 96 * 6=576. 638-576=62. 62 can be made with 74-12, but 12 isn't here. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps (74 + 53) = 127. Then 127 *5=635. Close to 638. Then 635 +3=638. But 3 isn't here. Alternatively, 127*5 +3. But the numbers left would be 29 and 43. Maybe 127*5 is 635. 635 +3=638. Where can 3 come from? 43 - 29=14, which is 14. So 14 is available, but not 3. Alternatively, 43/29 is about 1.48. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (43 * 29) = 1247. Then 1247 - (something) =638. 1247 - 638=609. So need 609 from 74 and 53. 74+53=127. 609 is way bigger. Not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps using division in a way that scales. For example, (74 * (53 - (43 -29))). Let's compute inside the parentheses: 43-29=14. Then 53-14=39. Then 74*39=2886. That's way over.\n\nAnother approach: Let's think of 638 as 600 +38. How can we get 600 from some combination, then 38 from the remaining.\n\n600 could be 43*14. But 14 is not here. Alternatively, 53*11.3. Not helpful. Wait, 74*8=592. 592 is close to 600. 74*8 +8=600. But 8 isn't here. Alternatively, 53*11=583. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, 29*21=609. That's close. 609 - 29=580. Not helpful. Maybe 53*12=636. 53*12 is 636. 636 is close to 638. Then 636 +2=638. But how to get 12 and 2. Maybe (74 - 43 -29)=2. Because 74-43=31, 31-29=2. Then 53*12=636. Wait, but where does 12 come from? Maybe 43-31=12. Wait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, 53*12=636. 12 can be made as (74 - (43 +29)). Wait, 43+29=72. 74-72=2. Then 53*2=106. 106*6=636? Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of 638 as 53*12 + 2. Wait, but again the 12 and 2. Alternatively, maybe 53*(43 - 29) +74. Let's compute: 43-29=14. 53*14=742. 742 +74=816. No, that's too much. 742-74=668. Still not 638.\n\nWait, 53*(43 - 29) -74. 53*14=742. 742-74=668. Not 638. Hmm.\n\nHow about 74* (53 -43) +29. 53-43=10. 74*10=740. 740+29=769. No. 740-29=711. No.\n\nAlternatively, 43*(29 + 53) -74. Let's see: 29+53=82. 43*82=3526. 3526-74=3452. Nope.\n\nWait, 43*(something). Let's think. 43*14=602. 602 +36=638. 36 can be 74-38. Wait, 74-38=36. But 38 is not here. Alternatively, 53- (74/ something). Wait, 74 divided by 2 is 37. Then 53-37=16. 602+16=618. Not 638.\n\nAlternatively, 43*15=645. 645-7=638. 7 can be 53-46, but 46 isn't here. Alternatively, 74-67=7. Not helpful. Hmm.\n\nWait another angle: 638 divided by 43 is approximately 14.83. Let me check 43*14.83=638. So maybe 43 multiplied by something close to 14.83. Let's see if the remaining numbers can make 14.83. 29, 74, 53. Maybe (74 +53)/ (something). 74+53=127. 127 / 29≈4.379. Not 14.83. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 53 - (74/29). Let's compute 74/29≈2.5517. Then 53 -2.5517≈50.4483. Then 43*50.4483≈2169. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 53 + (74/29). 74/29≈2.5517. 53+2.5517≈55.5517. 43*55.5517≈2388. Again way over.\n\nHmm. Maybe using subtraction in a clever way. Let's think of 74*53=3922. Then subtract (43*29)=1247. 3922-1247=2675. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 53*29=1537. 1537 - (74*43)=1537-3182= -1645. Nope.\n\nWait, maybe division. 74/(something) multiplied by something else. Let's try 74/(53 -43) =74/10=7.4. Then 7.4*29=214.6. Then 214.6 + something=638. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 53/(43-29)=53/14≈3.7857. Then 3.7857*74≈280. So 280 + something. 638-280=358. 358 can be made with 29*12.34. But 12.34 isn't here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (74 + 53) * (43 -29). That's 127*14=1778. Way over.\n\nWait, 638 is 638. Let me factor 638 to see possible components. Let's divide 638 by 2: 319. 319 is a prime? Let's check: 319 divided by 11 is 29. So 638=2*11*29. Oh! Wait, 2*11*29=638. But do we have 2, 11, and 29? We have 29, but the other numbers are 43,74,53. Hmm. So maybe 29*(something). Let's see: 638=29*22. So 29*22=638. So if I can make 22 from 43,74,53. How?\n\n22 can be 74 - 53 + something. 74-53=21. 21 +1=22. Where to get 1? Maybe 43-43=0, but we can't reuse numbers. Alternatively, 43/43=1, but again, can't reuse. Wait, but we need to use all numbers. So if we have 74,53,43, and 29, and need to make 638=29*22, then 22 must be made from 74,53,43. Let's see: 74 -53=21. 21 + (43/x)=22. So 43/x=1, so x=43. But that would require 43/43=1, which uses 43 twice. Not allowed.\n\nAlternatively, 53 - (74 -43)=53-31=22. Yes! 53 - (74 -43)=53 -31=22. Then 29*22=638. Let me check:\n\nFirst, 74-43=31. Then 53-31=22. Then 29*22=638. So putting that together:\n\n29 * (53 - (74 -43)) = 29*(53-31)=29*22=638. That uses all numbers: 29, 53,74,43. Each exactly once. Operations: -, -, *. But do the parentheses matter? Let me write the equation properly. The equation would be 29 * (53 - (74 - 43)) = 638. Let's verify:\n\n74 -43 =31.\n\n53 -31=22.\n\n29*22=638. Yes, that works! So the equation is 29*(53 - (74 -43)) =638. Let's check if all numbers are used once: 29,53,74,43. Yes. All used. Operations: subtraction inside the parentheses and multiplication. So that's the correct equation.\n</think>\n\n<answer>29 * (53 - (74 - 43))</answer>"}]}

I need to use all the numbers 50, 32, 24, and 19 exactly once each with basic arithmetic operations to get 24. Hmm. Let me start by thinking about possible combinations. Maybe I can subtract some numbers to get close. Let's try 50 minus 32. That gives 18. Then I have 24 and 19 left. Hmm, 18 plus (24 minus 19) is 18 + 5 = 23. Not quite.\n\nWait, what if I do 32 minus 19? That's 13. Then 50 divided by something. If I do 50 divided by (32 - 19), that's 50/13 which is about 3.846. Then multiply by 24? No, that would be 92.3, which is way over. Not helpful.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe combine 24 and 19 first. 24 - 19 = 5. Then 50 - 32 = 18. 18 + 5 = 23. Still one short. Hmm. Close but not there.\n\nWhat if I use division in a different way. Let's see, 50 divided by something. For example, 50/(32 - (24 -19)). Let's compute that denominator: 24-19=5, then 32-5=27. So 50/27 is approximately 1.85. Not helpful. If I multiply by something else, but I have to use all numbers.\n\nWait, maybe 32 divided by something. Let's see: 32/(50 - (24 +19)). Wait, 24 +19 is 43, 50 -43=7. 32/7 is about 4.57. Then multiplied by... but I have no numbers left. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 50 - (32 + 24). That's 50 -56 = -6. Then -6 +19=13. Not 24.\n\nWhat about 19 multiplied by something. 19*2=38, but not sure. Let's see. If I can get 24 from 50, 32, and 24. Wait, 50 - 32 =18. 18 +24=42. Then 42-19=23. Still not. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe use division. Like (50 - 32) * (24 / 19). 50-32=18, 24/19≈1.263. 18*1.263≈22.73. Close but not exact. Maybe parentheses in a different way.\n\nAlternatively, (50 - (32 / 24)) * 19. Let's compute 32/24≈1.333. 50 -1.333≈48.666. Then 48.666*19≈924.66. Way too big.\n\nWait, maybe (50 + 32) divided by something. 50+32=82. Then 82 divided by (24 -19)=82/5=16.4. Not 24.\n\nHmm. Let's try using multiplication and subtraction. 24 is the target. Let's think of factors. 24 can be 6*4, 8*3, 12*2, etc. Let's see if we can get those.\n\nFor example, 32 - 8 =24. How to get 8 from 50, 24, 19. Maybe 50 - (24 +19)=50-43=7. Not 8. Close. Alternatively, 19 - (50-24)=19-26=-7. No. \n\nWait, 32 - (50 / (19 - (24 / something))) Hmm. This is getting complicated. Maybe 24 can be achieved by (50 - 32) + (24 -19). Wait, that's 18 +5=23. Still one short.\n\nWait, what if we do 50 - (32 - (24 -19))? Let's compute: 24-19=5, 32-5=27, 50-27=23. Not 24.\n\nAlternatively, 50 - 32 +24 -19. That's 50-32=18, +24=42, -19=23. Same as before.\n\nWait, maybe (50 * 24) / (32 +19). Let's compute numerator: 50*24=1200. Denominator:32+19=51. 1200/51≈23.53. Close but not exact. Not 24.\n\nAlternatively, (32 * 24) / (50 -19). 32*24=768, 50-19=31. 768/31≈24.774. Still not exactly 24. Hmm.\n\nWait, 32*(50 -24)/19. Let's see: 50-24=26, 32*26=832, 832/19≈43.789. No.\n\nAnother angle: 24 is the target. Let's see if we can have 24 as part of the equation. Maybe 24 * (something) =24, so that something is 1. For example, 24*(50-32-19). Let's compute 50-32=18, 18-19=-1. So 24*(-1)= -24. Not 24. But if I subtract that: 24 - (50-32-19). Wait, 50-32=18, 18-19=-1. So 24 - (-1) =25. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 24 / ( (50 -32)/ (19) ). Let's compute denominator:50-32=18, 18/19≈0.947. 24/0.947≈25.34. Not 24.\n\nHmm. Maybe using subtraction and division. Let's try (50 - (32 / (24 -19))). Compute 24-19=5. 32/5=6.4. 50 -6.4=43.6.

So something would need to be 18. But I have only 19 left. Hmm, 19 can't be used again. Wait, already used 24,19,50,32. Wait, in this case, 50/(5) uses 50,24,19. Then 32 - x +10. But x would have to be 18, but I don't have 18. The numbers left are 32 and then... but maybe that's not the right path.\n\nAnother thought: 19 + (something) =24. Then something is 5. How to get 5 from 50,32,24. 32 -27=5, but how to get 27 from 50 and 24. 50-24=26. Close. Not 27. Alternatively, 24 -19=5. But I used 19 already. Wait, maybe 50/(32- something). 50/(32 - x)=5. Then 32 -x=10, so x=22. But we have 24 and 19. 24-2=22. Not helpful. Maybe 50/(32 - (24 -19))=50/(32-5)=50/27≈1.85. Then add 19? 1.85 +19=20.85. Not 24.\n\nHmm. Maybe 32 - (50 / (24 -19)) as before. 50/(5)=10. 32-10=22. Then 22 + something? But we have only 24 left. 22 +24=46. No. But we can't use 24 again. Wait, all numbers must be used. So in that scenario, 50,24,19 are used in 50/(24-19), then 32 is used in 32 - (that). Then where's the 24? We haven't used it. Wait, no, that's right. If I do 32 - (50/(24-19)) then that uses 32,50,24,19. So all four numbers. Then the result is 22. Not 24. So that's not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe (50 - 24) / (32 -19). 50-24=26. 32-19=13. 26/13=2. Then 2 multiplied by something? But I already used all numbers.\n\nAlternatively, ((50 -24) * (32 -19)) / something. 50-24=26, 32-19=13. 26*13=338. Divided by what? But I've already used all numbers. Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe 50 - (32 + (24 -19)). Let's compute 24-19=5. 32+5=37. 50-37=13. Nope.\n\nAnother idea: 19 * (something) =24. 24/19 ≈1.263. How to get that from 50 and 32. Maybe (50 -32)/something. 50-32=18. 18/ (something) ≈1.263. So 18 / x =1.263, so x≈14.25. But 14.25 from 24? 24-9.75=14.25? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, 32/(50 - (24 +19)). 50-43=7. 32/7≈4.57. Then 4.57*19≈86.86. No.\n\nWait, let's think of 24 as (a - b) * (c - d). Let me try to pair them. Let's see possible pairs.\n\n50-32=18, 24-19=5. 18*5=90. No. 18/5=3.6. 18+5=23. 18-5=13. Not 24.\n\n50-24=26, 32-19=13. 26/13=2. 26*13=338. 26+13=39. 26-13=13. Not helpful.\n\n50-19=31, 32-24=8. 31*8=248. 31/8=3.875. 31+8=39. 31-8=23. Hmm, 23 is close. If we do 31-8=23. Then add 1? But no numbers left.\n\nWait, 50/ (something) =24. 50 divided by approximately 2.083. How to get 2.083 from 32,24,19. 32/(24 -19)=32/5=6.4. 50/6.4=7.8125. Not helpful.\n\nHmm. Maybe 32 - (something) =24. So that something is 8. How to get 8 from 50,24,19. Let's see. 24 - (19 - (50- something)). Not sure. Alternatively, 50 - (24 +19)=50-43=7. Close to 8 but not quite. 7+1=8, but where's the 1?\n\nAlternatively, 24 / (19 - (50 -32)). Let's compute inside the parentheses:50-32=18. 19-18=1. 24/1=24. Oh! Wait, that might work. Let me check:\n\n24 / (19 - (50 -32)) \n\nCompute step by step:\n\nFirst, 50-32=18.\n\nThen, 19-18=1.\n\nThen, 24 /1=24.\n\nYes! So that uses all numbers: 50,32 in (50-32), then 19 and 24. So the equation is 24 / (19 - (50 - 32)) =24. Let's verify:\n\n50-32=18\n\n19-18=1\n\n24/1=24. Perfect!\n\nSo the equation is 24 / (19 - (50 - 32)) which simplifies to 24 / (19 - 18) =24/1=24. And all numbers are used once: 50,32,24,19.\n</think>\n\n<answer>24 / (19 - (50 - 32))</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using the numbers 43, 32, 1, and 98, each exactly once, and the result should be 24. The operations allowed are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Hmm, how do I approach this?\n\nFirst, maybe I should list out all the numbers and think about possible combinations. Let's see. The numbers are 43, 32, 1, 98. All are different, so each has to be used once. The target is 24. Since 24 is a relatively small number compared to some of these numbers, I might need to use division or subtraction to reduce larger numbers.\n\nLet me think about possible operations. Let's start with the largest number, 98. If I subtract something from 98 to get close to 24, but 98 minus something. Let's see: 98 - 43 = 55. That's still too big. 98 -32=66, still big. 98 - (43+32) = 98 -75=23. Oh, that's close. Wait, 23 is just 1 less than 24. But I still have the 1 left. Hmm, maybe 98 - (43 +32) +1? That would be 98-75=23, 23+1=24. Wait, but then I have used 98,43,32,1. Yes! Let me check that: 98 -43 -32 +1. Let's compute that. 98-43 is 55. 55-32 is 23. 23+1=24. That works! Wait, but the way the parentheses would be? Let me write it properly.\n\nSo the equation would be (98 -43 -32) +1. But order of operations would require that subtraction is left associative, so maybe 98 -43 -32 +1. Let's check again: 98 minus 43 is 55, minus 32 is 23, plus 1 is 24. Yes! That uses all four numbers: 98,43,32,1 each once. So the equation is 98 -43 -32 +1 =24.\n\nWait, but the problem allows using operations multiple times but each number once. So in this case, the operations are subtraction, subtraction, and addition. All numbers are used once. That seems to fit. Let me verify:\n\n98 -43 =55; 55-32=23; 23+1=24. Yes, that's correct. So the equation is 98 -43 -32 +1 =24. But how to write it with parentheses? Well, since subtraction and addition are left associative, maybe it's okay without parentheses, but perhaps grouping to make it clearer. Alternatively, maybe (98 - (43 +32)) +1. Let's see, 43+32=75. 98-75=23, then 23+1=24. So that's another way. So the equation would be (98 - (43 +32)) +1. But using parentheses here groups the 43 and 32. Either way, both expressions are valid. Let me check if that's acceptable.\n\nThe problem says we can use the operations one or multiple times. So using three operations: two subtractions and one addition, but since the numbers are used once each. So either way, the equation works. But perhaps the second way with parentheses is better for clarity. Let me write it as (98 - (43 +32)) +1. That uses all numbers, each once. Let me check again: 43+32=75. 98-75=23. 23+1=24. Correct. So that's the equation. Alternatively, without parentheses, but order of operations would still give the same result. However, using parentheses makes it clearer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another combination. Let me think again. Let's see if there's another approach. For example, using division or multiplication. Maybe 32 divided by something. 32 divided by (something) gives a number that could be part of 24. But not sure. Let me try.\n\nSuppose I try 43 - (98 / something). 98 divided by, say, 32 is 3.0625. Then 43 -3.0625 is about 40, which isn't helpful. Or 98 divided by 43 is around 2.279. Then 32 minus that would be around 29.72. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 98 divided by something. Let's see. 98 divided by (32 -1) is 98/31 ≈3.161. Then 43 minus that is 39.839. Not 24. Hmm.\n\nWhat about 43 - (32 / (98 - something)). Let's see. 98 -1=97. 32/97 is about 0.33. 43 -0.33=42.67. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, (43 -32) is 11. Then 98 divided by something. 98 / (11 -1) is 98/10=9.8. 9.8 is not 24. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 98 - (43 +1) =98-44=54. Then 54 divided by 32 is 1.6875. Not 24. Doesn't work.\n\nAnother approach: 43 -32 =11. Then 11 +1=12. Then 98-12=86. No. Not helpful.\n\nWait, what if we do 43 * 1 =43. Then 98 -43=55. 55 -32=23. Still missing 1. But we already used 1 in the multiplication. So that might not work.\n\nAlternatively, 32 divided by 1=32. Then 98 -43=55. 55 -32=23. Then 23. Again, missing 1, but we used 1 already.\n\nWait, but in that case, the numbers used would be 32,1 (from division), 98,43. So all numbers are used. But 32/1=32. Then 98-43=55. 55-32=23. So 23. But we need 24. Hmm. Not quite. So maybe that's not helpful.\n\nAnother idea: 43 * (something). If 43 * (32 - 98/ something). Let's see. Let's see if 98 divided by 1 is 98. 32 -98= -66. 43*(-66)= -2838. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 43 * 1 =43. Then 98 -43=55. Then 55 -32=23. Again, same as before.\n\nWait, so maybe the initial approach where 98 -43 -32 +1 is the correct one. Let's confirm again:\n\n98 -43=55. 55-32=23. 23+1=24. Exactly. So the equation is 98-43-32+1=24.\n\nBut how to write that with parentheses? Because subtraction and addition are left associative, but perhaps the user wants the equation written with parentheses for clarity. So maybe ((98 -43) -32) +1. But that's the same as the original. Alternatively, 98 -43 -32 +1. But since all the operations are subtraction and addition, left to right, the parentheses are not necessary. But maybe the problem expects parentheses. Let me check the example given: for example, <answer>(1 + 2) / 3</answer>. So the example uses parentheses. Maybe the user expects parentheses to group operations. So perhaps (98 -43 -32) +1, but that's redundant since subtraction is left associative. Alternatively, (98 - (43 +32)) +1. That way, the 43 and 32 are grouped. Let's compute:\n\n43 +32=75. 98 -75=23. 23 +1=24. So that works. So the equation is (98 - (43 +32)) +1 =24.\n\nAlternatively, the equation can be written as 98 -43 -32 +1 =24. Either way, but the one with parentheses might be more explicit. Let's see which one uses all numbers once. Both use all numbers once. So both are valid. But perhaps the problem expects the use of parentheses even if they are not strictly necessary. Let me check the example again: (1 + 2) / 3. Even though it's not necessary to have parentheses for division, but they used it for the addition. So following the example, maybe grouping the 43 and 32 makes sense. So (98 - (43 +32)) +1.\n\nYes, that seems to fit the example's style. So I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(98 - (43 + 32)) + 1 = 24</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using the numbers 78, 14, 63, and 12 exactly once each, with basic operations, to get 167. Hmm. Let me try different combinations.\n\nFirst, I'll list out the numbers: 78, 14, 63, 12. I have to use all of them. The target is 167. Let me think about which operations might get me close.\n\n167 is a prime number, so maybe addition and subtraction are needed. Let's check the sum of all numbers: 78 + 14 + 63 + 12 = 167? Let's add them step by step. 78 +14 is 92. 92 +63 is 155. 155 +12 is 167. Wait, that's exactly 167! Wait, but that's just adding all of them. But the problem says \"create an equation that equals 167\" using each number once and all the numbers. So maybe the answer is simply 78 +14 +63 +12 =167. But wait, the example uses parentheses and operations. Let me check the problem again.\n\nThe user says to use basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) one or multiple times but each number can be used once. So maybe they require at least one operation other than addition? Because adding all numbers together would be straightforward, but perhaps that's allowed. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: \"using the numbers 78, 14, 63, 12, create an equation that equals 167. You can use basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) one or multiple times but each number can only be used once, and you must use all the numbers.\"\n\nWait, if I just add them all, that uses each number once, and all the numbers. The operations are all additions. So maybe that's acceptable. Let me confirm the sum again. 78 +14 is 92, plus 63 is 155, plus 12 is 167. So the equation is 78 +14 +63 +12 =167. That's correct. But the example given is \"(1 + 2) / 3\", which uses parentheses. So maybe the user expects some combination with different operations, but perhaps the simplest solution is just adding all numbers. Let me check if that's allowed. The problem didn't specify that you have to use multiple types of operations, just that you can use them. So if the sum works, that's okay. But maybe I'm missing something. Let me check again.\n\nWait, 78 +14 is 92, 63 +12 is 75. 92 +75 is 167. So yes, adding all four numbers gives 167. So the equation would be 78 +14 +63 +12=167. But perhaps the problem expects a more complex equation, maybe with multiplication or division? Let me see if that's possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to combine some numbers with multiplication or division to reach 167. Let's see. Let's try different combinations.\n\nFirst, let's see if any of the numbers multiplied together can get close. For example, 14 * 12 is 168, which is just 1 more than 167. Hmm, interesting. 14*12=168. If I subtract 1, that would be 167. But how can I get 1 from the remaining numbers? Wait, the remaining numbers would be 78 and 63. If I do 78 -63, that's 15. Not 1. Or 63 -78 is -15. Not helpful. Alternatively, 78/63 is approximately 1.238, which isn't helpful. Maybe 63/78 is 0.807... Not helpful. Hmm. So 14*12=168, which is 1 over. But how to get 1 from 78 and 63. Maybe 78 -63 -14? Wait, but we already used 14. No, each number can only be used once. So perhaps that approach isn't working.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of 63 * something. 63 *2 is 126. 167 -126=41. Can I make 41 from 78,14,12? Let's see. 78 -14=64. 64-12=52. Not 41. 14 +12=26. 78-26=52. Still not. Hmm.\n\nAnother approach: 78 +63=141. Then 141 +14=155. 155 +12=167. Which brings us back to the original sum. So that's just adding all numbers again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using division. For example, 78 / 12 is 6.5. Then 6.5 *14=91. 91 +63=154. Not enough. Or 63 /14=4.5. 4.5*12=54. 54 +78=132. Not close.\n\nWhat if we subtract something. For example, 78 *2=156, but we can't use 2. Wait, but 78 + (63 -14) +12. Let's compute that: 63-14=49. 78+49=127. 127+12=139. Not enough. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, 78 + (63 +14) = 78+77=155. Then 155 +12=167. Again, same as the sum.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem requires using at least one multiplication or division, but the initial sum works. Let me check the problem statement again. The user says: \"You can use basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) one or multiple times but each number can only be used once, and you must use all the numbers.\" So the operations can be used one or multiple times. So using just addition multiple times is allowed. Therefore, the answer could be 78 +14 +63 +12=167. But let me check if that's the case. However, when the user provided the example, they used parentheses, which might suggest they want an equation that combines operations, but maybe not necessarily. The example was (1 + 2) / 3, but that's a different problem. So perhaps adding all numbers is acceptable here.\n\nBut let's verify the sum again: 78 +14 is 92. 92 +63 is 155. 155 +12 is 167. Yes, that's correct. So the equation would be 78 +14 +63 +12 =167. Since all numbers are used once and only addition is used, which is allowed. Therefore, that's a valid solution. But maybe the problem is expecting that because it's straightforward, but perhaps I should check if there's another way in case that's not the intended answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different combination. Let's think: 78 -14=64. Then 64*2=128, but we don't have a 2. Alternatively, 63 +12=75. 75 +78=153. 153 +14=167. Same as before. So again, just adding all numbers.\n\nAlternatively, let's see if using subtraction can help. For example, 78 +63=141. 141 +14=155. 155 +12=167. Same as before. Alternatively, if we subtract a number and add another, but we have to use all numbers once. So maybe 78 -12=66. 66 +63=129. 129 +14=143. No. Not enough.\n\nAlternatively, 63 -14=49. 78 +49=127. 127 +12=139. Still not.\n\nWhat if we multiply two numbers. For example, 14*12=168. Then 168 - (78 -63)=168 -15=153. Not 167. Or 168 - (something). Wait, 168 is 1 over 167. So 168 -1=167. How to get 1 from 78 and 63. 78 -63=15. 15-14=1. But then we would have to use 14 again, which is already used in the multiplication. So that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, 63 - (78 / something). Let's see, 78 divided by 12 is 6.5. 63 -6.5=56.5. 56.5 *14=791. That's way too big. Not helpful.\n\nHmm. Let's try another approach. Maybe 78 + (63 -14) +12. 63-14=49. 78+49=127. 127+12=139. Not enough. What if we do 63 +14=77. 77*2=154. But again, we need a 2, which we don't have. 77 +78=155. 155 +12=167. Again, sum all.\n\nAlternatively, 78 + (63 +14 +12) = same as before.\n\nWait, perhaps the answer is indeed the simple sum. Because all numbers add up exactly to 167. Let me confirm again:\n\n78 +14 = 92\n\n92 +63 = 155\n\n155 +12 = 167\n\nYes, that's correct. Therefore, the equation is 78 +14 +63 +12 =167. Each number is used once, all operations are additions, which is allowed. So that's a valid solution.\n</think>\n\n<answer>78 + 14 + 63 + 12 = 167</answer>"}]}

Let's start by thinking about how to combine these numbers to reach that.\n\nFirst, the largest number here is 62. Maybe multiplying it by another number could get close. Let's see: 62 * 27 is 1674, which is way over. 62 * 26 is 1612, still too big. 62 * 1 is 62, which is too small. So maybe multiplication with 62 isn't the way.\n\nAlternatively, adding up the numbers: 62 + 27 + 26 +1 = 116. Way too low. So definitely need some multiplication here.\n\nWhat if I combine two numbers into a larger number via addition or multiplication, then use another operation. Let's try different combinations.\n\nLet me consider 27 and 26. Their product is 702. Then if I add 62, that's 702 +62 = 764. Wait, but then I still have to use the 1. Oh, but all numbers must be used. So that approach doesn't work. But maybe there's a way to adjust it.\n\nWait, 27 * 26 is 702. Then adding 62 gives 764. But where does the 1 come in? If I subtract 1 somewhere. Maybe 27 * 26 + 62 - 1? Let's calculate that: 702 +62 = 764, then minus 1 is 763. Not quite. Alternatively, 27*26 + (62 -1) = 702 +61=763. Still no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (27 +1) *26 +62? Let's check: 28*26 is 728, plus 62 is 790. That's over. Not helpful.\n\nWait, 26 * (27 +1) =26*28=728. Then 728 +62=790. Still no. Hmm.\n\nWhat if we subtract instead. 27*26 is 702. If we subtract 1 from 62, that's 61. Then 702 +61=763. Still no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use division in a way. For example, 62 * (27 - (26/1)). Let's see: 26/1 is 26. 27-26=1. Then 62*1=62. Not helpful.\n\nHmm, maybe using 62 and 27 in a multiplication. 62*12 is 744, but how to get 12 from 27,26,1. Wait, 27 - (26 -1)= 27-25=2. 62*(27 - (26 -1))=62*2=124. Not helpful.\n\nWait, 62*(27) is 1674, which is too big, but maybe subtract something. 1674 - (26* something). Let's see, 1674 - (26*35) would be 1674-910=764. But how to get 35 from 26 and 1. Wait, 26 + 1=27. Hmm. No. Or 26*1=26. So 35 isn't achievable here. Alternatively, 1674 - (26 +1)=1674-27=1647. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 62*(26 +1) =62*27=1674. Still too big.\n\nWait, maybe (62 +27) * something. 62+27=89. 89*8=712. Not enough. 89*9=801. Too big. So 89*8.5=756.5. Hmm, but fractions. Let's see if we can get 8.5 from 26 and 1. Maybe 26/ (1+1) but we can't reuse 1. Wait, 26 / something. If I do 26/(1) =26. Then 89*26=2314. Way too big.\n\nAlternatively, 89 -26=63. 63* something. Not helpful.\n\nWhat if we use 62*12. Let me check 62*12=744. 744 is close to 764. Then 764-744=20. How to get 20 from 27,26,1. Hmm, 26 - (27 -1)=26-26=0. Not helpful. Or 27 - (26/1)=1. Then 744+1=745. Not 764.\n\nAlternatively, 62*13=806. That's over. 806 - (something) to reach 764. 806-42=764. How to get 42 from 27,26,1. 27+26=53. 53-1=52. Not 42. Not helpful.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe use division to create a fraction that can be multiplied. For example, 62*(27 + (26/1)). Let's compute: 26/1=26. 27+26=53. 62*53=3286. That's way over.\n\nHmm, maybe subtract a large number. Let's see: 62*27=1674. Then subtract 26* something. Let's say 1674 - (26*35)=1674-910=764. Wait, that's exactly what we need. But how do we get 35 from the remaining numbers. The remaining numbers would be 26 and 1, but 26 and 1. Wait, 26 +1=27. Not 35. So that doesn't work.\n\nWait, but the numbers to use are 62,27,26,1. So if we do 62*27 - 26* something=764. Let's rearrange: 62*27 -764=26x. Compute 62*27=1674. 1674-764=910. So 26x=910. So x=910/26=35. But how to get 35 from 1 and 26. No, that's impossible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use 62* something else. Let's try different combinations.\n\nHow about 26*27=702. Then 702 +62=764. But then we need to use the 1. Maybe 702 +62 +1=765. No. Or 702 + (62 -1)=763. Not 764.\n\nWait, 26*27 is 702. Then adding 62 gives 764. So 26*27 +62=764. But where does the 1 come in? Oh, wait, if we can use the 1 in a way that doesn't affect the equation. Maybe by multiplying by 1. But 26*27*1 +62=764. That works! Let's check: 26*27 is 702. Multiply by 1 is still 702. 702 +62=764. Yes! And all numbers are used once: 26,27,1,62. So the equation is 26*27*1 +62=764.\n\nBut wait, is there a more concise way? Like (26*27) +62*1. But same thing. So either way, the equation would be (26 × 27 × 1) + 62 = 764. Alternatively, 26*27 +62*1. That uses all numbers once. Let me verify:\n\n26 *27 =702. 702 +62=764. Then the 1 is used as multiplying by 1, which is allowed. So the equation is (26 * 27 * 1) +62 =764. But since multiplication by 1 is redundant, maybe write it as (26*27) +62 +1? No, that would be 702+62+1=765. Not correct. So no, the correct way is to include the 1 in the multiplication. So 26*27*1 +62=764.\n\nYes, that uses all numbers. Let me check again: 26,27,1 are multiplied together, and then add 62. 26*27=702. 702*1=702. 702 +62=764. Exactly. So the equation is (26*27*1) +62=764. Alternatively, (26×27×1)+62=764. That works.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(26 * 27 * 1) + 62 = 764</answer>"}]}

Wait, that can't work because 46 is less than 72. So maybe adding first. Or maybe 46 plus another number, then subtract something. Let's try 46 + 43 = 89. Then 89 - (12 + 8) = 89 - 20 = 69. Not 72. Close. Maybe different combination.\n\nWhat about 43 + 8 = 51. Then 51 * something. But we need to use all numbers. Wait, maybe multiplication and division. Let's see, 46 divided by something. 46 divided by 12 is about 3.83, which doesn't help much. 12 times 6 is 72, but how to get 6 from the other numbers. Let's see: 43 - (46 -8) = 43 -38=5. Not 6. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, 12 * (something) =72. So if I can get 6, because 12*6=72. How to get 6 from 43, 8, 46. Let's see: 46 - 43 =3, then 8 -3=5. Not 6. Or 8 +3=11. Not helpful. Maybe (46 -43) +8=11. Still not 6. Alternatively, 8 - (46-43)=8-3=5. Not 6.\n\nHmm, maybe another approach. Let's think of 72 as 8*9. So if I can get 9 from 43,46,12. Let's see. 43 - (46 -12) =43 -34=9. Yes! So 43 - (46 -12) =9. Then multiply by 8: 8*9=72. So that uses all numbers: 8, 43, 46,12. Let me check:\n\n(43 - (46 -12)) *8 = (43 -34)*8 =9*8=72. Yes! That works.

Oh, wait! That gives me 2. So maybe combine these ideas. So if I take (34 / 17) and then multiply or add it to (65 - 65). But 65-65 is zero, so adding would just give 2, but wait, but then the equation would be (34 /17) + (65 -65) = 2 +0=2. But does that use all numbers? Let's check: 34,17,65,65. Yes. Each used once. So that would be (34 / 17) + (65 - 65) = 2. Let me verify: 34 divided by 17 is 2, and 65 minus 65 is 0. So 2 +0=2. Perfect! That uses all four numbers once each. Alternatively, maybe another arrangement. Let me see if there's another way, but this seems to work. Let me check if I can write this as an equation: (34 / 17) + (65 -65) = 2. Yep. That's correct.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(34 / 17) + (65 - 65) = 2</answer>"}]}

All numbers must be used once, and I can only use basic arithmetic operations. Hmm, let's start by looking at the numbers. The biggest number here is 780, which is pretty close to 978. If I can figure out how to get the remaining 198 using the other numbers: 27, 90, and 81. \n\nSo 978 minus 780 is 198. So maybe I need to create 198 with 27, 90, and 81. Let me see. Let's check what 27 + 90 + 81 equals. That's 27+90=117, plus 81=198. Oh! That's exactly 198. So if I add all three of those numbers together and then add that sum to 780, I should get 978. \n\nWait, but the problem says I have to use each number exactly once, and all of them. So if I do 780 + (27 + 90 + 81) = 780 + 198 = 978. That works! Let me check again. 27+90=117, 117+81=198. Then 780+198=978. Yes, that seems right.\n\nBut let me make sure that this is allowed. The operations are addition, and the numbers are each used once. So the equation would be 780 + 27 + 90 + 81 = 978. But wait, that's using all four numbers. 780 is one number, and then 27, 90, 81 are the others. So yes, all four numbers are used once. That should be the equation. Let me verify:\n\n780 + 27 = 807\n807 + 90 = 897\n897 + 81 = 978. Yep, that adds up correctly. \n\nSo the equation is 780 + 27 + 90 + 81 = 978. But the problem might require parentheses or a specific order? Wait, the example they gave was (1 + 2) / 3. So maybe they want an equation with operations grouped, but in this case, addition is associative, so maybe it's okay as is. Alternatively, maybe there's another way that combines operations, but the simplest way is just adding them all together. Let me check if there's a need to use other operations to make it more complex. \n\nAlternatively, maybe using subtraction or multiplication. Let me think. Suppose I try to do 780 plus (something), but maybe using multiplication. For example, 90 * 81 is a huge number, 7290, which is way too big. 27*90=2430, also too big. 27*81=2187. 780 divided by something? 780/27 is about 28.89, which doesn't help. 780/90=8.666... Not helpful. 780/81≈9.63. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe subtract some numbers. Let's see: 780 + (90 - 27) * 81. Wait, 90-27=63, 63*81=5103, which is way over. Not useful.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe 90 * (something) plus or minus others. Let's see. If I take 90*27=2430. Then 2430 - 780=1650. Then subtract 81: 1650-81=1569. Not helpful. Alternatively, 90*10=900, but 10 isn't a number here. Maybe 90*(81/27) =90*3=270. Then 270 +780=1050. Then subtract 90? Wait, but we already used 90. No, can't reuse. Hmm. Wait, if 90*(81/27) = 270, and then add 780: 270+780=1050. Then subtract 72 (but 72 isn't one of the numbers). Wait, maybe 1050 - (something). But we need to use all numbers. So perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, 780 + (81 - 27) * something. 81-27=54. 54*90=4860. 780+4860=5640, way too big. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 780 - (90 +81 +27). 780 - 198=582. Not helpful. \n\nAnother thought: Maybe division. Let's see. 780 divided by something. For example, 780/27≈28.89. If I multiply that by 90, that's 28.89*90=2600.1, which is too big. Not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, 90*(81 +27) =90*108=9720. Then 9720 divided by 780=12.46. Not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, 780 + 90 =870. Then 870 + 81=951. Then 951 +27=978. So that's the same as just adding all numbers. So the equation is simply 780 +90 +81 +27=978. But since the order doesn't matter in addition, maybe the answer is just that. However, the problem might expect some grouping. Let me check the example they gave: (1 + 2)/3. So perhaps they want parentheses even if not necessary. But in this case, since addition is associative, parentheses aren't required. But maybe the answer can be written as (780 + 27) + (90 +81) =978. But that's also valid. Alternatively, the user might accept the equation without parentheses. Let me check the problem statement. It says \"create an equation that equals 978\" using the numbers with each used once and all operations allowed. The example uses parentheses, but perhaps the answer can be written as a sum. However, the problem might require that the equation uses operations other than just addition. Wait, but addition is allowed. The user specified \"basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) one or multiple times\". So using all additions is acceptable. Therefore, the equation would be 27 +90 +81 +780=978. Let me verify again: 27+90=117, 117+81=198, 198+780=978. Yes. Correct. \n\nBut maybe the user expects some combination of operations. Let me check if that's possible. For example, maybe 780 + (90 - (81 -27)). Let's compute that. 81-27=54. 90-54=36. 780+36=816. Not 978. No. \n\nAlternatively, 90 * 27 + 780 -81. Let's calculate that: 90*27=2430. 2430+780=3210. 3210-81=3129. Way too big. \n\nAnother idea: 780 + (81 * (90 / 27)). Let's compute: 90/27=10/3≈3.333. 81*3.333≈270. 780+270=1050. Then subtract 72, but we don't have 72. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, (780 - 90) * (81 /27). Let's see: 780-90=690. 81/27=3. 690*3=2070. Not helpful. \n\nAnother approach: Maybe using division to create fractions. For example, 780 + (90 * 81)/27. Let's calculate: 90*81=7290. 7290/27=270. 780+270=1050. Again, not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, (780 / 27) +90 +81. 780/27≈28.89. 28.89+90=118.89+81≈200. Still not 978. \n\nWait, maybe subtract something. Let's see: 90 * 81 =7290. 7290 -780=6510. Then 6510 -27=6483. No. Not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, 780* something. 780*1.25=975, but we need 978. Close, but how to get that 1.25. Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, 780 + (90 +81) -27. 90+81=171. 780+171=951. 951-27=924. No. \n\nHmm. It seems that the only way to reach 978 is by adding all four numbers. Let me confirm once more:\n\n27 + 90 +81 +780 = 27+90=117; 117+81=198; 198+780=978. Yes. All numbers used once. All operations are additions. So the equation is correct. Therefore, the answer is 27 +90 +81 +780=978. But the problem requires putting the equation in answer tags. So I should write <answer>27 + 90 + 81 + 780 = 978</answer> but according to the example, the equation is within the answer tags without the equals sign and the result. Wait, the example was <answer>(1 + 2) / 3</answer>, which is just the expression. So maybe I need to present the left-hand side expression that equals 978. So like <answer>27 + 90 + 81 + 780</answer> because when evaluated, it equals 978. Let me check the problem statement again. It says \"create an equation that equals 978\". So perhaps the equation is \"27 +90 +81 +780=978\", but the example shows just the expression. Wait, the example is (1 + 2)/3, which is the expression that equals the desired result. So perhaps the answer should be the expression that evaluates to 978, without the =978 part. Let me check the user's instruction: \"Return the final equation in <answer> </answer> tags, for example <answer>(1 + 2) / 3</answer>\". So in the example, the equation is just the expression that equals the result. So in this case, the expression would be 27 +90 +81 +780. Therefore, the answer is <answer>27 + 90 + 81 + 780</answer>. \n\nBut let me make sure. Let's confirm: The user provided example was for creating an equation that equals the target, and the example answer was just the expression. So yes, the answer should be the expression that when calculated equals 978. So the correct answer is adding all four numbers together. Therefore, the final equation is 27 +90 +81 +780.\n</think>\n\n<answer>27 + 90 + 81 + 780</answer>"}]}

Wait, so if I can get 65 from the other numbers, then multiplying by 9 would work. Let me check. The remaining numbers are 49, 91, and 23. How can I combine these to get 65? Let's see:\n\n91 minus 49 is 42. 42 plus 23 is 65. Oh! Wait, 91 - 49 = 42, then 42 + 23 = 65. So if I do (91 - 49 + 23) and then multiply by 9, that would be 65 * 9 = 585. Let me verify:\n\n91 minus 49 is 42. 42 plus 23 is 65. Multiply by 9 gives 585. Yes! So the equation would be (91 - 49 + 23) * 9. Let me check if all numbers are used once: 91, 49, 23, and 9.

Alright, let's start by thinking about possible combinations.\n\nFirst, 47 is a prime number, so maybe subtraction or division could help here. Let me try to pair some numbers and see.\n\nLet me try 95 and 48 first. If I subtract 48 from 95, that's 47. Oh, wait, 95 - 48 is 47. But then I still have 60 and 61 left. How can I incorporate those? Because I have to use all numbers. Hmm. Maybe I can set up an equation where the other two numbers cancel out or result in 1, so that 47 * 1 = 47. For example, (95 - 48) * (60 / 60) but wait, 60 is already used once, and I need to use 61 instead. Wait, can't do that. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 61 - 60 is 1. So if I have (95 - 48) + (61 - 60) that would be 47 + 1 = 48, which is not helpful. But maybe subtract that 1 instead: (95 - 48) - (61 - 60) = 47 -1 = 46. Not quite. Hmm.\n\nWhat if I use division? For example, 60 divided by something. Let's see. 60 divided by (something) to get a number that when combined with others gives 47. Alternatively, maybe 95 minus something. Let's try 95 - (48 + 60/61). Let's compute that. 60/61 is approximately 0.9836. 48 + 0.9836 is 48.9836. 95 minus that is about 46.016, which is close to 47 but not exactly. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 61 - (something with the other numbers). Let's see. 61 - (95 - 48) is 61 -47 =14. Then 14 and 60 left. Not helpful. Maybe multiply? 14 * (60/ something).

Not 47. Close, but no.\n\nWhat if I do 95 - 48 =47. Then I have 60 and 61 left. How to combine them into 0? Because 47 +0=47. But 60-60 is 0, but I can't use 60 twice. Alternatively, 61 -60=1. So maybe (95-48) - (61-60) =47 -1=46. Not helpful. But if I could multiply by 1. Maybe (95-48)*(61-60)=47*1=47. Wait, that might work. Let me check.\n\nYes! 95 minus 48 is 47. Then 61 minus 60 is 1. Multiply them together: 47*1=47. Wait, but that would be (95 -48)*(61-60). Does that use all four numbers? Let's see: 95,48,61,60. Yes, all used once. So the equation is (95 -48)*(61 -60) =47*1=47.

Let's start by thinking about possible combinations.\n\nFirst, maybe I should look for pairs that can multiply or divide to get closer to 270. Let's check the numbers: 98 and 49 are both larger numbers, so maybe combining them could help. Wait, 49 is half of 98. So 98 divided by 49 is 2. But 2 multiplied by something else... Hmm, maybe not. Let's see, 98 minus 49 is 49. Then 49 plus 54 is 103, plus 10 is 113. That's way too low. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe multiply 98 and 54 first. 98*54 is a big number. Let me calculate that: 98*50 is 4900, plus 98*4=392, so 4900+392=5292. That's way larger than 270. Maybe divide that by something. If I divide 5292 by 49, that's 5292 ÷49. Let me compute that: 49*100=4900, so 5292-4900=392. 392 ÷49=8. So total is 100+8=108. So 98*54/49=108. Then 108*10=1080. That's over. But I have to use all numbers. Wait, I used 98,54,49, and 10.

Then 2 multiplied by 54 is 108, then 108 times 10 is 1080 again. Same result. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe subtract something. Let's see. What if I take 98 and 10? 98-10=88. Then 88* something. Let's see, 88*3=264, which is close to 270. But how to get 3 from 49 and 54? 54-49=5. Not 3. Alternatively, 54/ something. 54 divided by 18 is 3. But where do I get 18? Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe another approach. Let's look at 54. 54 times 5 is 270. So if I can get 5 from the other numbers. Let's see. The other numbers are 98, 49, 10. How to get 5? 49 divided by something. 49 divided by 9.8 is 5. But 9.8 is 98 divided by 10. So, 49 ÷ (98/10) = 49 ÷9.8 =5. Then 54*5=270. So putting that together: 54 * (49 ÷ (98/10)) = 270. Let's check that. 98 divided by 10 is 9.8. 49 divided by 9.8 is 5. Then 54*5 is 270. Yes! So that uses all numbers: 54, 49, 98, 10. Each once.

The operations are division inside the parentheses first: 98 divided by 10, then 49 divided by that result, then multiplied by 54. So the equation is (54 * (49 / (98 / 10))). Let's check the calculation again step by step. 98 /10 =9.8. Then 49 /9.8=5. Then 54*5=270. Yep, that works. All numbers used once.

But maybe subtract something from that? Let's see. 754 minus something... Let's see, 754 - 337 = 417. So I need to get 417 using 24 and 15. Wait, 24*15 is 360. 754 - 360 is 394. Not 337. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 29 multiplied by something else. Let's think. 29*24 is 696. Then subtract 26 and 15? 696 -26 = 670, minus 15 is 655. Still not close. What if I divide? 29*(24 - something). Not sure.\n\nWait, 337 is close to 340, which is 26*13. But how? Maybe 26*13 is 338, which is one more than 337. But I don't have 13. Alternatively, 26*12 is 312, plus 25 would be 337, but I don't have 25. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe combine 24 and 15 first. 24 +15=39. Then 29*39=1131. That's way over. 29-26=3, then 3*24*15=1080, still way too big.\n\nWait, maybe I need to use subtraction and multiplication together. Let's think. Suppose I do 26*15, which is 390. Then subtract something. 390 - (29 +24) = 390 -53=337. Wait, that works! Let me check that again. 26*15 is 390. Then subtract 29 and 24. So 26*15 -29 -24. Let's compute that: 390 -29=361, then 361-24=337. Yes! But wait, have I used all numbers? 26,15,29,24. Yes, each used once. And the operations are multiplication and subtractions. So that works. So the equation would be 26*15 -29 -24 =337. Let me verify again:\n\n26 multiplied by 15 is 390. Then subtract 29: 390-29=361. Subtract 24: 361-24=337. Exactly. So that should be the correct equation.\n</think>\n\n<answer>26 * 15 - 29 - 24 = 337</answer>"}]}

I need to make an equation using the numbers 22, 272, 6, and 77, each exactly once, and combine them with basic operations to get 946. Hmm. Let's start by thinking about the target number, 946. Let me break that down. Maybe 946 is close to some multiples of the numbers given.\n\nFirst, looking at 272. If I multiply that by something. Let's see: 272 * 3 is 816, which is too low. 272 * 4 is 1088, which is higher than 946. So maybe 272 * 3.5? But that's not an integer. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe subtract something from 272*3.5? Not sure.\n\nWait, 272 is a big number. Let me see if I can use that with another number. Let's see, 272 plus 22 is 294. That's not helpful. 272 minus 22 is 250. 272 divided by 22 is about 12.36. Maybe not.\n\nWhat if I multiply 272 by 6? 272*6=1632. That's way higher than 946. Hmm. Maybe 272*3.5? Wait, 3.5 would need 7 divided by 2, but we don't have a 2 except in 22. Maybe 6 can be used somehow.\n\nAlternatively, maybe combine 77 and 6. 77*6=462. Then, what's left is 22 and 272. If I add 462 to 272, that's 734. Then add 22? 734+22=756. Not enough. Hmm. Maybe subtract? 272 - 22 = 250. 250 + 462=712. Still not 946.\n\nWait, maybe multiply 272 by 3. Let's see, 272*3=816. How do I get 816 to 946? 946-816=130. So I need to make 130 using 22, 77, and 6. Wait, but I already used 272 and 6? No, wait, if I used 272*3, but where does the 3 come from? Because the available numbers are 22, 272, 6, 77. So maybe I need to use each once. So perhaps 272 * (something) plus or minus something else.\n\nWait, let's think of 272 * 3.5 again. But how to get 3.5 from the remaining numbers. 77 divided by 22 is 3.5. Oh! 77/22 is exactly 3.5. So 272*(77/22) = 272*3.5 = 952. Hmm, that's close to 946. 952 - 6 = 946. Oh! That works. Let me check:\n\n272 multiplied by (77 divided by 22) minus 6. Let's compute that step by step. First, 77 divided by 22 is 3.5. Then 272 times 3.5: 272*3 = 816, 272*0.5=136, so 816+136=952. Then subtract 6: 952-6=946. Perfect! So the equation is 272*(77/22) - 6 = 946.\n\nWait, let me make sure all numbers are used once: 272, 77, 22, and 6. Yes, each is used exactly once, and all operations are basic arithmetic. So that's the equation.\n</think>\n\n<answer>272 * (77 / 22) - 6 = 946</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using the numbers 67, 91, 51, and 10 exactly once each, with basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) to reach 894. Hmm, 894 is a pretty big number, so probably multiplication will be involved here. Let me start by thinking about how to combine these numbers to get close to 894.\n\nFirst, let's look at the larger numbers: 91 and 67. If I multiply them, maybe that will get me partway there. 91 times 67... let me calculate that. 90*67 is 6030, so 91*67 would be 6030 + 67 = 6097. That's way too big. But maybe if I subtract something from that product? Wait, 6097 minus something else... but even if I subtract the remaining numbers, which are 51 and 10, that's 6097 - 51 -10 = 6097-61=6036, which is still way over 894. So maybe multiplying those two big numbers isn't the way to go.\n\nAlternatively, maybe combining them with division or addition. Let's try adding 91 and 67: 91+67=158. Then multiply by something. 158*51= 158*50=7900 plus 158*1=158, so 8058. That's way too big. If I subtract 10, that's 8048. Still too big. Not helpful.\n\nWhat if I use division to reduce the numbers? For example, 91 divided by 10 is 9.1. Then 9.1 multiplied by something else. Let's see 9.1 * 51 = 464.1, then adding 67 would be 531.1. Not close. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of 894 as a multiple of some of these numbers. Let's see: 894 divided by 51 is approximately 17.529. Not a whole number. Divided by 67 is about 13.34. Divided by 91 is around 9.82. Divided by 10 is 89.4. Hmm. So maybe 10 times something gives 89.4, but we need to use integers here. Wait, but can we use division to get fractions? The problem doesn't specify that intermediate steps have to be integers, just that each number is used once. So maybe fractions are allowed in the process.\n\nLet me try another approach. Let's see, 51 and 10. If I multiply them, 51*10=510. Then 91+67=158. 510+158=668. Not enough. 510*1.75 would be around 892.5, but how to get that. Maybe 51*10 + 91*67. Wait, 91*67 is 6097, plus 510 is 6607. No, way too high.\n\nWait, maybe subtract instead. Let's think: 91*10=910. Then subtract 51-67? Wait, 910 - (51-67) = 910 - (-16) = 926. Still not 894. Alternatively, 91*10=910. 910 - 67=843. Then adding 51 gives 894. Wait, 910 -67 +51= 894. Let me check:\n\n910 -67 is 843. 843 +51=894. Yes! But does that use all the numbers? Let's see: 91*10 uses 91 and 10. Then subtract 67 and add 51. So the equation would be 91*10 -67 +51. Wait, but that uses all four numbers: 91,10,67,51. So that's (91*10) -67 +51 = 910 -67 +51= 910 -16=894. Yes! Wait, but is that correct?\n\nWait, 91*10 is 910. 910 minus 67 is 843. Then 843 plus 51 is 894. Yes, that works. Let me check if all numbers are used once: 91, 10, 67, 51. Yes, all are used. And the operations are multiplication, subtraction, and addition. So the equation would be 91×10 -67 +51 =894. But according to the problem's example, they use parentheses, but here maybe it's not necessary. Let me write it as (91 * 10) - 67 + 51. But order of operations would handle that correctly. Because multiplication comes first, then left to right. So yes, 91 multiplied by 10, subtract 67, add 51. So that's the equation.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(91 * 10) - 67 + 51 = 894</answer>"}]}

Let me check that again.\n\nSo, 195 divided by 65 is 3. Then 55 minus 8 is 47. Multiply those two results: 3 * 47 equals exactly 141. Yes!

The equation would be (195 / 65) * (55 - 8) = 3 * 47 = 141. Yep, that works. I think that's the solution. Let me just verify each operation step by step. Division first: 195 divided by 65 is indeed 3. Then subtraction: 55 minus 8 is 47. Multiply those two: 3 times 47 is 141. All numbers used once, no repeats.

Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should check if there's a way to combine these numbers with basic operations to get 138. Let me list the numbers again: 9, 46, 36, 12. Let's see what operations can be applied here.\n\n138 is a relatively large number. Let me look at the largest numbers here: 46 and 36. 46 is close to 45, which is 9*5, but maybe that's not helpful. 36 is a multiple of 12 (36/12=3). Let's see if combining 46 and 36 first would help. 46 + 36 is 82, which is still far from 138. 46*36 is 1656, way too big. Maybe 46*3 would be 138. Oh, wait! 46*3 is exactly 138. So if I can get a 3 from the remaining numbers (9, 12), that would work. Let's see: the remaining numbers are 9, 12. How can I get 3 from them? 12 - 9 is 3. Perfect!\n\nSo the equation could be 46 * (12 - 9) + 36. Wait, but wait—no, I need to use all four numbers. Let me check: 46, 12, 9, 36. If I do 46*(12-9) = 46*3 = 138, but then where does 36 fit in? Oh, right, I have to use all numbers. So maybe I need to adjust this.\n\nWait, perhaps 46*3 + 36. But then 3 comes from 12-9, but then 36 is added. Let's calculate: 46*(12-9) + 36. That would be 138 +36=174, which is too much. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 36 divided by something? If I take 36 divided by (12 -9) = 36/3=12. Then 46*12=552. Then subtract 9? 552-9=543. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe 46*3 + 36 -12. Wait, but that would require using 12 again. Wait, but each number must be used once. Let me try to track which numbers I'm using.\n\nIf I do 46*(12-9) =138, that uses 46,12,9. Then I have 36 left. But how to incorporate 36 into the equation to still get 138. Maybe 46*(12-9) + (36 -36) but that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe subtract 36 and add it back somehow. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 46 + 36=82. Then 82 + something. What's left is 9 and 12. 9*12=108. 82+108=190. Not 138.\n\nAlternatively, 36*12=432. Then 432 divided by something. 432 /9=48. 48+46=94. No. 432-46=386. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 46 + 36=82, then 12*9=108. 108 +82=190. Not 138.\n\nHmm. Maybe subtraction. Let's see: 46*3 is 138, but how to use 36 and 12? Wait, if I do 46*(12 - (36/9)). Let's check that. 36 divided by 9 is 4. Then 12 -4=8. 46*8=368. Not 138.\n\nWait, maybe 46*( (36/12) +9). Let's compute that. 36/12=3. 3+9=12. 46*12=552. Not 138.\n\nWait another angle: 138 divided by 46 is 3. So if I can make 3 using 9, 36,12. Let's see. 36 divided by 12=3. Then 9-3=6. Not helpful. Or 12 - (36/9) =12-4=8. Not 3. Wait, 9/(36/12) =9/3=3. Oh! That's 9 divided by (36/12). Because 36 divided by 12 is 3, then 9 divided by 3 is 3. So the equation would be 46 * (9 / (36/12)). Let's check: 36/12=3, then 9/3=3, then 46*3=138. That uses all numbers: 46,9,36,12. Each used once. Let me verify:\n\n46 * (9 / (36 /12)) =46 * (9 /3) =46*3=138. Yes! So this works. The equation is 46 * (9 / (36 /12)). Let me check the order of operations. First, divide 36 by 12, get 3. Then divide 9 by that 3, get 3. Multiply by 46 to get 138. All numbers used once. Perfect.

Each number has to be used exactly once, and the result should be 58. The operations allowed are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Hmm.\n\nFirst, maybe I should think about the target number, 58. It's not a very large number compared to some of the numbers given. For example, 85 is quite big. Maybe I can subtract something from 85 to get closer to 58. Let's try that. 85 minus 28 is 57. That's pretty close. Then maybe use the other numbers to adjust by 1. But wait, we have to use all numbers. So if I do 85 - 28, that uses two numbers. Then I have 8 and 81 left. How can I combine 8 and 81 to get 1? 81 divided by 8 is like 10.125, which is too much. Maybe subtract? 81 - 8 is 73. That's not helpful. Alternatively, 8 - 81 is negative 73. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe multiply or divide. Let's see. 81 divided by 8 is 10.125. If I take 85 - 28 = 57, then 57 + (81/8) would be 57 + 10.125 = 67.125, which is over. Not helpful. Alternatively, 57 - (81/8) would be 57 - 10.125 = 46.875. Not 58. So maybe that approach isn't working.\n\nAnother idea: maybe use 81 and 8 first. Let's see. 81 minus 8 is 73. Then 85 minus 28 is 57. Then 73 - 57 is 16. Not helpful. Alternatively, 81 divided by 8 is about 10.125. If I subtract that from 85: 85 - 10.125 = 74.875. Then subtract 28? 74.875 -28 is 46.875. Not 58. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I need to combine operations differently. Let's try combining 8 and 28 first. 28 divided by 8 is 3.5. Then 85 minus 3.5 is 81.5. Then subtract 81? That gives 0.5. Not 58. Alternatively, 28 times 8 is 224. Then maybe 224 divided by something. Let's see. If I take 224 - 85 = 139. Then 139 minus 81 is 58. Wait, that's 224 -85 -81 = 58. But wait, 28*8=224. Then 224 -85=139. 139-81=58. But that uses 28,8,85,81. So that's all four numbers. Let me check: 28*8=224. 224 -85=139. 139-81=58. So equation would be (28*8) -85 -81 =58. But does that use all numbers? Yes: 28,8,85,81. So that's a possible solution. Wait, but let me verify the calculation. 28 times 8 is indeed 224. 224 minus 85 is 139. 139 minus 81 is 58. Yes! That works. So the equation is (28 × 8) - 85 - 81 = 58. Or written as (28*8) -85 -81 =58. Let me check if all numbers are used once: 28,8,85,81. Yes, all four. So that's the answer. \n\nBut wait, maybe there's another way. Let me see if there's another combination. For example, maybe using division or addition. Suppose we take 85 and divide by something. 85 divided by 5 is 17, but I don't have a 5. Alternatively, 81 divided by 28 is about 2.89. If I subtract that from 85, 85 - (81/28) is roughly 85 - 2.89 = 82.11. Then subtract 8? 82.11 -8=74.11. Not 58. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 85 - (28 + 8) =85-36=49. Then 49 +81=130. No. Not close. \n\nAnother approach: 81 - 28 =53. Then 53 + (85/8). 85/8=10.625. 53+10.625=63.625. Not 58. \n\nAlternatively, 85 - (81 -28)/8. Let's compute that. 81-28=53. 53/8=6.625. 85-6.625=78.375. Not helpful.\n\nWait, but the previous idea with (28*8)-85-81=58 works. Let me confirm again. 28*8 is 224. 224 -85=139. 139-81=58. Yes. So that's correct. So the equation is (28 × 8) - 85 - 81 =58. So that uses all numbers once with multiplication, subtraction. \n\nI think that's a valid solution.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(28 * 8) - 85 - 81 = 58</answer>"}]}

Alternatively, 84 multiplied by 56 is a big number, 4704, which is way more than 252. Maybe that's too big. But maybe if I use division or subtraction somewhere else.\n\nWait, 84 times 3 is 252.

So how can I incorporate the two 56s into the equation without changing the product of 84 and 3?\n\nSince I have to use both 56s, maybe I can use them in a way that cancels out.

Yes, that uses all numbers once each. So the equation would be (56 / 56) * 84 * 3 = 252. Let me verify:\n\n56 divided by 56 is 1. Then 1 multiplied by 84 is 84, then multiplied by 3 gives 252. Yep, that works. All numbers used once. Perfect.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(56 / 56) * 84 * 3 = 252</answer>"}]}

Hmm, let's see. \n\nFirst, let me recall the target is 807. Let me check what numbers I have. The largest number here is 749. So maybe I can start by seeing how 749 can be adjusted to get close to 807. The difference between 807 and 749 is 58. So if I can somehow get 58 from the remaining numbers (69, 1, 11), then adding that to 749 would work. Let's see if that's possible.\n\nThe remaining numbers are 69, 11, and 1. How can I get 58 from them? Let's try different operations. If I subtract 11 from 69, that gives 58. Then, what about the 1? Since we have to use all numbers, maybe we can include the 1 in a way that doesn't change the value. For example, multiply it by something or add it and subtract it. Wait, but if I do 69 - 11 = 58, then adding 1 would give 59. That's not helpful. But maybe we can use division. Let's think.\n\nAlternatively, 69 minus (11 - 1) would be 69 - 10 = 59. Still not 58. Hmm. What if we do 69 - (11 + 1) = 69 -12 = 57. That's even further. Or 11* something. 11*5=55, 11*6=66. 69-66=3. Not helpful. Wait, maybe if I use multiplication elsewhere. Let's see.\n\nWait, maybe I can use 749 plus (69 - (11 -1)). Let's calculate that. 11-1 is 10, so 69 -10 is 59, then 749 +59=808. That's just 1 more than 807. Close, but not quite. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe 749 + (69 -11) +1. Wait, but that would be 749 +58 +1= 808 again. Still 808. Not 807. So that's a problem. How can I adjust that to get one less?\n\nWait, perhaps instead of adding 1, I subtract it. So 749 + (69 -11) -1. That would be 749 +58 -1= 806. That's 806. Still off by 1. Hmm. Not quite. Maybe another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps multiply some numbers. Let's see. If I take 11*69, that's 759. Then subtract 749? Wait, 759 -749=10. Then add 1? That's 11. Not helpful. Alternatively, 749 - (11*69) would be a negative number. Not useful.\n\nWait, maybe (749 - 69) = 680. Then using 11 and 1. 680 + 11* something. 680 +11*12= 680+132=812. Not quite. Alternatively, 680 + 11 +1= 692. No. Or 680 + (11 -1)= 680 +10=690. Still not 807.\n\nAlternatively, 749 / something. 749 divided by 1 is 749. Then adding 69 +11= 829. No, that's higher than 807. 749 divided by 11 is approximately 68.09. If I add 69 and 1, that's 70. 68.09 +70 ≈ 138.09. Not close.\n\nWait, maybe subtract instead. Let's see 749 - (69 +11 +1) =749 -81=668. No, not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 749 +69=818. Then subtract 11*1=11. 818-11=807. Oh! Wait, that works. Let me check: 749 +69 = 818. Then subtract (11*1)=11. So 818-11=807. And all numbers are used once: 749, 69, 11, 1. Yes, that's 807. So the equation would be 749 +69 -11*1. But wait, the order of operations here. If we do 749 +69 - (11*1), that's correct. Alternatively, written as (749 +69) - (11 *1) = 818 -11 =807. That works.\n\nSo the equation is (749 + 69) - (11 * 1) = 807. Alternatively, 749 + 69 - 11 * 1. Since multiplication comes before addition and subtraction, the parentheses aren't strictly necessary, but to make it clear, maybe adding them. So the equation would be 749 + 69 - 11 * 1. Let me verify:\n\n749 +69 = 818\n\n11 *1 =11\n\n818 -11 = 807. Correct.\n\nYes, that's correct. All numbers are used once, and the operations are valid. So that's the equation.\n</think>\n\n<answer>749 + 69 - 11 * 1 = 807</answer>"}]}

Maybe I can break it down into factors or see what combinations might lead there.\n\nFirst, 60 is a multiple of 10 and 6, so maybe I can create 10 or 6 somehow. Let's see.

Hmm, but where would 34 come from?\n\nAlternatively, maybe using division or multiplication. Let's try combinations. Let's list the numbers: 75, 94, 96, 17. Let's see. 96 is the largest. If I subtract something from 96, maybe. 96 - 36 = 60. How to get 36 from the other numbers. 75, 94, 17. Hmm. 75 - 39 = 36? Not sure. Alternatively, 17 + 19 = 36. Wait, 94 - 75 = 19. Oh, maybe 94 - 75 is 19. Then 19 +17 =36. So 96 - (94 -75 +17) = 96 - (36) = 60. Let me check that:\n\n94 -75 = 19. 19 +17=36. Then 96 -36=60. Yes! So that uses all numbers: 96,94,75,17. Each used once. Let me write that as an equation: 96 - (94 -75 +17) = 60. Wait, but according to order of operations, the parentheses would be calculated first. Let's compute:\n\nInside the parentheses: 94 -75 is 19, then 19 +17 is 36. Then 96 -36 is 60. Exactly. So the equation would be 96 - (94 -75 +17) =60. Let me check if all numbers are used once: 96,94,75,17. Yes, each is used once. That works. So the equation is 96 - (94 -75 +17) =60. Let me write that properly with the numbers in order. Alternatively, maybe another arrangement. But as long as all numbers are used once, it's okay. Let me verify again:\n\n94 -75 =19. 19 +17=36. 96 -36=60. Yep. So the equation is 96 - (94 - 75 + 17) =60. So in the required format, using each number once. That should do it.\n</think>\n\n<answer>96 - (94 - 75 + 17) = 60</answer>"}]}

Hmm.\n\nLet me think about division possibilities since 14 is a smaller number. For example, if I can divide two larger numbers to get close to 14. Let's see:\n\n420 divided by 30 is 14, but I don't have a 30. Wait, maybe 420 divided by (something else). Let's check 420 / 30 = 14. But how to get 30 from the remaining numbers? The numbers left would be 300, 72, 62. So maybe 300 - 270 = 30, but 270 isn't directly available. Alternatively, 72 and 62: 72 - 62 = 10. Then 300 / 10 = 30. So combining these steps: 420 / (300 / (72 - 62)) = 420 / (300/10) = 420 /30=14. Wait, that uses all the numbers! Let me check:\n\n72 - 62 = 10. Then 300 divided by that 10 gives 30. Then 420 divided by 30 is indeed 14. So the equation would be 420 / (300 / (72 - 62)) = 14. Let me verify:\n\n72 - 62 = 10. 300 /10 =30. 420 /30 =14. Yes! That uses all four numbers once each. So the equation is 420/(300/(72-62)) =14. Let me write it properly with parentheses. \n\nAnother way to check: Maybe there are other combinations. Let's see. For example, 300 - 420 = -120. Not helpful. 72 and 62: 72+62=134. 420 -134=286. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, 420 -300=120. 120 divided by something? 120/ (72-62)=12. But 12 isn't 14. Close, but not quite. Or 72*62=4464, which is way too big. Maybe 420/72=5.833..., then 5.833... * something. Not sure. Alternatively, 62 - (420 / something). Not sure. \n\nBut the first idea seems to work. Let me confirm again. 72-62=10. 300 divided by 10 is 30. 420 divided by 30 is 14. So all numbers are used once: 300,72,62,420. Operations used: subtraction, division, division. Yes.

Each number can be used only once, and I can use basic operations. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I notice there are two 89s. Maybe I can combine them somehow. Let's think about possible operations. If I subtract them, 89 - 89 is 0, which might not help. Adding them would be 89 + 89 = 178. That's more than 164. Maybe multiplying? 89*89 is way too big. So maybe subtraction isn't the way to go with the two 89s.\n\nWait, the target is 164. Let's look at the other numbers: 88 and 76. 88 is close to 89. Maybe subtract 88 from something. Let's see. If I take 89 + 89 = 178, then subtract 88? 178 - 88 = 90. Not 164. Hmm. Or maybe 88 plus 76. 88+76=164. Oh! Wait, 88+76 is exactly 164. But then I have two 89s left. How do I use them? Because I need to use all numbers. So if I can somehow combine the two 89s into something that equals zero, then add that to 88+76. For example, 89 - 89 = 0. Then 88 + 76 + (89 - 89) = 164. But does that count? Because each number is used once. Let me check: 89, 88, 76, 89. So yes, all numbers are used once. So the equation would be (88 + 76) + (89 - 89) = 164. But maybe parentheses are needed for clarity. Alternatively, the two 89s could be subtracted first. So the equation would be 88 + 76 + 89 - 89 = 164. That works because adding and subtracting the same number cancels out. Let me check: 88+76 is 164, and 89-89 is 0. So 164 +0=164. Perfect! So the equation is 88 + 76 + 89 - 89 = 164. But wait, is that allowed? Each number is used once. The two 89s are each used once in subtraction. So yes, that should work. Let me verify:\n\n88 + 76 = 164. Then +89 -89 is 0. So total is 164. Yes. So the equation is 88 + 76 + 89 - 89 = 164. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way. Let me think. Maybe using multiplication or division. For example, if I take 89 * (something) to get a part of 164. But 89 is a prime number, so 164 divided by 89 is not an integer. Hmm. Or maybe 88 * something. Let's see. 88 * 2 is 176. 176 -12 is 164. But where would the 12 come from? 89 -76 - (other numbers). Not sure. Alternatively, 76 * 2 is 152. 152 + 12 = 164. 12 could be from 88 - 76 =12, but then I would need to use 89. Wait, 76 + (88) + (89 -89) is another way. But that's the same as before.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 89 + 76 = 165. Then 165 -1 =164. How to get 1? 89 -88=1. So putting that together: (89 +76) - (89 -88) = 165 -1 =164. Let's check: 89 +76=165, then subtract (89 -88)=1. So 165-1=164. That uses all numbers: 89,76,89,88. Each used once. So that would be (89 +76) - (89 -88) =164. Let's compute:\n\nFirst part: 89+76=165\n\nSecond part: 89-88=1\n\n165-1=164. Yes, that works. \n\nSo this is another equation. Which one is better? The first one was 88+76 +89-89=164, which is straightforward but maybe the second equation is more efficient. The problem allows any equation as long as all numbers are used once. So both are correct, but maybe the second one is more concise. Let me check the second equation again: (89 +76) - (89 -88) =164. Breaking down the numbers: 89,76,89,88. All four numbers are used once. Yes. So that's a valid solution. \n\nSo there are two possible equations. But the problem says to return one. The user probably wants either. Let me verify once more:\n\nFirst approach: 88 +76 +89 -89 = 164. Simplifies to 88+76 +0=164. Correct.\n\nSecond approach: (89 +76) - (89 -88) =164. Let's compute:\n\n89 +76=165\n\n89 -88=1\n\n165-1=164. Correct.\n\nBoth are valid. The second one might be more interesting because it uses parentheses and different operations. But either is acceptable. However, the problem might prefer using multiplication or division, but in this case, it's not necessary. Since both are valid, perhaps either is acceptable. But maybe the user expects the more \"non-trivial\" one. The second one involves more operations besides addition and subtraction. Let me check if there's another way using multiplication or division, but given the numbers, it's tricky. For example, 89 divided by something. 89 divided by 1 is 89. But 1 is 89-88. Wait, that's similar to the second approach. Hmm. Maybe 89/(89-88) +76=164. Let's test that:\n\n89-88=1. Then 89/1=89. Then 89 +76=165. Not 164. Close. Not helpful. Alternatively, 89/(89-88) +76 - something. Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, 88 * (something) =164. 164 divided by 88 is approximately 1.86, which isn't a clean division. So perhaps not. \n\nSo the two possible equations are the ones I found. Either is acceptable. Since the problem says to return one example, either is fine. Let me choose the second one because it uses parentheses and might be considered more \"creative\".\n</think>\n\n<answer>(89 + 76) - (89 - 88) = 164</answer>"}]}

First, I should check the basic operations and see how these numbers can combine. \n\nLet me start by looking at the largest number, 696. Since 570 is less than 696, maybe I need to subtract something from 696. Let's calculate the difference between 696 and 570. 696 minus 570 is 126. So if I can make 126 using the remaining numbers 75, 55, and 4, then subtracting that from 696 would work. Let's see if 75, 55, and 4 can form 126.\n\nWait, 75 plus 55 is 130. 130 minus 4 is 126. Oh, that's exactly what I need! So 75 + 55 = 130, then 130 - 4 = 126. Then subtract that from 696: 696 - (75 + 55 - 4) = 696 - 126 = 570. Wait, but does that use all the numbers? Let me check: 696, 75, 55, 4. Yes, all are used once. So the equation would be 696 - (75 + 55 - 4) = 570. Let me verify the calculation again: 75 +55 is 130, minus 4 is 126. 696 minus 126 is indeed 570. So that works. \n\nBut wait, the problem requires using each number exactly once, and all of them. Let's make sure. The equation uses 696, subtracts 75 and 55, then adds 4? Wait, no. The expression inside the parentheses is 75 + 55 -4. So 75 and 55 are added, and then 4 is subtracted. So when subtracted from 696, it's 696 - (75 +55 -4) = 696 -75 -55 +4. Wait, that's another way to write it. So 696 -75 is 621, then 621 -55 is 566, then 566 +4 is 570. Yes, that adds up. So all numbers are used once. So the equation would be 696 - 75 -55 +4 = 570. But I need to use all the numbers once, so grouping them with parentheses might be necessary. Let me check if the original expression with parentheses is acceptable: 696 - (75 + 55 -4) = 570. That should be okay. Alternatively, maybe 696 -75 -55 +4. Both are valid. But the problem allows using operations multiple times. So either form is acceptable, as long as each number is used once. So either way, this works.

Let's check the biggest numbers first. 86 and 62 are the two largest. If I multiply them, 86*62 is 5332, which is way too big. Maybe subtract? 86-62=24. Not helpful. What if I add them? 86+62=148. Still not close to 308. \n\nWhat if I use 86 with another number? Let's see. 86 * 40 would be 3440. That's way over. 86 divided by something? Maybe 86/7 is about 12.285... Not sure. \n\nWait, 308 divided by 7 is 44. So if I can make 44 using the other numbers (40, 86, 62) and then multiply by 7. But the problem is I have to use all numbers. So if I do 44*7=308, but then I have to use 40, 86, 62. Hmm. Let's see. Let's try to make 44 from 40, 86, 62. 86 - 62 is 24. 24 + 40 is 64. Not 44. 86 - (62 -40) = 86 -22=64. Still not.

Not 308. \n\nWait, maybe instead of multiplying 7, we can subtract or add. Let's think differently. Let's see, 308 is 40*7.7. But 7.7 isn't an integer, and we can't use decimals. Alternatively, 40*7=280. Then 280 + 28=308. Where can 28 come from? 86 and 62. 86-62=24. Not 28. 62- (86- something). Maybe 86 - 62=24. 24+40=64. 64* something. Hmm. \n\nWait, 62 - (86/40)? Let's see, 86/40 is 2.15, so 62-2.15≈59.85. Multiply by 7 gives 419, not 308. Not helpful. \n\nWhat if we do (40 + 86) = 126. Then 126 * something. 126*2.444 is 308, but again decimals. Maybe 126* (62/ something). Let's try 62/7≈8.857. 126*8.857≈1116. Not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, maybe grouping numbers. Let's see, 86 and 40. 86-40=46. Then 46* something. 46*6=276, 46*7=322. Hmm. 308-276=32. So if 46*6 +32=308. But where would 6 come from? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, 62*5=310, which is close to 308. 62*5 -2=308. But how to get 5 and 2 from the remaining numbers. 86-40=46. 46 divided by 7 is about 6.57. Not 5. \n\nWait, let's think of combining operations. Maybe (86 - 62) * something. 86-62=24. 24*12.833=308. But that's 24* (308/24) ≈12.833. Not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, 40 * 7 = 280. Then 308 - 280 =28. So need 28 from 86 and 62. 86-62=24. 24+4=28. Where does 4 come from? 62-58=4. But not sure. Wait, maybe 62 - (86 - something). Let's see, 86 - x =58, then x=28. But we need to make 28 with other numbers. Not sure. \n\nWait another approach: Let's see 7 is a prime number, so maybe we need to use it as a multiplier or divisor. Let's try (something) *7 =308. So 308/7=44. So the other numbers (40,86,62) need to make 44. Let me check if possible. 86 - 40=46. 46 - 2=44. But where do we get the 2? 62 is left. 62 divided by something. 62/31=2. But 31 isn't in the numbers. Alternatively, 86 - (40 + something)=44. 40 + x =86-44=42. So x=2. Again, same problem. \n\nAlternatively, 62 - (86 -40)=62-46=16. Not 44. \n\nWait, maybe 40 + (86 -62)=40+24=64. 64 is 64, but how to get 44? Hmm. Not helpful. \n\nAnother idea: Maybe 86 * 40 = 3440. Then 3440 divided by something equals 308. 3440 /308≈11.168. Can we make 11.168 from 62 and 7? 62/7≈8.857. Not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, 86 + 62 =148. 148 *2=296. 296 +12=308. 12 from 40 and 7? 40-28=12. 28 from 7*4. But 4 is not available. \n\nWait, 40 -7=33. 148 +33=181. Not 308. \n\nHmm. Maybe division. Let's try (86 * 40) / (62 -7). 86*40=3440. 62-7=55. 3440/55=62.545... Not 308. \n\nAnother angle: Let's see if 62*5=310. Close to 308. 310-2=308. So need 5 and 2. 86-40=46. 46/7≈6.57. Not 5. \n\nAlternatively, 7*44=308. Let's try to make 44 with 40,86,62. Let's see, 86 - (62 -40/ something). Let me try 86 - (62 - (40/ something)). Wait, 40/7≈5.714. 62 -5.714≈56.286. 86 -56.286≈29.714. Not 44. \n\nWait, maybe (86 + 62) =148. 148 - (40/7)≈148-5.714≈142.286. Multiply by 7? Not helpful. \n\nWait, maybe 86 * (7 - (62/40)). Let's compute 62/40=1.55. 7-1.55=5.45. 86*5.45≈468.7. Not 308. \n\nAlternatively, 62 * (7 + (86/40)). 86/40=2.15. 7+2.15=9.15. 62*9.15≈567.3. No. \n\nHmm. Maybe subtraction. Let's think of 86*40=3440. Then 3440 - (62*7)=3440-434=3006. Not close. \n\nAlternatively, 86*62=5332. 5332 - (40*7)=5332-280=5052. Not helpful. \n\nWait, perhaps 40*(7 + something). 40*(7 + x)=308. 7 +x=7.7. So x=0.7. But need to get 0.7 from 86 and 62. Not possible. \n\nAnother approach: Let's use all numbers in a chain. For example: 86 - 40 + 62 *7. Compute that: 86-40=46; 46+62=108; 108*7=756. No. \n\nOr (86 + 62) * (7 - 40). 148*(-33)= -4884. No. \n\nWait, maybe 86 * (62 -40 -7). Let's see: 62-40=22; 22-7=15. 86*15=1290. Not 308. \n\nHmm. Maybe (62 + 40) * something. 102*3=306. Close. 102*3.02≈308. Not helpful. \n\nWait, 62*40=2480. 2480/8=310. 310-2=308. 8 and 2 from 86 and7. 86/7≈12.285. 12.285- something. Not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, 86 - (7* something)=? Let's see 7*44=308. But we have to use all numbers. \n\nWait, maybe ((86 - 62) * 40) /7. Let's compute: 86-62=24. 24*40=960. 960/7≈137.14. Not 308. \n\nWait another idea: 86 + 62 =148. 148*2=296. 296+12=308. 12 can be 40 - 28, but 28 is 7*4. But 4 is not a number here. Alternatively, 40 - (7*4)=12, but again 4 isn't available. \n\nWait, maybe 40*(7) + (86 -62). Let's compute: 40*7=280. 86-62=24. 280+24=304. Close to 308 but 4 short. \n\nHmm. What if 40*7 +86 -62 =280+24=304. Still not. \n\nAlternatively, 86*7=602. 602 - (62*40)=602-2480= -1878. No. \n\nWait, let's try to think outside the box. Maybe combining two numbers into a two-digit number. But the problem states to use the numbers as they are, so 40, 86, 62,7. I think each must be used as separate numbers. \n\nWait, here's an idea. Maybe 86 * (40 - 62/7). Let's compute 62/7≈8.857. 40-8.857≈31.143. 86*31.143≈2678. Not 308. \n\nWait, maybe (40 + 62) * (86 /7). 102*(12.285)≈1253.14. No. \n\nAnother thought: 7* (something) =308. So if we can create 44 from 40,86,62, then 44*7=308. But how to get 44? Let's see. 86 - 40=46. 46 -2=44. So 86-40 - (62/31)=44. But 31 isn't available. Alternatively, 62/(something). Wait, 62/ (86-40)=62/46≈1.347. Not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, (86 + 62) - (40 + 7)=148-47=101. No. \n\nWait, let's try (86 - 7) * (62 -40). 79*22=1738. No. \n\nHmm. Maybe 62*40=2480. Then 2480 / (86-7)=2480/79≈31.39. Not helpful. \n\nWait, here's another approach. Let's list all possible pairs and see:\n\nPossible multiplications:\n\n40*7=280. Then need 308-280=28 from 86 and 62. 86-62=24. 24+4=28. But 4 isn't available. Alternatively, 62- (something). 62-34=28. But 34 isn't here. Hmm. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 86*7=602. 602- (something)=308. 602-308=294. Need to make 294 from 40 and 62. 40+62=102. 102*2.882=294. Not possible. \n\nAlternatively, 62*7=434. 434- (something)=308. 434-308=126. Need 126 from 86 and 40. 86+40=126. So 62*7 - (86 +40)=434-126=308. Wait, that works!\n\nWait, let me check: 62 multiplied by 7 is 434. Then subtract (86 plus 40) which is 126. 434 -126=308. Yes! And we used all numbers: 62,7,86,40. Each exactly once. So the equation is 62*7 -86 -40=308. Or more precisely, (62 * 7) - (86 + 40) = 308.\n\nBut let me compute again:\n\n62*7=434\n\n86+40=126\n\n434-126=308. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the equation is (62 × 7) - (86 + 40) = 308. \n\nAlternatively, written as 62*7 -86 -40 =308.\n\nBut need to use all numbers once. Let's verify: 62,7,86,40 are all used. Yes. And operations are multiplication, subtraction, and addition (since 86+40 is part of it). So this should be correct.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(62 * 7) - 86 - 40 = 308</answer>"}]}

All numbers have to be used once with basic operations. Hmm, let's start by thinking about what combinations might get close to 447.\n\nFirst, 55 is a big number. Maybe multiplying it by something. If I take 55 times 8, that's 440, which is close to 447. But 8 isn't one of the numbers. Wait, but maybe I can make 8 using the other numbers. Let's see: the remaining numbers are 19, 43, and 7. How can I get 8 from those? 43 minus 19 is 24, which is too big. 19 minus 7 is 12. Not helpful. Maybe 43 divided by something? 43 divided by 7 is about 6.14, not 8. Hmm, maybe that approach isn't working.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 55 multiplied by 19? Let's check: 55*19 is 1045, way too big. That's over. What about 55*8.1... Wait, but we need to use all numbers. Let's think of other combinations.\n\nHow about 43 times 10 is 430. 430 plus 17 is 447. But do I have 10 and 17? Let's see. The numbers left would be 55, 19, 7. To get 10 and 17. Maybe 55 minus 19 is 36, but that's not helpful. Wait, maybe 43*10 + (55 - 19 -7). Wait, that's 430 + 29 = 459, which is over. Not helpful.\n\nAnother approach: Let's see the target is 447. Let's subtract 55 from 447, that's 392. Then we need to make 392 with 19, 43, 7. 43*9 is 387, close. How to get 9 from 19 and 7? 19-7 is 12, 19/7 is about 2.7. Hmm, not helpful. Or maybe 43* something plus something else. 43*8 = 344. 344 + 48 = 392. But where would 48 come from? 19*2.5, but we don't have fractions here.\n\nWait, maybe another approach. Let's think of 447 as 450 - 3. 450 is 55*8.18... Hmm. Maybe 55*8 + something. Wait, if we can make 8 from 19,43,7, then 55*8 + the remaining? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, 55 + 43 is 98. 98*4.5 is 441, which is close. But where do 4.5 and the rest come from? Let's see. The remaining numbers are 19 and 7. 19 -7 is 12. 12* something? Not sure. Alternatively, 19*7=133. 133 + 55 +43 is 231, not enough. Maybe 55*7=385. 385 + 43 = 428. Then 428 +19=447. Wait, that's 55*7 +43 +19. Let me check: 55*7 is 385, plus 43 is 428, plus 19 is 447. Oh, that works! Wait, let me verify:\n\n55*7 = 385\n\n385 +43 = 428\n\n428 +19 = 447\n\nYes! So that uses all the numbers: 55,7,43,19. Each used once. Operations are multiplication, addition, addition. So the equation would be 55*7 +43 +19 = 447. Let me write that properly with parentheses as needed. Since multiplication comes first, it would be (55 * 7) + 43 + 19. But parentheses might not be necessary, but to make the order clear, maybe. Alternatively, just 55*7 +43 +19.

I need to create an equation using the numbers 891, 31, 16, and 44 exactly once each, with basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) to reach 982. Hmm, 982 is a pretty large number. Let's start by thinking about how these numbers can combine.\n\nFirst, the largest number here is 891. If I can add something to 891 to get close to 982, that might work. Let's calculate the difference: 982 - 891 = 91. So I need to make 91 using the remaining numbers: 31, 16, and 44. Wait, but 31 + 16 + 44 is 91! Let me check: 31 + 16 is 47, plus 44 is 91. Oh, that's perfect! So adding 891 + (31 + 16 + 44) would give 891 + 91 = 982. But wait, the problem says I can use each number only once and must use all of them. So in this case, the equation would be 891 + 31 + 16 + 44. But does that use each number once? Yes. But wait, that's just adding all of them. Let me check the sum: 891 + 31 is 922, plus 16 is 938, plus 44 is 982. Oh, that's correct! So maybe the answer is simply adding all the numbers together. But wait, the problem says \"create an equation that equals 982\" and allows using operations one or multiple times. But in this case, the sum of all four numbers is exactly 982. Let me confirm: 891 + 31 is 922, plus 16 is 938, plus 44 is 982. Yep, that's right. So the equation is 891 + 31 + 16 + 44 = 982. But do I need to use any operations other than addition? The problem allows using them, but it's not necessary. Since all numbers are used once with addition, that's a valid solution. Hmm, maybe I overcomplicated it, but that seems straightforward. Let me just check if there's another way in case I made a mistake. For example, maybe using multiplication or division. Let's see: 44 is a number that could be multiplied. If I do 44 * something. Let's see: 44*22 is 968, but I don't have 22. Alternatively, 891 is a big number. Maybe subtract something. 891 - something. But 891 - 31 is 860, then adding 16 + 44 (which is 60) gives 860 +60=920, which is too low. Alternatively, multiply 31 and 16: 31*16=496. Then 496 + 891=1387, which is way over. Then subtract 44: 1387-44=1343. No good. How about division? 44 divided by 16 is 2.75, which might not help. 891 divided by 31 is approximately 28.74. Maybe 28.74 * something. But 28.74 * 44 is 1264.56, which is over. Not helpful. Alternatively, 16 divided by 44 is 0.36... Not useful. Another approach: Maybe 891 + (44 - 16) * 31. Let's calculate 44-16=28. Then 28*31=868. 891 +868=1759. Way too big. Hmm. What if I do 891 + (31*16) - 44? 31*16=496. 891+496=1387-44=1343. Still too high. Maybe subtract: 891 - (something). Let's see, 891 - 31=860. Then 44*16=704. 860+704=1564. No. Alternatively, 44* (31 -16). 31-16=15. 44*15=660. 660+891=1551. Still no. Alternatively, 44*16=704. 891-704=187. Then 187 +31=218. No. How about 891 +44=935. Then 31*16=496. 935 -496=439. Nope. Hmm, maybe division. Let's think. 891 divided by 31. 891 ÷31 is approximately 28.7419. Then 28.7419 * (44 -16) =28.7419 *28≈804. Then that's not enough. Alternatively, 44 /16=2.75. Then 31*2.75=85.25. 891+85.25=976.25. Close to 982 but not enough. Then maybe add the remaining numbers? Wait, but I already used 44 and 16. Oh right, we have to use each number exactly once. So perhaps that approach isn't possible. Maybe 891 + (44 + (31 * 16))? Let's see: 31*16=496. 496+44=540. 891+540=1431. No. Alternatively, 891 - (44 / (31 -16)). Let's see: 31-16=15. 44/15≈2.933. 891 -2.933≈888.067. Then add the remaining number? Wait, but 44 and 16 and 31 are used here. Wait, no. If I do 891 - (44/(31-16)), that uses 891,44,31,16. All numbers. Then 44/(31-16)=44/15≈2.933. 891 -2.933≈888.067. Which is not 982. So that's not helpful. Another idea: 891 + (31*(44 -16)). Let's compute 44-16=28. 31*28=868. 891+868=1759. No. Hmm. Alternatively, 44*(31 - (891/16)). Wait, 891 divided by 16 is 55.6875. Then 31 -55.6875= -24.6875. Multiply by 44: -1086.25. Not helpful. Maybe subtract in another way: 891 -31=860. Then 44*16=704. 860 +704=1564. Not helpful. Maybe 44*(16+31). 16+31=47. 44*47=2068. Then 2068 -891=1177. Not 982. Hmm. Alternatively, (891 -31) + (44*16). 891-31=860. 44*16=704. 860+704=1564. No. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The initial idea of just adding all numbers gives exactly 982. Let me check again: 891 +31=922, +16=938, +44=982. Yes. So that's the simplest answer. But the problem allows using operations multiple times, but here it's just addition. So that should be acceptable. So the equation is 891 + 31 + 16 + 44 = 982. Therefore, the answer is (891 + 31) + 16 + 44. Or maybe written as 891 + 31 + 16 + 44. Either way, since addition is associative. So that's the solution.\n</think>\n\n<answer>891 + 31 + 16 + 44 = 982</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using the numbers 894, 40, 4, and 22, each exactly once, with basic operations, and the result should be 880. Hmm. Let's start by thinking about the target number, 880. How can I get there from these numbers?\n\nFirst, let's look at the largest number, 894. If I subtract something from 894 to get 880, that something would be 14. But do I have numbers that can make 14? The available numbers left are 40, 4, and 22. Let's see: 22 - (40 / 4) = 22 - 10 = 12. Not 14. Or maybe 40 - (22 +4) = 14. Oh, wait, 40 - (22 +4) is 14. So then 894 - (40 - 22 -4) would be 894 -14=880. Wait, but I need to use all the numbers exactly once. Let me check that.\n\nIf I do 894 - (40 - (22 + 4)), that would be 40 - 26=14, so 894-14=880. Wait, but that uses 40, 22, and 4. So that's all the numbers. Let me see:\n\n894 - (40 - 22 - 4) = 894 - (14) = 880. Wait, but the way the parentheses are, 40 - (22 +4) is 14. So that's 40 - 26=14. Then subtract that from 894. So the equation would be 894 - (40 - (22 + 4)) = 880. Let me check: 22+4=26, 40-26=14, 894-14=880. Yes, that works. So that uses all the numbers: 894, 40, 22, and 4. Each once. The operations are subtraction and addition, and parentheses. So the equation is 894 - (40 - (22 + 4)) = 880. But wait, does the problem require the equation to be written with all numbers and operations? Let me make sure.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe multiply some numbers. For example, 22 times 40 is 880. But then we have 894 and 4 left. If 22*40=880, how to get from 894 and 4 to zero? Like 894 - 894 + 22*40, but that would require using 894 twice, which isn't allowed. Hmm. Alternatively, 22*40=880, then subtract 894-4=890. Not helpful. Wait, maybe 894 - 4 = 890. Then 890 - (something) to get 880, but that would need 10. But 22 and 40 are used. Hmm. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, 40*22=880, so if I can somehow use 894 and 4 to create 0. Maybe 894 - 4*223.5, but that's not allowed. Not helpful. So maybe the first approach is better. Let me go back.\n\n894 - (40 - (22 +4)) = 894 - (40 -26) = 894 -14=880. That works. All numbers used once. Let me check if there's another way. Maybe 40 divided by something. 40/4=10. Then 894 - (22*10) = 894 -220=674. Not 880. Not helpful. Or 22* (40/4) =22*10=220. 894-220=674 again. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 894 - 22 = 872. Then 40*4=160. 872-160=712. Not 880. No. How about 894 -40=854. Then 22*4=88. 854-88=766. Nope.\n\nWhat if we add 894 and something? 880 is less than 894, so maybe subtraction. Another angle: 40*22=880. So if we can get 40*22 using the numbers, but 894 and 4 would need to be used. But 40*22 is already 880, so how to involve 894 and 4. Maybe 40*22 + (894-4), but that would be 880 + 890=1770. Way over. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 894 / something. 894 divided by something equals 880. But that would require 894/ (something) =880, which would make the denominator very close to 1, which isn't possible with the numbers 40,4,22.\n\nHmm. Let's think again. Maybe 22* (40 -4) =22*36=792. Then 792 + something. 894 is left. But 894 -792=102. But 894 is already used. So that's not possible.\n\nWait, maybe (894 - 40) / (4) = 854/4=213.5. Not 880. Not helpful.\n\nAnother idea: 894 - (22 * (40 /4 )) = 894 - (22*10)=894-220=674. No.\n\nWait, maybe 894 - ( (40 /4 ) -22 ). Let's compute: 40/4=10. Then 10-22= -12. So 894 - (-12)=894 +12=906. Not 880.\n\nAlternatively, 894 + (40 - (22*4)). Let's compute: 22*4=88. 40-88= -48. 894-48=846. Not 880.\n\nHmm. Maybe 22*40 - (894 /4 ). 22*40=880. 894/4=223.5. 880 -223.5=656.5. Not helpful.\n\nWait, the first approach seems the only possible. Let me verify again: 894 - (40 - (22 +4 )). So inside the innermost parentheses: 22 +4=26. Then 40-26=14. Then 894-14=880. That's correct. So the equation is 894 - (40 - 22 -4) = 880. But written properly with parentheses: 894 - (40 - (22 + 4)) = 880. Yes.\n\nAlternatively, could I arrange it differently? Like 894 -40 +22 +4. Wait, that would be 894-40=854, then +22=876, +4=880. Oh! Wait, that's 894 -40 +22 +4. Let's compute that:\n\n894 -40 is 854. 854 +22 is 876. 876 +4 is 880. Yes! So that uses all numbers: 894 -40 +22 +4 =880. But wait, does that use each number once? Yes: 894, 40,22,4. Each used once. The operations are subtraction and addition. So that's a valid equation. That seems simpler. How did I miss that earlier?\n\nSo this equation: 894 -40 +22 +4. Let's compute step by step:\n\n894 -40 = 854.\n\n854 +22 = 876.\n\n876 +4 =880.\n\nYes! That works. All numbers used once, operations are subtraction and additions. So the equation is 894 -40 +22 +4 =880. That's a straightforward equation without nested parentheses. So that's better.\n\nSo why didn't I think of that before? Maybe because I was focusing on combining the other numbers first. But this is much simpler. So the answer is 894 -40 +22 +4 =880. Let me check again: 894-40=854, +22=876, +4=880. Yep.\n\nSo the answer is that equation. So I should present that.\n</think>\n\n<answer>894 - 40 + 22 + 4 = 880</answer>"}]}

Let me start by thinking about possible combinations. Hmm, 239 is a large number, so maybe I can subtract something from it to get close to 130. Let's see, 239 minus what? If I subtract 88, that's 151. Still too big. If I subtract 35, that's 204. Still not close. Maybe subtract 14? 239-14=225. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe adding some numbers and then subtracting others. Let's see, 35 + 88 = 123. Then 239 - 14 = 225. But 123 and 225... Not sure how to combine them. Wait, maybe 123 + something? 123 + 14 = 137. Close but not 130. Alternatively, 225 - 95 would be 130, but where would 95 come from? Maybe 35 + (88-14)=35+74=109. Not helpful.\n\nWait, what if I divide some numbers. Let's see, 239 divided by something. 239/14 is about 17, which might not help. 239 divided by 35 is around 6.8. Not useful. 88 divided by 14 is 6.285. Hmm. Maybe multiplication. 35*3=105, but I don't have a 3. 35*4=140, which is more than 130. So 35* something. Maybe 35*3 + something? But not sure.\n\nWait, let's think about combining 88 and 35. 88 + 35 = 123. Then 130 - 123 = 7. How can I get 7 from the remaining numbers 14 and 239? 239 divided by 14 is roughly 17, which isn't 7. 14 divided by something? 14/2=7, but where do I get 2? Maybe 239 - (88 +35) = 239 -123=116. Then 116 +14=130. Wait, that would be 239 - 123 +14 =130. But 123 is 88+35, so 239 - (88+35) +14=130. Let me check that: 88+35=123, 239-123=116, 116+14=130. Yes! But does that use all numbers once? Let me verify: 14,35,88,239 are all used. So the equation would be 239 - 88 -35 +14 =130. Wait, that's 239 -88=151, 151-35=116, 116+14=130. So yes. So the equation is 239 -88 -35 +14 =130. Let me write that as (239 - 88) -35 +14. Or maybe 239 -88 -35 +14. That works. All numbers used once with operations -, -, +. Let me check the arithmetic again: 239 minus 88 is 151. 151 minus 35 is 116. 116 plus 14 is 130. Correct.

I need to create an equation using the numbers 855, 51, 57, and 93 exactly once each, with basic arithmetic operations, to get 672. Hmm. Let me start by thinking about how these numbers can interact. \n\nFirst, 672 is a bit less than 700. The largest number here is 855, so maybe that can be a starting point. If I subtract something from 855, maybe? Let's see: 855 minus what would give 672? 855 - 672 = 183. So I need to make 183 using the remaining numbers: 51, 57, 93. Wait, but 51 + 57 + 93 is 201, which is too big. Alternatively, maybe 93 multiplied by something. 93 * 2 = 186, which is close to 183. But how to get 2 from 51 and 57? 57 - 51 = 6. 6 divided by something... Hmm. 57 - 51 = 6, then 6 /3=2, but I don't have a 3. Wait, maybe another approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe multiply 51 and 57. 51*57 is a big number, 2907. That's way too big. Dividing that by something? 2907 /93 = let's see: 93*31=2883, 93*31=2883, so 2907-2883=24. So 31 + 24/93, which is not helpful. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps using division to reduce some numbers. Let's think about 855 divided by something. 855 / 51 is approximately 16.76. Not helpful. 855 /57 is 15. 855 divided by 15 is 57. Wait, maybe 855 divided by 15 is 57, but how does that help?\n\nAlternatively, maybe 57 and 93 can be combined. 57 +93=150. Then 855 -150=705. Then subtract 51: 705-51=654. Not 672. Not close enough.\n\nWait, maybe I need to use multiplication. For example, 51 * 57 = 2907. Then 2907 divided by 93 is 2907 ÷93. Let me calculate that. 93*31=2883, so 2907-2883=24. So 31 +24/93≈31.258. Not helpful. Hmm.\n\nWhat about 93 -57=36. Then 51*36=1836. Then 855 +1836=2691. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 855 - (93 +51) =855 -144=711. Then 711 -57=654. Still not 672.\n\nWait, maybe multiplication and subtraction. Let's think: 855 - (something). Let me try different combinations. Let's see, 51 and 57: 51+57=108. Then 93-108= -15. Not helpful. Maybe 57 -51=6. Then 93 *6=558. Then 855 -558=297. Not 672.\n\nAlternatively, 855 divided by 51 is roughly 16.76, then multiply by 57? 16.76*57= about 955. That's over. Then subtract 93? Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe 855 divided by (something). Let's think: 855 divided by 5. Let's see, 855/5=171. But how to get 5 from the other numbers. 51 divided by something? 51/10.2=5, but not helpful. Maybe 57-51=6, and 93 divided by 6=15.5. Then 855 divided by 15.5 is about 55.1. Doesn't help.\n\nHmm. Maybe I need to use more than two operations. Let's try combining numbers in steps. For example, 93 -51=42. Then 57 multiplied by 42=2394. Then 855 +2394=3249. Then divided by something? But that's way over. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe the target is 672. Let's factor 672. 672 divided by 6 is 112. 672 divided by 12 is 56. Hmm. Let's see. 672 is 6*112, or 7*96, 8*84, 12*56, 16*42, 21*32, etc. Maybe I can find factors that can be made with the numbers. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, 855 - 57 =798.

Let me start by thinking about the big numbers first because 950 is close to 940. Maybe if I subtract something from 950. Let's see, 950 - (something) = 940. So the difference here is 10. So I need to make 10 using 6, 72, and 88. Wait, but how? Let's see. Let's see, 72 divided by 6 is 12. Then maybe 12 minus something? But I have 88 left. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe 88 - (72 + 6) = 88 - 78 = 10. That works! So 950 - (88 - 72 - 6) would be 950 - (88 -78) = 950 -10=940. Wait, but that uses all the numbers. Let me check. Wait, 88 -72 -6 is 10, but that uses 88,72,6. Then 950 minus that. So numbers used are 950,88,72,6. Yes, all four. So the equation would be 950 - (88 - 72 -6) = 940. Let me compute that again. 88 -72 is 16, then 16 -6 is 10. 950 -10 is 940. Yes! That works. Let me just check if that's correct. So the numbers are all used once, and the operations are subtraction. So the equation is 950 - (88 -72 -6) =940. Let me write that in the required format.\n\nAnother way to check: Maybe 950 -88 +72 +6. Let's compute that. 950-88 is 862, plus72 is 934, plus6 is 940. Wait, that's another possible equation: 950 -88 +72 +6 =940. That uses all numbers once. Oh, right, that's even simpler. So in this case, the operations are -, +, +. So 950 -88 is 862, +72 is 934, +6 is 940. Yes. So this is another valid equation. So which one is better? Both use all numbers once. The second one is a straight equation without parentheses. So perhaps that's better. Let me confirm. 950 -88 = 862. 862 +72 =934. 934 +6=940. Correct. So the equation would be 950 -88 +72 +6 =940. That uses all numbers once and each operation. So that's a valid answer. Let me see if there are other possibilities. For example, 72* something. 72*13=936, which is close to 940, but I don't have 13. Alternatively, 72* (something) plus or minus others. Let's see, 72*12=864. Then 864 + something. 950 -864=86. So 864 +76=940? But 76 would need to be made from 88 and 6. 88 -6*2=76, but I can't use 6 twice. Alternatively, 88 - (6 + something). Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, 950 -72* something. 72*13 is 936, 950-936=14. Then need to make 14 with 88 and 6. Not sure. 88 divided by 6 is about 14.666, but that's not 14. Hmm. Maybe not useful. So the second approach seems better. So 950 -88 +72 +6 =940. Let me check again. 950-88=862. 862+72=934. 934+6=940. Yes. That's correct. So this uses all numbers once and the operations are -,+,+.\n\nAlternatively, using multiplication or division. Let me think. Maybe 950 divided by something. 950/1=950. But 1 is not in the numbers. Alternatively, 950 divided by (something) multiplied by another. Wait, 950 divided by (88/72) would be 950*(72/88). Let me compute that. 72/88 is 0.818..., 950*0.818 ≈ 777. Not helpful. How about 950 - (72*6) =950 -432=518. Then 518 +88=606. Not helpful. Alternatively, 950 - (88*6)=950-528=422. Then 422 +72=494. No. Not close. Maybe 72/6=12. Then 950 -12=938. Then 938 + (88- something). Wait, 88 - something. But we already used 72,6. So that's 938 + (88 - ?). But 88 is already a number. Wait, maybe 72/6=12. Then 950 -12=938. Then 938 +88=1026. Too much. No. Alternatively, 950 - (72* (something)). Let's see. Maybe 950 - (72 +88)/6. Let's compute 72+88=160. 160/6≈26.666. 950-26.666≈923.333. Not 940. Hmm. Not helpful. Alternatively, (950 -72) * something. 950-72=878. Multiply by 88/6? 878*(88/6)=878*14.666≈12885. Not helpful. So maybe the best approach is the earlier one where we do 950 -88 +72 +6=940. Let me check again. 950-88=862. 862+72=934. 934+6=940.

So if I can get 2 from the other numbers. Let's see: 58 - 56=2. How to get 56 from 18 and something else? 18*3=54, but I don't have a 3. Alternatively, 58- (53- something). Wait, maybe 58 - (53 - (18/13)). Let's compute that: 18/13 is about 1.384. 53 -1.384 is 51.616. Then 58 -51.616 ≈6.384. Not helpful.\n\nHmm. Let's think differently. Maybe (53 - 58) = -5. Then 13 - (-5) =18. Then 18 / something. Wait, not sure.\n\nWait, maybe combining all four numbers with operations. Let's try (58 - 53) =5. Then 18 -13=5. So 5 *5=25. Close to 26, but not quite. Maybe add 1 somewhere? But how?\n\nAlternatively, 53 -13=40. Then 58 -18=40. Then 40 / (something). But that's two 40s. Not useful. Wait, 53 -13=40, and then 58 -40=18. But that uses 53,13,58, and then 18 is left. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe (58 - (53 -13)) * 18. Let's compute: 53-13=40, 58-40=18. Then 18*18=324. No.\n\nAnother angle: Let's try 53 divided by 13 is 4.07. Then 58 - 18=40. 40 divided by (53/13) is 40/(4.07)≈9.83. Still no.\n\nWhat if I do 53 - (58 / (18 -13))? Let's see: 18-13=5. 58/5=11.6. Then 53 -11.6=41.4. Not 26.\n\nWait, maybe 58 - (53 -13) =58-40=18. Then 18 divided by 18=1. Not useful.\n\nAlternatively, (53 +13) =66. Then 66 -58=8. Then 18 -8=10. Not helpful.\n\nHmm. Maybe I need to use division in a way that multiplies up. Let's see: 18 *13=234. Then 58 -53=5. 234 /5=46.8. Not 26.\n\nWait, 58 -53=5. Then 18 divided by (13 -5) =18/8=2.25. Then 2.25 * something? Not helpful.\n\nWait, what if I do (53 - (58 / 13)) +18. Let's compute: 58/13≈4.46. 53-4.46≈48.54 +18≈66.54. No.\n\nAlternatively, 58/(13 - (53/18)). Let's compute 53/18≈2.944. Then 13 -2.944≈10.056. 58/10.056≈5.77. Not 26.\n\nHmm. Maybe subtract two larger numbers. 53 +58=111. Then 18+13=31. 111 -31=80. Not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps 58 -13=45. Then 53 -18=35. 45 -35=10. Not 26.\n\nAnother idea: (53 -13) =40, then 58 - (40 / something) =26. Let's see: 58 - x=26, so x=32. So 40 divided by something equals 32. So 40 /32=1.25. So the denominator would need to be 1.25. How can I get 1.25 from the remaining numbers? 18 and something else. Wait, 18 divided by (something) =1.25. That something would be 18/1.25=14.4. But I don't have 14.4. Alternatively, 13 + (something)=14.4. Hmm, not possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 58 - (18/(53-13)) =26. Let's check: 53-13=40. 18/40=0.45. 58 -0.45=57.55. Not 26.\n\nWait, maybe (53 +13) =66. Then 66 - (58 -18)=66-40=26. Wait, let me check that step by step. 53+13=66. Then 58-18=40. Then 66-40=26. Oh! That works! Let me verify the numbers: 53,13,58,18. All used once. Operations: addition, subtraction, subtraction. So the equation would be (53 +13) - (58 -18) = 66 -40=26. Yes! That adds up correctly. So the equation is (53 +13) - (58 -18) =26. Let me write that properly with the numbers in order, but as long as each number is used once and all operations are allowed, that should work.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(53 + 13) - (58 - 18) = 26</answer>"}]}

Parentheses can change the order, so maybe I need to use them to structure the equation properly. Let me start by listing out all the numbers and think about possible combinations.\n\nThe target is 48. Let's see, 48 is a multiple of 8 (since 8*6=48). I have 8 in the numbers, so maybe using 8 multiplied by something else could be a starting point. But I need to use all four numbers, so if I use 8* something, the other numbers would need to combine to 6. Wait, but 46, 16, 41 are left. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe subtract or add other numbers to reach 48. Let's check some possibilities.\n\nAnother angle: 46 is close to 48. If I can get 46 plus 2, that would be 48. But how can I get 2 from 16, 41, and 8? Let's see: 16 divided by 8 is 2. So 16/8=2. Then 46 + (16/8) = 46 + 2 = 48. Wait, but then I haven't used 41. Oh right, I need to use all four numbers. So that approach doesn't work because 41 is left out.\n\nHmm. So maybe another way. Let's think about the other numbers. 16 and 8 are both multiples of 8. 16 divided by 8 is 2, multiplied by something else. Let's see. If I do 16/8 = 2, then multiply by something. 41 and 46 are left. Maybe 46 - 41 = 5. Then 2*5=10. But that's not 48. Alternatively, 41 - (something). Not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps combining 41 and 46. 46 - 41 = 5. Then 5 multiplied by something. If I have 16 and 8 left, 16 - 8=8. Then 5*8=40. Not 48. Or 16/8=2, 5*2=10. Still not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe adding 46 and 16. 46+16=62. Then subtract something. 62 - 41=21. Then 21 +8=29. No. Not helpful.\n\nWait, 46 - 16 =30. 30 +41=71. 71 -8=63. No. Not 48.\n\nHow about 41 - 8 = 33. Then 33 + 16 =49. 49 -46=3. Not useful.\n\nLet me try using multiplication. Maybe 16 * 3 =48. How to get 3 from the remaining numbers? 46,41,8. Let's see. 46 -41=5. 8 -5=3. So that would be (8 - (46 -41))=3. Then 16 * (8 - (46 -41)) =16*3=48. Wait, let me check that:\n\nFirst, compute 46 -41 =5. Then 8 -5=3. Then 16*3=48. So the equation would be 16*(8 - (46 -41))=48. Let me check if that uses all numbers. Yes: 16,8,46,41. Each used once. And operations are subtraction inside the parentheses, then multiplication. So that works. But let me verify the calculation step by step.\n\n46 -41 =5. 8 -5=3. 16*3=48. Yes. So the equation is 16*(8 - (46 -41)) =48. So the numbers are used once each, and all operations are allowed. So maybe this is the solution. Let me write that as (16 * (8 - (46 - 41))) which equals 48.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way, but this seems to work. Let me double-check. 46-41 is 5, 8-5 is 3, 16*3=48. Correct. So all numbers are used once. So the equation is (16 * (8 - (46 - 41))) =48. That should be the answer.\n</think>\n\n<answer>16 * (8 - (46 - 41))</answer>"}]}

If I can multiply 47 by something to get close to 940, that might work. Let's see: 47 times 20 is 940. Wait, 47*20 is exactly 940! Oh, that's interesting. But wait, I need to use both 11s and the 20. Since 47*20 already gives 940, but then I have two 11s left. How can I incorporate them without changing the result?\n\nMaybe I can subtract and add them in a way that cancels out. For example, 47*20 + 11 - 11. That would be 940 + 0 = 940. Let me check: 47*20 is 940, then adding 11 and subtracting 11 cancels out, so the total is 940. But does that use all the numbers?

So maybe 1 + (41 - 38) = 4, which is not 3. Hmm, not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe multiply or divide some numbers. Let's think. If I take 75 and 74, perhaps divide them. But 75/74 is just a little over 1. Then I need to use 38 and 41. Maybe subtract something. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe pair the numbers differently. Let's consider 38 and 41. 38 + 41 = 79. Then subtract 75? 79 -75 =4. Then subtract 74? 4 -74 is -70, which is way off. Not helpful.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe use division to get a small number. For example, 74 divided by something.

It's a relatively large number, so maybe multiplication or addition of the bigger numbers would help. \n\nFirst, let me look at the numbers provided. The largest numbers here are 97, 81, 66, and 4. Since 97 is the biggest, maybe multiplying it by something would get close to 733. Let's see: 97 multiplied by 7 is 679, which is under 733. 97*8 is 776, which is over. So maybe 97*7.5 would be around 730. But how to get 7.5 using the other numbers? The other numbers are 81, 66, and 4. Wait, but we can only use each number once. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe combine 97 and 81 first. 97 + 81 is 178. Then maybe multiply by 4? 178*4 is 712. That's close to 733. Then add 66? But 712 +66 is 778, which is way over. Hmm.

Let me start by writing down the target number and the given numbers.\n\nFirst, the target is 947. The numbers I have are 794, 100, 75, and 22. Let me think about how these numbers can combine. Since 794 is a large number close to 947, maybe that's a starting point. If I subtract something from 794, can I get to 947? Wait, no, because 794 is less than 947. So maybe adding to 794? But 794 plus something would be way over. 794 + 100 is 894, which is still under. 894 + 75 is 969, which is over. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe start with a larger number by combining some of the others. But 100 is a big number. Let's think differently.\n\nWhat if I do 100 * 75? That's 7500, way too big. Not helpful. Maybe division? 75 divided by 22 is like 3.4... Not sure. 100 divided by 22 is around 4.5. Maybe subtract some combination. Let's see.\n\nWait, 947 is 794 + 153. Do I have a way to get 153 from the remaining numbers: 100, 75, 22? Let's check. 100 + 75 = 175. 175 - 22 = 153. Ah! So 100 + 75 -22 = 153. Then 794 + (100 +75 -22) = 794 +153=947. But let me verify the order. Since all numbers must be used exactly once, here 794 is used, 100,75,22. Yes. So the equation would be 794 + 100 +75 -22. Let me check that: 794+100=894, +75=969, -22=947. Yes! That works. But wait, are all operations allowed? Since we can use the operations multiple times, and each number once. So the equation would be (794 + 100 + 75) -22. Or maybe written as 794 +100+75-22. Since all numbers are used once. Let me check the arithmetic again. 794 +100 is 894, plus 75 is 969, minus 22 is 947. Exactly. So that's the solution. I think that's it. Let me see if there's another way, but this seems straightforward. Wait, does the problem allow using only one operation each time?

I need to create an equation using the numbers 19, 52, 6, and 39, each exactly once, with basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) to get 943. Hmm, 943 is a pretty big number, so maybe multiplication is involved here. Let me think about possible combinations.\n\nFirst, let me list out the numbers: 19, 52, 6, 39. All four must be used. Let's see. The largest numbers here are 52 and 39. If I multiply those together: 52 * 39. Let me calculate that. 50*39 is 1950, plus 2*39 is 78, so 1950+78=2028. That's way bigger than 943. Hmm. Maybe subtract something from that? But then I have 19 and 6 left. So 2028 - (19+6) = 2028-25=2003, which is still too big. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe combine 52 and 6 first. 52*6 is 312. Then 39*19. Let me compute that. 40*19 is 760, minus 1*19 is 19, so 760-19=741. Then 312 + 741 = 1053. Still over. Hmm. Or maybe subtract: 741 - 312 = 429. Not close.\n\nWait, 943 divided by, say, 19 is 943/19. Let me check that. 19*50 is 950, which is 7 more than 943. So 19*49=931, which is 12 less. So 943 is not divisible by 19. Similarly, 52: 52*18=936, 52*18.1=943. So maybe 52*(something) but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, 39 * 24 is 936, which is close to 943. Hmm. But how to get 24 from 19, 52, 6? Maybe 52 - (19 + 6) = 52-25=27. 39*27=1053, which is over. Not helpful.\n\nWait, let's think of division possibilities. Maybe if we can get a larger number by dividing. For example, 52 divided by 6 is roughly 8.666. If we multiply that by something. Let's see: 52/6 ≈8.666. Then 39*8.666≈39*8.666≈338. Then adding 19: 338+19=357. Not close.\n\nWhat if we do 19*52. That's 19*50=950 plus 19*2=38, so 988. Then subtract something. 988 - (39 +6)= 988-45=943. Wait, that works! Let me check. 19*52 is 988. Then subtract (39 +6) which is 45. 988-45=943. Yes! So the equation would be 19*52 - (39 +6) = 943. Let's verify each number is used once: 19, 52, 39, 6. All used. Operations are multiplication, subtraction, and addition. So that's a valid equation.\n</think>\n\n<answer>19 * 52 - (39 + 6) = 943</answer>"}]}

Let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, let's see what 35 is. It's a relatively small number compared to the numbers given. The numbers I have to use are all quite large except for 4. Maybe I can find a way to subtract or divide the big numbers to get closer to 35, and then use the 4 somehow.\n\nLet me list the numbers again: 373, 81, 415, 4. All must be used once. Hmm.\n\nLet me think about division first. If I can divide two numbers to get a smaller number, maybe that's a way. For example, 415 divided by something. Let's see: 415 divided by 4 is about 103.75. That's still too big. 415 divided by 81 is about 5.123. Maybe that's useful. Then maybe subtract that from something else?\n\nAlternatively, 373 minus 81 is 292. Still too big. 415 minus 373 is 42. Close to 35. Oh, that's 42. If I can get 42 and then subtract 7 more, but where would 7 come from? Maybe 81 divided by something. Wait, 81 divided by 4 is 20.25. If I subtract that from 42, that would be 42 - 20.25 = 21.75. Not helpful.\n\nWait, 415 - 373 = 42. Then 81 divided by 4 is 20.25. So 42 - (81/4) = 21.75. Not 35. Maybe other combinations.\n\nWhat if I do 373 divided by something? 373/4 is 93.25. 415 minus that is 415 - 93.25 = 321.75. Still too big. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, 81 minus 4 is 77. Then maybe 415 - 373 = 42. 77 - 42 = 35. Wait, that's 81 -4 =77, then 415 -373=42, then 77-42=35. But how do I combine all these? Because I have to use all numbers once. Let's see: (81 -4) - (415 -373) = 77 -42=35. But that uses 81,4,415,373. All four numbers. Let me check:\n\n(81 - 4) - (415 - 373) = ?\n\nFirst compute 81-4=77.\n\nThen 415-373=42.\n\nThen 77-42=35. Yes, that works. So the equation would be (81 -4) - (415 -373) =35.\n\nLet me verify each number is used once: 81,4,415,373. Yes, all four. Operations are subtraction and subtraction. So that's acceptable. So the equation is (81 - 4) - (415 - 373) =35.\n\nWait, let me compute that again step by step to be sure.\n\nFirst part: 81 minus 4 is 77. Second part: 415 minus 373 is 42. Then 77 minus 42 equals 35. Correct.\n\nSo that's the equation. Let me write that as (81 - 4) - (415 - 373) = 35. But let me check if there's any other possible way, just to be thorough.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using multiplication or division. For example, 373 - (415 / (81 -4)) ?\n\nWait, 81 -4 is 77. Then 415 divided by 77 is approximately 5.389. Then 373 -5.389 is way too big. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, (415 - 373) * (4) -81. Let's compute: 415-373=42. 42*4=168. 168-81=87. Not 35.\n\nAnother approach: 373 divided by 4 is about 93.25. 415 - 93.25 is 321.75. Then subtract 81? 321.75-81=240.75. Not close.\n\nOr maybe 81 divided by 4 is 20.25. 373 -20.25=352.75. Then 415 -352.75=62.25. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 373 - (81 * 4) = 373 -324=49. Then 415 -49=366. Not helpful.\n\nWait, 415 - (373 +81) =415 -454= -39. Then multiply by 4? That's -156. Not helpful.\n\nHmm. Another angle: Maybe 4 multiplied by some combination. For example, 4*(something)=35. But 35 is not divisible by 4. So maybe 35 is achieved via division. Like (something)/something else =35. Let me see. For example, 35*4=140. Maybe if there's a way to get 140 from 373, 81, 415. But 373 - 81=292, 415-373=42, not 140.\n\nAlternatively, 81 +4=85. 415 - 373=42. Then 85 -42=43. Close but not 35.\n\nWait, but the earlier solution works. Let me just confirm once again. Using all numbers once:\n\n81,4,415,373. In the equation (81 -4) - (415 -373), yes, each number is used once, and all are used. The result is 35. So that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(81 - 4) - (415 - 373) = 35</answer>"}]}

All numbers must be used once, and I can only use basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division. Hmm. Let me start by listing out the numbers and thinking about possible combinations.\n\nFirst, 404 is a pretty big number. Maybe I can build around that. If I can get 404 plus something to reach 694, then the difference would be 694 - 404 = 290. So I need to make 290 using 3, 6, and 61. Wait, but 61 is also a large number. Let me see. Let's try combinations of 61 and the others. 61 multiplied by something. 61 times 5 is 305, which is too big. 61 times 4 is 244. Hmm, 244. If I can get 244 from 61 and the remaining numbers, but the remaining numbers are 3 and 6. How? 6 times 3 is 18. 61 times (6 - 3) would be 61*3=183. Not enough. Alternatively, 61*(6/3) is 61*2=122. Still not 244. Maybe subtraction or addition. Let's think differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe multiply 404 by something. 404 * 2 is 808. That's over 694. 404 * 1.7 would be around 686.8, which is close to 694 but not exact. But we can't use decimals here. So maybe division. 404 divided by something? 404 / 3 is about 134.666, which might not help. 404 /6 is around 67.333. Not sure. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe subtract something from 404 and then multiply. For example, 404 - 3 = 401. Then 401 * something. Let's see, 401 * 1.7 is around 681.7. Not helpful. Or 404 -61= 343. Then 343 * 2 =686. Still not 694. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe combine 61 and 6 first. 61 +6=67. Then 67*10.5= 703.5. But we don't have a 10.5. Alternatively, 61*6=366. Then 366 + 404=770. That's way over. Then subtract 3? 770 -3=767. Not helpful.\n\nWait, let's try another approach. Let's think about the target number 694. Let's see if it's divisible by any of the given numbers. 694 divided by 61 is about 11.377. Not a whole number. 694 divided by 6 is about 115.666. Divided by 3 is about 231.333. Divided by 404 is about 1.718. So maybe not straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use multiplication and addition. Let's see. Let's take 404 and 61. 404 +61=465. Then we have 6 and 3 left. 465 + (6*3) = 465 +18=483. Not enough. Hmm. Alternatively, 404 -61=343. Then 343 + (6*3)=343+18=361. No.\n\nWhat if we do 61*6=366. Then 366 + 3=369. Then 404 + 369=773. Not helpful. Wait, 404 minus something. 404 - (61*3) = 404 -183=221. Then 221 *6=1326. Way too big. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe use division. For example, 404 divided by 6 is approximately 67.333. Then 67.333 *10 would be 673.33. Close to 694, but not exact. Wait, but maybe 61 divided by 3 is approximately 20.333. Then 404 + 20.333 = 424.333. Then 424.333 * 6 = 2546. Doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, 6 divided by 3 is 2. Then 61 *2=122. 404 +122=526. 526 +6=532. Wait, but I already used 6. No, the numbers can only be used once. So that's not allowed. Wait, maybe 61*(6/3) = 61*2=122. Then 404 +122=526. Then I still have the original 6 and 3? Wait, no, because 6 and 3 were already used in the division. So you can't use them again. So after using 6 and 3 for 6/3, then you have 404, 61, 6, and 3. Wait, no, if you used 6 and 3 for 6/3, then you can't use them again. So the remaining numbers would be 404 and 61. Then 404 + (61*(6/3)) = 404 + 122 =526. That's not 694. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 404 + (61*3) = 404 +183=587. Then add 6? 587+6=593. Still not. Or multiply by 6? 587*6=3522. Way off.\n\nWhat if I subtract something from 404. Let's say 404 - (61-6) = 404 -55=349. Then multiply by 3? 349*3=1047. No. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps using multiple operations. Let's see. Let's try (404 + 61) = 465. Then 465 * (6/3) = 465 *2=930. That's more than 694. How to reduce. Hmm. 930 - something. But what numbers are left? If I used 404,61,6,3 in that equation, then all numbers are used. So that gives 930. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (404 * 6) = 2424. Then subtract (61*3)=183. 2424 -183=2241. No, that's way off.\n\nWait, 61*6=366. Then 366*2=732. If we can get 2 from 3 and 404. Wait, 404/202=2, but 202 isn't a number here. Alternatively, 6/3=2. Then 366*(6/3)=366*2=732. Then 732 - 404=328. Not helpful. Alternatively, 732 -61=671. Still not.\n\nHmm. Maybe 61*11=671. Wait, 11 from where? 3+6+something? Maybe 3*3=9 +6=15. Not helpful. Wait, but we can only use each number once. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, 6*3=18. Then 61*18=1098. Then 1098 -404=694. Wait, wait! Let me check that. 6*3 is 18. 61*18= 61*10 +61*8=610 +488=1098. Then 1098 -404=694. Oh! That works. Let me check if I used all numbers once: 6, 3, 61, 404. Yes, all used once. The operations are 6*3=18, then 61*18=1098, then 1098-404=694. So the equation would be 61*(6*3) -404 = 694. Let me compute this step by step:\n\nFirst, 6*3=18. Then 61*18=1098. Then 1098-404=694. Yes, that's correct. So the equation is (61 × (6 × 3)) - 404 = 694. Or written as 61*6*3 -404 =694. But need to ensure the order of operations. Since multiplication is associative, the parentheses might not be necessary, but maybe to make it clear. So the equation is (61 * (6 * 3)) - 404 = 694. That's valid and uses all numbers once with the allowed operations.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(61 * (6 * 3)) - 404 = 694</answer>"}]}

Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should note the target is 172. Let me see what combinations of these numbers can get close to that. The numbers are 66, 6, 25, 87. The larger numbers are 66 and 87. Let's see: 87 is bigger than 66. If I add them together, 87 + 66 = 153. That's less than 172. But maybe with the other numbers, 6 and 25, I can adjust.\n\nWait, 153 + 25 = 178, which is over. But then I have to use all numbers. Alternatively, maybe subtract something. For example, 87 + 66 = 153. Then if I subtract 6, that's 147. Hmm, not helpful. Maybe multiply?\n\nAlternatively, maybe 66 * something. Let's see, 66 * 2 is 132. 66 * 3 is 198, which is over. So 66*2.6 is about 172, but we need integers and exact operations. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, 87 * 2 is 174, which is close. How to get 174 minus 2? But I don't have a 2. Let's think.\n\nWait, 25 and 6. If I do 25 - 6 = 19. Then 87 + 66 = 153. 153 + 19 = 172. Oh! That could work. Let me check:\n\n87 + 66 + (25 - 6) = 153 + 19 = 172. Yes! Let me verify using each number once: 87, 66, 25, 6. Yes, each is used once. So the equation would be 87 + 66 + 25 - 6. But wait, adding 25 and subtracting 6 is the same as adding (25 - 6). So the equation is (87 + 66) + (25 - 6) = 153 + 19 = 172.\n\nWait, but can I write this as 87 + 66 + 25 - 6? Since subtraction is involved, but the parentheses are optional here because addition and subtraction are left associative. But maybe to make it clearer, I can write 87 + 66 + (25 - 6). Either way, it uses all numbers once and gets to 172.\n\nLet me check the arithmetic again: 87 + 66 is 153. Then 25 - 6 is 19. 153 + 19 is indeed 172. So that works.\n\nSo the equation would be 87 + 66 + 25 - 6 = 172. Alternatively, with parentheses for clarity: (87 + 66) + (25 - 6) = 172. But the parentheses aren't necessary because addition and subtraction are evaluated left to right. But the problem allows using operations multiple times, so this seems valid.\n\nWait, another thought: Are there any other possible combinations? Let me check another approach just to be sure. Maybe using multiplication or division.\n\nFor example, 87 - 25 = 62. Then 62 * something. 62 * 3 = 186, which is over. 62 * 2.7 is around 167.4, not helpful. Hmm.\n\nOr 66 * 6 = 396. Then subtract 87 and 25? 396 - 87 = 309; 309 -25=284, which is way over. Not helpful.\n\nAnother idea: 87 divided by something. 87 / 6 is 14.5. Then 14.5 * 12 (but we don't have 12). Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, 25 * 6 = 150. Then 150 + 87 = 237. Then 237 - 66 = 171. Close, but not 172. Hmm. Off by one.\n\nWait, 25 * 6 = 150. Then 150 + 87 = 237. If I subtract 65 instead of 66, that would be 172, but we have to use 66. So that's not possible.\n\nAnother angle: 87 + 25 = 112. 112 + 66 = 178. Then 178 - 6 = 172. Wait, that's the same as before. Because 87 + 25 + 66 - 6. Wait, but 87 +25 is 112, +66 is 178, -6 is 172. But in this case, the order would be 87 +25 +66 -6. But that's the same as the previous equation, just grouped differently. So whether you write it as (87 + 66) + (25 -6) or 87 +25 +66 -6, it's the same.\n\nWait, but in that case, all numbers are used once: 87,25,66,6. So yes. So the equation is valid.\n\nSo the answer is 87 + 25 + 66 - 6 = 172. Alternatively, with parentheses, but maybe it's better to write without since it's straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using multiplication. Let's check another possibility. Suppose we do 66 * (something). Let's see, 66 * 2 = 132. Then 132 + 87 = 219. Then 219 - 25 = 194. Still over. 194 -6=188. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 87 - 6 =81. 81 * 2 =162. Then 162 + 10=172. But we need to use 25 and 66. So 81*2 + something. Not helpful.\n\nWait, 25 and 66: 66 -25=41. Then 87 +41=128. 128 + 6=134. Not enough.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, 87 - (6 * something). Let's see, 6 * 25 =150. 87 -150 =-63. Then 66 + (-63)=3. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 87 - (66 /6) =87 -11=76. Then 76 +25=101. No.\n\nAnother approach: 66 + 6=72. Then 72 * something. 72*2=144. 72*2 +25= 169. Then 169 +3=172. But where to get the 3? Not useful.\n\nAlternatively, 25 * 6=150. 150 + (87 -66)=150 +21=171. Close, but again off by 1.\n\nHmm. So seems like the only valid equation is the first one: 87 +66 +25 -6=172. That uses all numbers once with + and - operations. Let me verify once again:\n\n87 +66 = 153\n\n25 -6 =19\n\n153 +19=172. Yep, correct.\n\nSo that's the equation.\n</think>\n\n<answer>87 + 66 + 25 - 6 = 172</answer>"}]}

Hmm.\n\nFirst, I should think about how to combine these numbers. 66 is a big number, maybe dividing it by something could help. If I divide 66 by 2, that gives me 33. Oh, wait, that's exactly half of 66. So 66 ÷ 2 = 33. But then I have the two 18s left. How do I use them?

Let's calculate that: 33 + 18 = 51, then 51 - 18 = 33. Oh, that works! Wait, but are the operations allowed to be used like that? Let me check. Yes, using subtraction and addition to cancel out the 18s. So the equation would be (66 / 2) + 18 - 18. But since addition and subtraction are left to right, the parentheses around 66/2 might not be necessary, but to make it clear, maybe include them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way. Let me verify if that's the only possibility. Let's see. Another approach: using multiplication. For example, 18 * 2 = 36. But then I have 66 and 18 left. 66 - 18 = 48. Hmm, not sure how to get 33 from that. Or maybe 66 - (18 * something). Let's see. If I do 66 - (18 * (18 / 2)), but that would be 66 - (18*9) = 66 - 162 = -96, which is way off.\n\nAlternatively, 66 divided by (something). 66 divided by (18 - 18 + 2). Wait, 18 - 18 is 0, so that would be 66 / 2 = 33. But then again, using the two 18s as 18-18=0, which allows me to effectively ignore them. But do I have to use all the numbers? Yes, so even if their net result is zero, I still have to include them. So 66 divided by (2 + (18 - 18)). Because 18-18 is 0, then 2 + 0 = 2. So 66 / 2 = 33. So that's another way: 66 / (2 + (18 - 18)).\n\nWait, but in this case, 18 - 18 is 0, so the equation simplifies to 66 / 2 = 33. But using all numbers: 2, 66, 18, 18. So that works. Let me check the order of operations here. The expression inside the parentheses would be calculated first: 18 - 18 = 0, then 2 + 0 = 2, then 66 / 2 = 33. So that's valid.\n\nSo two possible equations: (66 / 2) + 18 - 18 = 33, or 66 / (2 + 18 - 18) = 33. Both use all numbers once. Let me verify if the second one is acceptable. Since the problem says each number can only be used once, and all must be used. In the second equation, the 18s are used in 18 - 18, which is part of the denominator. So 2 + 18 - 18 equals 2, so denominator is 2, and 66 divided by 2 is 33. That works.\n\nBut which one is better? The first equation uses 66 divided by 2, then adds and subtracts 18. The second uses the 18s in the denominator. Both are valid. But maybe the problem expects a certain structure. Let me check the problem statement again: you must use all the numbers, each once. So either equation works. Let's pick one. The second one might be more efficient: 66 divided by (2 + 18 - 18) = 33. So the equation is 66/(2 + 18 - 18) = 33. Alternatively, written as 66/(2 + (18 - 18)) = 33. The parentheses help clarify the order.\n\nAnother way: 66 / (2 + 18 - 18). Let me compute that again step by step. 18 - 18 = 0, 2 + 0 = 2, then 66 /2 =33. Yes, that's correct. So that uses all four numbers, each exactly once. Perfect.\n\nAlternatively, the first equation uses 66/2 +18-18. That's also valid. Both equations use all numbers once and result in 33. So either is acceptable. But maybe the second one is more concise. Let me present that. So the answer would be 66/(2 + 18 - 18) = 33. Or with parentheses as needed.\n</think>\n\n<answer>66 / (2 + 18 - 18)</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using the numbers 100, 12, 528, and 4, each exactly once, with basic operations to get 476. Hmm. Let me start by thinking about the target number, 476. It's close to 500, so maybe subtract something from 500. Wait, I have 100 in the numbers. Maybe 100 multiplied by something. But 100*4 is 400, which is lower. 100*5 is 500, but 5 isn't one of the numbers. Alternatively, 528 is a big number. Let's see. If I use 528 minus something. 528 - 52 would be 476. Do I have a way to make 52 with the remaining numbers 100, 12, 4? Let me check. 12*4 is 48, and then plus 4... No, wait, I have to use all numbers. Wait, if I do 528 minus (something) equals 476, then the something is 52. How can I get 52 from 100, 12, and 4? Hmm. Maybe 100 divided by something. 100 divided by (12 - 4) is 100/8=12.5, which isn't helpful. Or maybe 12*4 is 48, then plus 100? No, that's 148. That's way too big. Wait, but if I subtract that from 528: 528 - (100 + 12*4) = 528 - (100+48)=528-148=380. Not 476. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, what if I use 528 minus 100. That gives 428. Then I need to add 48 to get 476. 48 is 12*4. So 528 - 100 + (12*4). Let's check that: 528-100=428; 12*4=48; 428+48=476. Yes! Wait, that uses all numbers: 528, 100, 12, 4. The operations are -, +, and *. So the equation would be 528 - 100 + 12*4. Let me verify again: multiplication first, 12*4=48. Then 528-100 is 428, plus 48 is 476. Perfect. That works. So the equation is 528 - 100 + 12 * 4 = 476. Let me just check if all numbers are used once: 528, 100, 12, 4. Yes, each once. And all operations are allowed.

I need to create an equation using all the numbers 93, 80, 10, and 28 exactly once, and the result should be 822. The operations allowed are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Hmm, how to approach this?\n\nFirst, maybe I should think about the target number, 822. It's a pretty large number, so multiplication is probably involved here. Let's see what combinations might get close. Let's list out the numbers: 93, 80, 10, 28.\n\nIf I multiply the two largest numbers, 93 and 80, that's 93*80 = 7440. That's way too big. But maybe if I subtract something from that? Wait, 7440 minus something... but even subtracting the next largest number, 28, would still give 7440 -28=7412, which is way over. So maybe that's not the way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe divide one of the larger numbers to make them smaller. For example, 93 divided by something? If I divide 93 by 10, that's 9.3. Then multiply by 80? 9.3*80=744. Hmm, still not enough. Then add 28? 744+28=772. Still not 822. Or multiply by 28? 9.3*28=260.4, then add 80? 260.4+80=340.4. Nope, that's too low.\n\nWait, what if I use subtraction and multiplication together. Let's see, 93 minus 80 is 13. Then 13 multiplied by something. If I take 13*10=130, then add 28, that's 158. Not close. Maybe 13*28=364, then add 10? 374. Still no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 80 minus 10 is 70, then 70 multiplied by something. 70*28=1960, then subtract 93? 1960-93=1867. No, too big.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to combine operations in a different way. Let's think of 93 and 80 as possible main components. If I do 93*10=930, then subtract something. 930 - (80-28). Let's calculate that: 80-28=52, so 930-52=878. Still not 822. Hmm, 930 minus 108? But where would 108 come from? Wait, 28 and 80. 80+28=108. So 930-108=822. Oh! Wait, that could work. Let's check if I can use all numbers once.\n\n93*10=930. Then subtract (80+28)=108. 930-108=822. But that uses all numbers: 93,10,80,28. Yes! Let me verify:\n\n93 * 10 = 930\n\n80 + 28 = 108\n\n930 - 108 = 822. Exactly the target number. So the equation would be 93*10 - (80+28) = 822. Let me check if all numbers are used once: 93, 10, 80, 28. Yep, all four used. Each only once. And the operations are multiplication, addition, and subtraction.

Let's think about possible operations. 105 is a number that's not too big, so maybe starting with some subtraction or addition.\n\nLet's see: 98 is a big number. If I subtract something from it, maybe. 98 - 67 = 31. Then I have 60 and 1 left. 31 + 60 is 91, plus 1 is 92. Not enough. Hmm. Alternatively, 98 + 60 = 158. That's way over.

Then maybe 127 - something. The remaining numbers are 98 and 1. 127 -98=29, plus 1=30. Not useful.\n\nWait, maybe division can help. Let's see. If I can get a division to make a number that can combine with others. For example, 98 divided by something. 98 divided by 1 is 98. Then 98 + 67 =165, minus 60=105. Wait, that might work. Let me check:\n\n98 / 1 =98. Then 98 +67 =165. Then 165 -60=105. But have I used all numbers? Let's see: 98,1,67,60. Yes, all four. Each used once. That seems to fit.

Hmm, let's start by looking at the target number. 656. Let's see what factors 656 has. Well, 656 divided by 8 is 82. Wait, 8 times 82 is 656. Oh, that's interesting. Because 8 and 82 are both in the numbers we have. So maybe if I can use 8 and 82 multiplied together, that gives 656. But then I need to use the other numbers, 908 and 908. But the problem says I have to use all the numbers. So if I do 8*82=656, then what do I do with the two 908s? Maybe I can subtract or add them in a way that cancels out? Let's think. If I have 908 - 908, that's zero. Then adding that to 8*82 would just give 656. So maybe (8*82) + (908 - 908). Let's check: 8*82 is 656, 908-908 is 0, so total is 656. That works! All numbers are used once: 8, 82, 908, 908. And operations are multiplication and subtraction (or addition, since adding zero). Let me just confirm the order and parentheses. So the equation would be 8*82 + 908 - 908. Because addition and subtraction are left to right, but in this case, since 908-908 is zero, it doesn't affect the result. Alternatively, grouping them as (8*82) + (908 - 908) makes it clearer. But either way, the calculation should result in 656. Let me verify:\n\n8 * 82 = 656. Then 908 - 908 = 0. Adding them together: 656 + 0 = 656. Perfect. So that's the equation. All numbers are used once, and the operations are allowed. So the equation is (8 * 82) + (908 - 908) = 656. Alternatively, since the subtraction and addition are associative, it could be written as 8*82 + 908 - 908. Either way, the result is the same. So I think that's the solution. Let me just make sure there's no other way. Another approach might involve combining the 908s first. For example, 908 / 908 is 1. Then maybe 82 * (8 + 1) = 82*9=738, which isn't 656. Not helpful. Or 908 + 908 = 1816. Then maybe 1816 divided by something. 1816 / (82 -8) = 1816/74 ≈24.54, which isn't helpful. Alternatively, 82 * 8 = 656, then dealing with the 908s by subtracting each other.

All numbers must be used exactly once, and I can only use basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Hmm, where to start?\n\nFirst, I'll list out the numbers: 79, 35, 486, 78. The target is 451. Let me think about how these numbers can combine. Since 486 is the largest number, maybe I can subtract something from it to get closer to 451. Let's see: 486 - 35 = 451. Wait, that's exactly 451! But wait, if I do 486 - 35, that gives me 451, but then I still have 79 and 78 left, which I haven't used. Oh right, I have to use all the numbers.\n\nSo that approach alone doesn't work. Maybe I need to combine some of the other numbers first. Let's think about the other numbers. 79 and 78 are close to each other. Maybe subtracting them: 79 - 78 = 1. Then, combining that with 35. Hmm, but 1 and 35 could be 36 or 34, but how does that relate to 486? Let's see. If I take 486 - 35 = 451 (as before), but then I need to use 79 and 78. Wait, maybe I can multiply 79 and 78, but that's way too big. 79*78 is like 6162. Definitely too big. Maybe divide?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps combining 78 and 35 first. Let's see, 78 + 35 = 113. Then, 486 - 113 = 373. Not close. 486 - (78 + 35) = 373. Then, adding 79 would get 373 +79=452. Oh, that's very close to 451. But it's 452. Maybe I can adjust. Let me check: 486 - (78 + 35) = 486 - 113 = 373. Then 373 +79=452. Hmm, one over. Maybe if I subtract instead? 373 -79=294. Not helpful.\n\nAnother approach: what if I divide some numbers? For example, 486 divided by something. Let's see, 486 / 78 is approximately 6.23. If I then multiply that by 35, that's around 218.05, which isn't helpful. Alternatively, 486 / 35 is around 13.8857. Not sure if that helps. What about 79 divided by 35? That's about 2.257. Then multiply by 78? 2.257*78 ≈ 176. Not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps combining 486 and 78 first. 486 - 78 = 408. Then 408 + 35 = 443. Then 443 + 79 = 522. Too high. Alternatively, 486 +78=564. Then 564 -35=529, minus 79=450. Oh, that's 450. Close but one less. Wait, 564 -35=529, then 529 -79=450. So 486 +78 -35 -79=450. But we need 451. So maybe if we can arrange the operations differently. For example, maybe 486 + (78 -35) -79. Let's calculate that: 78-35=43. Then 486 +43=529. 529-79=450. Still 450. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 486 - (78 -35) -79. 78-35=43. 486-43=443. 443-79=364. Not helpful.\n\nWhat if I group 78 and 79 together? Like 78 +79=157. Then 486 -157=329. Then 329 +35=364. No. Or 486 +157=643, minus 35=608. Not helpful.\n\nWhat if I multiply some numbers? Let's see. For example, 35 * 78=2730. That's way too big. Maybe 35 * (79 -78)=35*1=35. Then 486 -35=451. Wait, that's possible! Let's check: 79 -78=1. Then 35*1=35. Then 486 -35=451. So the equation would be 486 - 35*(79 -78) =451. Let me verify: 79-78=1. 35*1=35. 486-35=451. Yes! That works.

Maybe I can break it down into factors or see what combinations could lead to 18. 18 is 3*6, 2*9, 18*1, or maybe 24-6, 30-12, etc. Let me see how the given numbers can be manipulated to get these components.\n\nLooking at the numbers: 53, 42, 17, 12. Let me note their values. 53 is a prime number, so it might be tricky to divide. 42 is 6*7, but again, not sure. 17 is prime, and 12 is 3*4. Maybe I can find a way to subtract or add some to get to 18.\n\nLet me try combinations. For example, maybe subtract two large numbers to get a smaller number. 53 - 42 = 11. Then, 17 - 12 = 5. 11 +5=16, which isn't 18. Hmm. Alternatively, 53 -17=36, and 42-12=30. 36 -30=6. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe multiply or divide. Let's see. 42 divided by something. 42 / 12 is 3.5. If I do 42 / (17-12) = 42 /5 = 8.4. Then, 53 - (42/5) would be complicated. Not sure.\n\nAnother approach: 53 + 42 is 95. Then 17 +12=29. 95 -29=66. No. Not helpful. Alternatively, 53 -42=11. Then 11 +17=28. 28 -12=16. Still no.\n\nWait, maybe using division. Let's see. If I can get 42 divided by something to make 3.5, but maybe combine it with others. For example, 53 - (42 / (17 -12)). Let's calculate that: 17-12=5. 42/5=8.4. 53-8.4=44.6. Not 18. \n\nAlternatively, (53 -17) =36. Then 36 divided by (42-12)=30. 36/30=1.2. Not 18.\n\nWait, perhaps (42 -12) =30. Then 30 -17=13. 53 -13=40. No. Not helpful.\n\nWhat if I do 53 -17 -12 =24. Then 24 -42= -18. But we need positive 18. Maybe 42 - (53 -17 -12)=42 -24=18. Wait, that might work. Let me check:\n\n53 -17 -12 = 24. Then 42 -24=18. So the equation would be 42 - (53 -17 -12) =18. But does this use all numbers? Let's see: 53,17,12 are used in the parentheses, and 42 outside. Yes, all four numbers. So that would be 42 - (53 -17 -12) =18. Let me compute that: 53-17=36, 36-12=24. 42-24=18. Yes! That works. So the equation is 42 - (53 - 17 -12) =18. Let me verify again:\n\n53 minus 17 is 36. 36 minus 12 is 24. Then 42 minus 24 equals 18. Correct. All numbers used once. Perfect. So the equation is 42 - (53 -17 -12) =18.\n</think>\n\n<answer>42 - (53 - 17 - 12) = 18</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using the numbers 21, 3, 82, and 32 exactly once each, with basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) to get 798. Hmm, okay. Let's start by thinking about how these numbers can combine.\n\nFirst, 798 is a pretty large number. Let me check what 82 multiplied by something gets close. 82 * 10 is 820, which is more than 798. Maybe subtract something from that? But how to get 10 using the remaining numbers. Wait, the remaining numbers are 21, 3, 32. Let's see. 32 - 21 is 11, then 11 - 3 is 8. Not helpful. Alternatively, 21 + 3 = 24. Then 32 - 24 = 8. Still not 10. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe multiply 82 by 9. 82*9 is 738. Then 798 - 738 = 60. But how to get 60 from the remaining numbers 21, 3, 32. Wait, 32 + 21 = 53, plus 3 is 56. Not 60. Or 32*3=96, which is way over. Maybe subtract? 32*3 is 96, 96 - 21 = 75. Not helpful.\n\nAnother approach: 798 divided by 82 is approximately 9.73. So maybe 82 multiplied by (something around 9.73). Let's see. If I can make 82*(21 + 3) would be 82*24 = 1968, way too big. No. What if I subtract numbers? 82*(32 - something). Let's see: 32 - 21 = 11. 82*11=902. 902 -3=899, not 798. Hmm.\n\nWait, 798 divided by 21 is 38. So 21*38=798. Can I make 38 from 3,82,32? Let's check. 82 - 32 = 50. 50 - 3 =47. Not 38. 32 +3=35. 82-35=47. Not helpful. 82/ something. 82/ (32-3) = 82/29 ≈2.827. Then 21*2.827≈59.3. Not 798. Hmm.\n\nWhat if I use multiplication and addition. Let's see 21*32=672. Then 798-672=126. Need to make 126 from 3 and 82. 82*3=246, which is too big. 82+3=85. 85 is not 126. 82-3=79. No. Hmm. Maybe 82* (3 + something). But I don't have other numbers left. So that might not work.\n\nAnother angle: 32*21=672. Then 82*3=246. 672 +246=918. That's over. 918 - 120=798. Wait, but where would 120 come from? I've already used all numbers. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe combine 82 and 32. 82 +32=114. Then 114*7=798. But how to get 7 from 21 and 3. 21/3=7. Oh! So 82 +32=114, then 114*(21/3)=114*7=798. Let me check: 21 divided by 3 is 7. Then 82 plus 32 is 114. Multiply those together: 114 *7 = 798. Yes! That works. Let me verify all numbers are used once: 21,3,82,32. Yep. Operations are +, /, *. All allowed. So the equation would be (82 +32) * (21 /3) = 114 *7 =798. Perfect!\n</think>\n\n<answer>(82 + 32) * (21 / 3)</answer>"}]}

Let me start by writing down the numbers and thinking about possible operations.\n\nFirst, maybe I can look for a way to get close to 543. Let's see, 639 is a big number. If I subtract something from 639, maybe? 639 minus what? Let's check: 639 - 60 = 579. Still higher than 543. 639 - 97 = 542. Oh, that's very close to 543. Wait, 542 is just one less than 543. But I have to use all numbers, so maybe adjust that. But then I still have 59 left. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe multiply some numbers. Let's see. 60 * 9 is 540, which is close. How can I get 9? 639 divided by 71 is 9, but 71 isn't one of the numbers. Wait, the numbers are 60, 639, 97, 59. If I use 639 divided by something. Let's see 639 divided by 60 is about 10.65, which isn't helpful. 639 divided by 59 is about 10.83. Not helpful either. 639 divided by 97 is approximately 6.59. Not sure.\n\nWhat if I subtract 97 from 639? 639 - 97 = 542. Then maybe add 1, but I don't have 1. But I have 59 and 60. How can I get 1 from 59 and 60? 60 - 59 = 1. So 639 - 97 + (60 - 59) = 542 + 1 = 543. Wait, that uses all the numbers: 639, 97, 60, 59. Let me check:\n\n639 - 97 = 542. Then 60 - 59 = 1. So 542 + 1 = 543. But how do I combine these operations? The equation would be 639 - 97 + 60 - 59 = 543. Wait, does that work? Let me compute step by step:\n\n639 - 97 = 542\n\n542 + 60 = 602\n\n602 - 59 = 543. Oh, right! So 639 - 97 + 60 - 59 = 543. But that uses all four numbers once each. Let me verify the arithmetic:\n\n639 minus 97 is 542. Then adding 60 gives 602. Subtracting 59 from 602 gives 543. Yes, that works. So the equation is (639 - 97) + 60 - 59 = 543. But since the operations are left to right, maybe parentheses aren't needed. So 639 - 97 + 60 - 59 = 543. Let me check again:\n\n639 -97 = 542\n\n542 +60=602\n\n602-59=543. Yep. So that's a valid equation using all numbers once with basic operations. Let me just make sure there's no other combination. Another approach: Maybe multiply. For example, 60 * 9 = 540, then add 3. But where to get 9 and 3? 60* (97 - 59)/something? Wait 97 -59 is 38. 60*38 is 2280, which is way too big. Alternatively, 639 divided by something. 639 / 97 is about 6.59. Not helpful. 639 - (59 + 60) = 639 - 119 = 520. Then add 23? But where to get 23 from 97? Doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, 97 * 5 = 485. 485 + 58 = 543. But where to get 5 and 58? Maybe 60 - (59/ something). 59 divided by 59 is 1. Then 60 -1 =59. But that's not helpful. Maybe 97 * 5 + 58. 5 could be from 60 -55, but 55 isn't present. Not sure.\n\nAnother idea: 60 + 59 = 119. Then 639 - 119 = 520. Then 520 + 23 =543. But 23 would have to come from 97 somehow. 97 divided by something. 97 divided by 4.2, which isn't possible here. Not helpful.\n\nSo back to the first solution: 639 -97 +60 -59. That seems to work. Let me check the order again. If I write it as 639 +60 -97 -59. Does that also work? 639 +60=699. 699 -97=602. 602-59=543. Yes, same result. So the equation can be written as 639 + 60 -97 -59 =543. That's another way to arrange the numbers. But all numbers are used once. So either way, it's valid. So the answer could be written as 639 +60 -97 -59=543. Or (639 +60) - (97 +59) = 699 - 156 =543. That works too. So yes, combining the numbers as 639 +60 = 699, and 97 +59=156. Then 699-156=543. So the equation is (639 +60) - (97 +59) =543. That's another way to present it. But the question allows using basic operations, so either form is acceptable.\n\nBut the problem requires that each number is used once, and all are used. So in this case, 639 +60 -97 -59 uses all numbers once. So the equation would be 639 + 60 - 97 - 59 = 543. That's correct. Let me double-check all numbers: 639, 60, 97, 59. All used once, yes. The operations are addition and subtraction. So this should be the correct answer.\n</think>\n\n<answer>639 + 60 - 97 - 59 = 543</answer>"}]}

I need to see how these numbers can combine to reach it.\n\nFirst, maybe subtract some numbers. Let's see: 69 is close to 87. If I take 69 and add something. 69 + 18 would get to 87, but do I have 18? Not directly. Maybe subtract another number. Wait, 69 + (60 - 39) = 69 +21=90. Close but not 87. Alternatively, 69 + (57 - 39) = 69 +18=87. Oh, wait! That uses 69, 57, 39. Then what about the 60? Wait, but in that case, 60 isn't used. So maybe that approach won't work because we need to use all numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe multiply or divide. Let's see. 60 is a big number. 60 + 27 would be 87. How to get 27? 57 - 30 =27. But 30 isn't directly available. Wait, 39 - (60 / something). Let's think. 60 divided by 5 is 12, but 5 isn't here. Alternatively, 39 - (60 / (57 - something)). Hmm, getting complicated.\n\nWait, another angle: 57 + 30 =87. How to get 30? 60 / 2 =30. But do I have a 2? Maybe from 39 - 37, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, 69 - 39 =30. So 57 + (69 -39) =57 +30=87. That uses 57, 69, 39. Then the remaining number is 60. How to incorporate that? Oh, maybe subtract 60, but that would lower the total. Wait, if I do 57 + (69 -39) -60, that would be 57 +30 -60=27. Not helpful. Alternatively, maybe multiply or divide. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the equation can be structured with parentheses. Let's try (69 - (60 / (57 - 39))). Let's compute that. First, 57 -39=18. Then 60 /18≈3.333. Then 69 -3.333≈65.666. Not close. Alternatively, (69 + 60) - (57 -39). Let's see: 129 -18=111. No.\n\nWhat about (57 + 60) - (69 -39). 117 -30=87. Oh! Wait, that works. Let's check: 57 +60=117. Then 69 -39=30. Then 117 -30=87. Yes! So the equation is (57 +60) - (69 -39)=87. Let me verify all numbers are used once: 57,60,69,39. Yes, all used. The operations are addition and subtraction. So that should be the equation.

That uses all four numbers: 846, 2, 60, 2. But the two 2s are separate. So the equation would be (846 / 2) - 60 - 2 = 423 - 60 - 2 = 361. Yes, that works.

Alternatively, if I do 91 - (85 - something). Let's see: 91 - 85 is 6, which is not helpful. Maybe 85 - (something). 85 - 63 = 22. Then 88 - 22 = 66.

So maybe 238 * 2.8... but we can't use decimals. Wait, maybe 238 multiplied by something else. Let me see the other numbers: 5, 4, 7.\n\nWhat if I do 5 * 4 = 20. Then 238 + 20 = 258. That's not helpful. Alternatively, 238 * (5 + 4 +7) = 238*16=3808. Way too big. Hmm.\n\nWait, 680 divided by 238 is approximately 2.857. That's close to 20/7, which is about 2.857. So maybe 238 * (20/7) = 680. Let me check: 20/7 is roughly 2.857, and 238*2.857≈680. Exactly, 238*(20/7) = 238*(20)/7 = (238/7)*20. 238 divided by 7 is 34, because 7*34=238. So 34*20=680. Oh, that works!\n\nSo the equation would be (238 / 7) * (5 * 4). Let me verify each step. 238 divided by 7 is 34. Then 5 multiplied by 4 is 20. 34 multiplied by 20 is 680. Yes! And all numbers are used once: 238, 7, 5, and 4. The operations are division, multiplication, and multiplication. So the equation is (238 / 7) * 5 * 4. Wait, but parentheses matter. Let me make sure. If I write (238 / 7) * (5 * 4) that would be 34 * 20 = 680. Alternatively, (238 / 7) * 5 *4 is the same since multiplication is associative. Either way, all numbers are used once. So the equation is (238 / 7) * 5 * 4 = 680. Let me check again: 238 ÷7=34, 34×5=170, 170×4=680. Yes. Perfect.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(238 / 7) * 5 * 4</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using the numbers 46, 7, 82, and 76 exactly once each, with basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) any number of times, and the result should be 197. Hmm, let's start by thinking about the target number, 197. It's a prime number, so maybe addition or subtraction isn't straightforward. Let me check the numbers I have: 46, 7, 82, 76. \n\nFirst, let me try to see if I can combine some of the larger numbers. For example, 82 and 76 are both large. If I subtract them, 82 - 76 = 6, which might be too small. Adding them would give 158, which is still less than 197. If I multiply 82 and 76, that's way too big (82*76=6232), so probably not helpful. \n\nWhat about 46 and 76? Adding them gives 122, subtracting gives -30, which is not useful. Multiplying would be 3496, too big. Dividing 76 by 46 is about 1.65, not helpful. \n\nWait, maybe combining 82 and 46. Let's see, 82 + 46 = 128. Then if I add 76, that's 204. Hmm, 204 is close to 197. If I subtract 7 from 204, that's 197. Wait, let me check: 82 + 46 = 128; 128 +76=204; 204 -7=197. Oh, but I have to use all numbers exactly once, and that uses all four numbers. Let me verify: 82 +46 +76 -7 = 197. Let's compute step by step:\n\n82 + 46 = 128\n\n128 +76 = 204\n\n204 -7 = 197. Yes! That works. So the equation would be (82 + 46 + 76) - 7 = 197. But since addition and subtraction are left to right, maybe parentheses aren't necessary. Alternatively, 82 + 46 + 76 -7 = 197. But I need to check if that's the case.\n\nWait, let me compute 82 +46 first: 82+46=128. Then 128+76=204. Then 204-7=197. Yes, correct. So the equation is 82 + 46 +76 -7 =197. All numbers used once, and operations are + and -. \n\nBut wait, the problem requires using all numbers once. Let me check: 82, 46, 76, and 7 are all used. Yes. So that's the equation. So maybe the answer is simply 82 + 46 + 76 - 7 = 197. Let me just confirm that again. 82+46 is 128, plus76 is 204, minus7 is 197. Exactly. So that's the solution.\n</think>\n\n<answer>82 + 46 + 76 - 7 = 197</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using the numbers 22, 27, 69, and 1 exactly once each, with basic operations, to get 663. Hmm. First, I should think about what operations can combine these numbers effectively.\n\nSince 663 is a fairly large number, multiplication might be necessary. Let me check the products of some combinations. Let's see: 69 is the largest number here. If I multiply 69 by something, maybe that could get me close. 69 times 10 is 690, which is higher than 663. But if I subtract something from that, maybe? Let me try 69*10 - something. Wait, but I need to use 22, 27, and 1. Alternatively, maybe 69 multiplied by 9 or so. Let me check 69*9=621. Then 621 + 42 would be 663, but I don't have 42. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, 27 is another number. Let's see. 27 times 24.5 is about 661.5, close to 663, but not exact. Not helpful. Maybe 22*27. Let's compute that: 22*27=594. Then 594 plus 69 is 663. Wait, but then I would have used 22,27,69 and have 1 left. How to incorporate the 1? Because all numbers must be used. So maybe 22*27 +69 -1. Let's calculate that: 594 +69 = 663, minus 1 would be 662. No, that's not right. Alternatively, 22*27 +69 +1= 594+69+1=664. Close, but not 663. So that's off by 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe subtract instead. 22*27=594. Then 594 + (69 -1) = 594 +68=662. Still not 663. Hmm. Not quite.\n\nWait, maybe if I use division. Let's see. 69 divided by 1 is still 69. So 69*(22 +27/ something). Wait, but how? Let me think. Alternatively, maybe 27* (something) + something else. Let me try 27*22=594. Then adding 69 gives 663, but again, then where does the 1 come into play? Because we have to use all numbers. So maybe there's a way to use 1 in a division or subtraction that doesn't affect the total. Like 27*22 +69 +1 -1. But that uses 1 twice, which isn't allowed. Alternatively, perhaps (27 +1)* something. Let's compute 27+1=28. 28*23.71≈663. But I don't have 23.71. Alternatively, 28*23=644. 644 +19=663. But 19 isn't available. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe using 69 and 22. 69 divided by 1 is 69. Then 69*(22 - (27/something)). Let's see. If I do 69*(22 - (27/x)), but I need to use 1 here. Wait, maybe 27 divided by something. If I use 1, then 27/1=27. So 69*(22 -27) =69*(-5)= -345. Not helpful. Alternatively, maybe 69*(22 +27/1). That would be 69*(22+27)=69*49=3381, way too big. Not good.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 69* (27 - something). Let's say 27 -22=5. Then 69*5=345. Then add 1, that's 346. No. Not close.\n\nHmm. Another approach: 663 divided by 69 is approximately 9.608. So if I can make 9.608 using 22,27,1. Not sure. Alternatively, 663 divided by 27 is about 24.555. So maybe 24.555*27=663, but again, how to get 24.555 from 22, 69,1. Not obvious.\n\nWait, maybe subtract two numbers. 69 -22=47. 47*14.1≈663. But 14.1 is not from the remaining numbers. 27 and 1. 27-1=26. 47*14.1 is not helpful. Alternatively, 69-27=42. 42*15.785≈663. Still not helpful.\n\nLet me think again. Let's list possible operations. Maybe a combination of multiplication and addition. For example, (22 + 1) * 27 = 23*27=621. Then 621 +42=663. But 42 isn't available. Unless 69-27=42. Wait, but that uses 69 and 27 again. Wait, but 22,1,27,69. If I do (22 +1) *27 + (69 -27). Wait, but that would use 27 twice. Not allowed. Because each number can be used once.\n\nWait, maybe (22 +1) * something. 22+1=23. 23*28.826≈663. 28.826 is 663/23. But how to get that from 27 and 69. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, 69*(22 - (27 -1)). Let's compute that: 27-1=26. 22-26= -4. 69*(-4)= -276. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 69*(27 -22) +1. That's 69*5 +1=345 +1=346. No.\n\nWait, let's try using division in a way that cancels out a number. For example, (69 -22) * (27 -1). Let's compute 47*26=1222. No, too big.\n\nAlternatively, 27*22 +69*1= 594 +69= 663. Wait, that's exactly 663! Let's check: 27*22 is 594, 69*1 is 69. Then 594 +69=663. And all numbers are used once: 27, 22, 69, 1. Yes! So the equation would be (27 * 22) + (69 * 1) = 663. But let me verify. 27 times 22 is indeed 594. 69 times 1 is 69. 594 +69 is 663. And all numbers are used: 27,22,69,1. Yes! Perfect. So the equation is (27 * 22) + (69 * 1) = 663. So putting it in the required format.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(27 * 22) + (69 * 1) = 663</answer>"}]}

Hmm. First, I should think about what 882 factors into. Let me check. 882 divided by 2 is 441, which is 21 squared. So 882 is 2 * 21². But how does that help with the numbers given?\n\nAlternatively, maybe breaking down each number. Let's look at the numbers: 100 is a big number, 25 is also a factor of 100. 72 is 8*9, and 49 is 7 squared. Maybe combining them in some way. Let's think about multiplication first because 882 is a large number. Let's see what products we can get.\n\nIf I multiply 100 and 25, that's 2500. That's way bigger than 882. So maybe not. How about 72 and 49? 72*49. Let me calculate that: 70*49 = 3430, plus 2*49=98, so total 3528. That's way too big. Hmm. What if I subtract something from that? But then I have to use all numbers. Wait, maybe division or addition.\n\nWait, 72 divided by something... Let's see. Maybe 100 - 25 = 75, then 75 * something. 75*12=900. Not 882. Hmm. 75*11.76 is 882, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe 72 * (something). 72*12.25=882. Wait, 49 is 7 squared. 12.25 is 49/4. Wait, 49 divided by 4 is 12.25. So 72*(49/4) = 72*12.25 = 882. Oh, that's interesting. So if I can get 49 divided by 4. But how do I get 4 from the remaining numbers, which are 100 and 25. 100 - 25 is 75. Not helpful. Alternatively, 100 divided by 25 is 4. Oh! That's right. So 100 divided by 25 is 4. Then 49 divided by (100/25) is 49/4. Then multiply by 72. So putting that together: 72 * (49 / (100 / 25)). Let's check that. 100 divided by 25 is 4. 49 divided by 4 is 12.25. 72 times 12.25 is 882. Perfect. So that uses all the numbers: 72, 49, 100, 25. Each used once. So the equation would be 72 * (49 / (100 / 25)) = 882. Let me verify the calculation step by step. 100 divided by 25 is 4. Then 49 divided by 4 is 12.25. Multiply by 72: 72*12.25. 72*12 is 864, plus 72*0.25 is 18. So 864+18=882. Yes, that works. So the equation is 72 × (49 ÷ (100 ÷ 25)) = 882. That uses all numbers once with division and multiplication. Let me check again. Numbers used: 72, 49, 100, 25. All are used once. Operations are division inside the parentheses, then division again, then multiplication. Yep, that should work. So the answer would be (72 * 49) / (100 / 25), but wait, actually the parentheses matter. Let me make sure the order is correct. The original expression is 72 * (49 / (100 /25)). Which is same as 72 * 49 / (100 /25). But maybe written as 72 × (49 ÷ (100 ÷ 25)). So the equation is (72 * 49) / (100 /25) equals 882. Alternatively, 72 * 49 / (100 /25) = (72*49*25)/100. Let's compute that: (72*49*25)/100. Let's compute 72*25 first. 72*25 is 1800. Then 1800*49. 1800*49 = 88,200. Then divide by 100: 882. Yep. So that works. So the equation is (72 × 49 × 25) / 100. But wait, but in that case, it's written as (72 * 25 *49)/100. But in terms of order of operations, maybe the way I originally thought with parentheses is better. So the equation can be written as 72 * (49 / (100 / 25)). That way, each operation is clear. So that uses all numbers once. Therefore, that's the answer.\n</think>\n\n<answer>72 * (49 / (100 / 25)) = 882</answer>"}]}

Let's think about the target number, 188. It's double 94, which is one of the numbers here. Wait, 94 multiplied by 2 gives 188. Oh, but I have to use all numbers. So if I do 94 * 2, that uses 94 and 2, but leaves the two 66s. How can I involve the 66s?\n\nWait, maybe there's a way to combine the 66s with the other numbers. Let me see. If I subtract 66 from 66, that gives zero. Then adding that to 94 * 2 would just be 188. So 94 * 2 + (66 - 66) = 188 + 0 = 188. That uses all numbers: 94, 2, 66, and 66. Each once. But wait, are both 66s allowed to be used? The problem says \"using the numbers 94, 66, 2, 66\"—so there are two 66s, and each can be used once. So that's okay. Let me check: 94 * 2 is 188, then plus (66-66) which is 0. Total is 188. That works. So the equation would be (94 * 2) + (66 - 66) = 188. Alternatively, maybe parentheses can be arranged differently, but that seems valid. Let me verify:\n\n94 * 2 = 188.\n\n66 - 66 = 0.\n\n188 + 0 = 188. Yes, that's correct.

What if I subtract 66 from something? Like 94 + 66 = 160, then subtract 66, which would be 94 + 66 - 66 = 94, and then multiply by 2? Wait, 94 + (66 - 66) = 94, then 94 * 2 = 188. But that's the same as before. But the problem says each number can be used once. Wait, in this case, 94 is used once, 66 twice (each allowed), and 2 once. So that works. So that's the same equation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 66 * 2 = 132. Then 94 + 66 = 160. 160 + 132 = 292, which is way over. Not helpful. Or 66 * something else. Hmm. Another approach: 94 + 66 + 66 = 94 + 132 = 226. Then subtract 2 would be 224. Not 188. No. If I do 94 + (66 * 2) + 66, but that's 94 + 132 + 66 = 292 again. Not useful. What about division? Let's see. Maybe 66 divided by 2 is 33. Then 94 + 66 + 33 = 193. No. Still not 188. Alternatively, 94 minus 66 is 28, then 28 times (66 / 2). Wait, 66/2 is 33. 28 *33 = 924, way too big. No.\n\nHmm. Let's think of the previous solution again. 94 * 2 = 188, and then adding (66 -66) which is zero. So the equation is 94 × 2 + 66 − 66 = 188. That works. Alternatively, written with parentheses: (94 × 2) + (66 − 66) = 188. That seems valid, uses all numbers once. Let me check again: 94, 2, 66, 66. Each is used once, and all are used.

If I multiply 522 by something, but 522 is already a large number. 522 divided by something? 522 divided by 57 is approximately 9.15, which doesn't seem helpful.

Still too low.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 522 - (something) to get a base number. Let's see 638 is the target. 638 is less than 522? No, 638 is higher. So perhaps adding 522 to another number. 522 + 111 = 633. Then I need 5 more. But I have 62 and 57 left. 633 + 62 - 57 = 638. Wait, that works? Let me check. 522 + 111 = 633. Then 633 + 62 = 695.

If I subtract something from it, maybe. 666 minus 34 would be 632. That's still too big. 666 divided by 3 is 222. Then 222 plus 34 would be 256. No. Not 228. Wait 222 plus 6 is 228. But where do I get 6 from? Maybe 40 divided by something. 40 divided by (something) to get 6.666... but not 6. Wait, 40 divided by (maybe 3 and something else). Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, 666 divided by 3 is 222. Then 222 plus (40 - 34) = 222 +6=228. Oh wait! That uses 666 divided by 3, which uses 666 and 3, then 40 minus 34. Let's check: 666 ÷3 =222, 40-34=6, then 222+6=228. Yes! So the equation would be (666 / 3) + (40 -34) =228. Let me verify that: 666 divided by 3 is 222. 40 minus34 is 6. 222 plus6 is 228. Perfect. And all numbers are used once: 666, 3, 40, 34. Yep. That works.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(666 / 3) + (40 - 34) = 228</answer>"}]}

Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should list out the numbers and the target. The target is 86, and the numbers I have are 56, 17, 60, 34. All of them must be used with basic operations: +, -, *, /. Each number can be used only once.\n\nHmm. Let me start by considering the larger numbers first because they might get me closer to the target. The largest numbers here are 60 and 56. Let me see if I can combine those in a way that's helpful. 60 + 56 is 116, which is higher than 86. But maybe I can subtract something from that. But then I have to use 17 and 34 as well. If I subtract 34 from 60, that's 26. Then 26 plus 56 would be 82, which is close but not 86. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe multiply some numbers. Let's see. 60 divided by something? 60 / 17 is about 3.5, which might not be useful. 56 multiplied by 17 is 952, which is way too big. Maybe that's not helpful.\n\nWait, what if I use 60 and 34 together. 60 - 34 is 26. Then 56 - 17 is 39. 26 + 39 is 65. Not 86. Hmm.\n\nAnother approach: Let's think of 86 as a combination of these numbers. 86 is 60 + 26. Do I have 26? Not directly, but maybe 34 can be divided by something to get 17. Wait, 34 divided by 2 is 17, but I already have 17 as a separate number. Maybe that's a path. So if I take 60 + (34 / 2), but 2 isn't one of the numbers. Alternatively, maybe 34 - 17 = 17. Then 60 + 17 = 77. Still not 86.\n\nWait, perhaps using multiplication and addition. Let's try 17 * something. 17 * 5 is 85, which is close. If I can get 5 from the remaining numbers. The numbers left would be 56, 60, 34. Let's see: 60 - 56 = 4. 34 divided by something? 34 divided by 4 is 8.5, which doesn't help. Alternatively, 56 - (60 / 34). But that's messy. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 60 - (56 / 17). Let's compute that: 56 divided by 17 is approximately 3.294. So 60 - 3.294 ≈ 56.7. Then adding 34 would be 90.7, which is over. Not helpful.\n\nWhat if I group 34 and 17 first? 34 - 17 = 17. Then 60 + 56 = 116. 116 - 17 = 99. Not 86. Alternatively, 34 +17=51. 56 +60=116. 116 -51=65. Still not.\n\nWait, maybe use multiplication and subtraction. 56 * 17 is 952. That's way too big. 60 * 34 is 2040. Also too big. Maybe divide. Let's see. 60 divided by 17 is about 3.529. Then 56 - 34 = 22. So 3.529 + 22 ≈ 25.529. Not helpful.\n\nAnother angle: Let's think of 86 as 56 + 30. How to get 30 from 17, 60, 34. 60 - 34 = 26. Then 26 + 17=43. Not 30. Hmm. Wait, 34 - 17=17. 60 -17=43. 56 +43=99. Still not.\n\nAlternatively, 60 - (34 -17)=60-17=43. Then 56 +43=99. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe 34 + 56=90. Then subtract something. 90 - 4=86. How to get 4 from 17 and 60. 60 /17 is about 3.529. Not 4. 17 - (60 - something). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, 34 + (56 - (60 / something)). Let's see: 60 divided by 5 is 12. But 5 isn't a number here. Maybe 60 divided by (something). Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps using 60 and 34. 60 - 34=26. Then 56 +26=82. 82 is close to 86. Then I have 17 left. How to get 4 more. 17 - (something). Maybe 82 + (17 - something). But I already used all numbers except 17. Wait, if I do 56 + (60 -34) =56+26=82. Then add 17? 82+17=99. No. Wait, but I need to use all numbers. So in this case, I have 56, 60, 34 used in 60-34+56. Then 17 is left. So maybe need to combine them in a different way.\n\nAnother idea: Let's try 56 + 34 =90. Then subtract 4 to get 86. How to get 4 from 17 and 60. 60 /17 is approximately 3.529. Not 4. Alternatively, 17 - (60 / something). Maybe 60 divided by 15 is 4. But 15 isn't a number here. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe 17 * (something) to get a value that can be subtracted. If I take 60 + 34 =94. Then subtract 8 to get 86. How to get 8 from 56 and 17. 56 /7=8. But 7 isn't here. Alternatively, 17 - (56 / something). 56 divided by 8 is 7. But 8 isn't present. Maybe 56 divided by (something) using 17. Hmm. 56 divided by 17 is roughly 3.29. Then 17 -3.29=13.7. Not 8.\n\nAlternatively, think of 56 - 60= -4. Then 34 - (-4)=38. Not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps using multiplication and division. For example, 56 * (34 -17) =56*17=952. Then 952 divided by 60 is about 15.86. Not helpful.\n\nAnother approach: Let's think of combining two numbers to get a value, then combining with another. For example, 60 - 56=4. Then 4 *17=68. 68 +34=102. Not 86. Or 60 -56=4, 4 *34=136. Then 136 -17=119. No.\n\nOr 56 -17=39. 60 -34=26. 39 +26=65. Not 86.\n\nHmm. Maybe I need to use division in a way that creates a needed number. For example, 34 divided by 17=2. Then 56 + (60/2)=56 +30=86. Wait, that works! Let's check. 34 divided by 17 is 2. Then 60 divided by that 2 is 30. Then 56 +30=86. So using 34,17 to make 2, then 60 divided by that 2, plus 56. So the equation would be 56 + (60 / (34 /17)) = 86. Let's check the calculation step by step.\n\nFirst, 34 divided by 17 is 2. Then 60 divided by 2 is 30. Then 56 plus 30 is indeed 86. And all numbers are used once: 56, 60, 34,17. Perfect!\n\nYes, that seems to work. Let me verify again:\n\n34 /17 = 2\n\n60 / 2 =30\n\n56 +30=86\n\nAll numbers used: 56, 60,34,17. Exactly once each. So the equation is 56 + (60 / (34 /17)) =86.\n</think>\n\n<answer>56 + 60 / (34 / 17)</answer>"}]}

Let's see how these can combine.\n\nFirst, I notice that 370 is a large number. If I could subtract something from 370 to get closer to 505, but 370 is less than 505, so maybe adding. Wait, 370 + 45 is 415, which is still lower. 370 + 55 is 425. Still not enough. Hmm. Maybe if I multiply some numbers. Let's see, 55 * 9 is 495, but I don't have a 9. Wait, 45 is 9*5. Maybe 55* (something). Let's think.\n\nAlternatively, 55 * 10 is 550, which is 45 more than 505. But how to get 550 minus 45 using the remaining numbers. Wait, but we have 370 and 37. Let's see. 370 + 55 = 425. Then 425 + 45 = 470. Still not enough. Maybe subtract something. 370 - 45 = 325, then 325 + 55 = 380. Not helpful.\n\nWhat if I use multiplication? Let's see. 55 * 37 is a big number. 55*37: 50*37=1850, 5*37=185, total 2035. That's way too big. Maybe division? 370 divided by something. 370 / 37 is 10. So maybe 370 /37 =10. Then 10 * 55 is 550, and 550 -45=505. Wait, that might work! Let me check.\n\nSo the equation would be (370 / 37) * 55 -45 =505. Let's compute step by step. First, 370 divided by 37 is 10. Then 10 multiplied by 55 is 550. 550 minus 45 is indeed 505. And all numbers are used once: 370, 37, 55, 45. Perfect!

Let's start by thinking about the operations. Multiplication is probably key here because 330 is a relatively large number. Let me check what combinations can get close to 330.\n\nFirst, if I multiply 20 and 15, that gives 300. Then I have 11 and 10 left. If I add those two, that's 21. But 300 + 21 is 321, which is 9 short. Not quite there. Alternatively, maybe subtract them? 11 - 10 is 1, so 300 + 1 is 301. Still not enough.\n\nWait, maybe I can use the 20 and 11 first. 20 multiplied by 11 is 220. Then 15 and 10. 15 times 10 is 150. 220 + 150 is 370. That's over. Hmm. Or maybe 220 plus (15 -10) which is 5, so 225. No. Not helpful.\n\nWhat if I do 20 multiplied by 15, which is 300, and then multiply by something else. But I have to use all numbers. So 20*15 is 300, then use 11 and 10. Maybe 11*10 is 110. 300 + 110 is 410. That's too much. Or 300 - 110 is 190. No.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 20* (something). Let's think: 20*(11 + 10) would be 20*21=420. Then subtract 15? 420 -15=405. Still not. Or 20*(15- something). 15-11=4, 20*4=80. Then 80*10=800. That's way over. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe combine two numbers into a two-digit number? Wait, the problem doesn't mention that. Probably not allowed. So each number must be used as is, with operations between them.\n\nAnother approach: 330 divided by 10 is 33. So maybe 33*10=330. How can I get 33 from 20, 11, and 15? Let's see. 20 + 11=31, plus 15=46. No. 15 + 20=35, minus 11=24. Hmm. Not 33. 20 +15=35, 35 - (11)=24. Not helpful. Alternatively, 20 * (15/11) would be about 27.27. Then multiplied by 10 is 272.7. Doesn't work.\n\nWait, maybe 11 * 30 = 330. How to get 30 from 20, 15, and 10. 20 + 10=30. So 11*(20+10) = 11*30=330. Then where does 15 fit in? Wait, we have to use all numbers. So in that case, that approach uses 11,20,10 but leaves out 15. So that's not valid.\n\nHmm. So maybe need to include 15 in the equation. Let's think: 15*22=330. How to get 22 from 20,11,10. 20 + (11 - 10)=21. Not 22. 20 + 10 -11=19. No. 11*2=22, but how to get 2 from 20 and 10. 20/10=2. So maybe 15*(11*(20/10)). Let's compute that: 20/10=2, 11*2=22, 15*22=330. That uses all numbers: 20,10,11,15. Let me check: (15 * (11 * (20 / 10))) = 15*(11*2)=15*22=330. Yes! But the operations have to be applied with the numbers. So the equation would be 15 * 11 * (20 / 10). Let me verify if all numbers are used once: 15, 11, 20, 10. Yes. And the operations are multiplication and division. So that works. So the equation is 15 * 11 * (20 / 10) = 330. Let me check the order of operations. Division first: 20/10=2. Then 11*2=22.

Let's check the bigger numbers. 361 is the largest here. If I subtract something from 361, can I get partway there? Or maybe multiply some numbers. Let me think.\n\nWait, 361 is close to 360, which is 12*30 or 60*6, but not sure. Let's try adding numbers. If I add 53 and 48, that's 101. Then 32 added to that is 133. So 361 + 133 is 494, which is too big. But maybe subtracting instead. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe multiply some numbers. Let's see, 48 multiplied by 53 would be way too big (48*53=2544). That's way over. How about 53*32? That's 1696. Still too big. 48*32=1536. Also too big. So multiplying the bigger numbers might not be helpful. Maybe divide?\n\nWhat if I divide 361 by something?

Let's see, 430 divided by 53 is approximately 8.113. So if I can get 8.113 using the other numbers, but that might not be straightforward.\n\nWait, 48 and 32. 48 - 32 = 16. So maybe 53 * 16 = 848, but that's way over. Then subtract 361? 848 - 361 = 487. Not 430. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, 53 * (48 - 32) = 53*16=848. Then subtract 361? 848-361=487. Still not.

If I subtract something from 90, maybe. 90 - 24 is 66, which is too low. 90 - 15 is 75. That's closer. Then I have 6 left. 75 plus 6 is 81, which is over. 75 minus 6 is 69. Not helpful.

But then we have two 15s, which we can't do. So maybe that's not useful.\n\nWhat about multiplication? 24 times 15 is 360. That's way too big. 24 times 6 is 144. If I subtract that from 90, 90 - 144 is negative. Not helpful. Maybe 15 times 6 is 90, but again, we already have 90. So that's redundant.\n\nWait, maybe combining 24 and 15 first. 24 + 15 is 39. Then 90 - 39 is 51. Then 51 + 6 is 57. Nope. Or 24 - 15 = 9. Then 9 * 6 = 54. 90 - 54 = 36. Not 79.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe use division to create fractions. For example, 90 divided by something. Let's try 90/(15) = 6. Then we have 24, 6, and 6 left. But can't use 6 twice. So no. Or 24 divided by 6 is 4. Then 4 + 15 = 19. 19 * something? 19*4=76, but we have 90 left. 90 - 76=14.

Then 24 divided by 6 is 4. 75 +4=79. Oh! Wait, that uses all the numbers: 90 -15 + (24/6). Let me check: 24 divided by 6 is 4. 90 minus 15 is 75. 75 plus 4 is 79. Yes! And all numbers are used once: 90,15,24,6. So the equation would be 90 -15 +24/6=79. Let me verify the order of operations. Division comes before addition and subtraction. So yes, that works.

Let me check the numbers I have. The largest number is 83, then 26, 18, and 13. Maybe if I multiply 83 by something to get close to 747. Let me calculate 83 times 9 is 747. Wait, exactly! 83*9=747. So if I can somehow get 9 from the other numbers (26, 13, 18), that would work. Let's see. The remaining numbers are 26, 13, and 18. How can I combine them to get 9? Let's try different combinations.\n\nFirst, 26 minus 18 is 8. Then 13 minus 8 would be 5. Not helpful. Alternatively, 18 minus 13 is 5, then 26 minus 5 is 21. No. Maybe division? 18 divided by something. 26 divided by 13 is 2. Then 18 minus 2 is 16. Not 9. Wait, maybe 26 minus 13 is 13. Then 18 minus 13 is 5. Still not 9. Hmm.\n\nWait, 26, 13, and 18. Let's see, maybe 18 minus (26 divided by 13). Let's compute that: 26 divided by 13 is 2. Then 18 minus 2 is 16. No. Alternatively, (18 - 13) is 5, then 26 - 5 is 21. Not 9. What if we do 26 + 18 = 44, then 44 divided by 13 is about 3.38. Not helpful. Maybe subtract instead. 26 - (18 -13) = 26 -5=21. Still no.\n\nWait, maybe using multiplication. 13 times something. Let's think. If I need to get 9, maybe 18 - (26 / 13). Wait, 26 divided by 13 is 2. Then 18 minus 2 is 16. No. What if I do (26 - 18) +13? That's 8 +13=21. Not 9. Hmm. What if I subtract them: (26 - 13) which is 13, then 18 -13=5. Still not. Maybe (18 +13) is 31, then 31 -26=5. No.\n\nWait, maybe using division and multiplication together. Let's see. 26 divided by 13 is 2. Then 18 divided by 2 is 9. Oh! Wait, that could work. So 18 divided by (26 divided by 13) equals 9. Because 26 divided by 13 is 2, and 18 divided by 2 is 9. So then if I multiply 83 by that 9, I get 747. Let me check:\n\n83 * (18 / (26 / 13)) = 83 * (18 / 2) = 83 *9=747. Yes! That works. Let me verify all numbers are used once: 83, 18, 26, 13. Yes, all used once. And the operations are division and multiplication. So the equation is 83 × (18 ÷ (26 ÷ 13)) =747. Let me write that in the required format with parentheses to ensure order of operations. So the equation would be 83 * (18 / (26 / 13)) = 747. Let me check again: 26 divided by13 is 2, then 18 divided by 2 is9, 83*9=747. Perfect.\n</think>\n\n<answer>83 * (18 / (26 / 13))</answer>"}]}

Each number has to be used exactly once, and I can only use basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The result should be 202. Hmm, this seems a bit tricky. Let me start by breaking down the problem.\n\nFirst, I should note that 808 is a large number, so maybe I can use it as a starting point. If I subtract something from 808, maybe I can reach 202. Let's test that idea. 808 minus what equals 202? Let's calculate: 808 - 202 = 606. So I need to create 606 using 1, 96, and 24. But wait, that might not be possible. Let's check: 96 and 24. If I multiply 96 by 24, that's 2304, which is way too big. If I subtract them: 96 - 24 = 72. Then 72 * 1 = 72. Still not enough. Hmm, maybe 96 + 24 = 120, then 120 + 1 = 121. 808 - 121 = 687, which isn't 202. Maybe that approach isn't right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use division. Let's see. 808 divided by something equals 202. 808 ÷ 4 = 202. So I need to make 4 using 1, 96, and 24. Let's try. 24 divided by (96 / something with 1). Hmm, 24 divided by 6 is 4. So maybe 96 divided by something equals 6. 96 ÷ 16 = 6. But how do I get 16 from 1? Maybe not. Wait, 24 / (96 / (1)) = 24 /96 = 0.25. That's not helpful. Alternatively, 96 - (24 * something). If I do 24 * 4 = 96, but that uses 24 and 96. Then 96 - 24*4 would be zero. Not helpful. Wait, perhaps (96 / 24) + 1. That's (4) +1 =5. Then 808 ÷5 is 161.6, which is not 202. Close but not there.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe combine 96 and 24 first. Let's see, 96 divided by 24 is 4. Then 4 * 1 =4. Then 808 -4 = 804. Not helpful. Or 96 +24 =120. 120 -1=119. 808 -119=689. Not 202.\n\nWait, maybe multiplication instead. If I take 24 and multiply it by something to get close to 202. 24*8=192, 24*8.5=204. But I don't have 8.5. But maybe 808 divided by something gives me 202. Wait, 808 /4=202. So I need to make 4 with the remaining numbers. Let's see, 96,24,1. If I do 96 divided by 24 =4. Then 4 -1=3. Not 4. Alternatively, 24 - (96/ something). Hmm, 96 divided by 1 is 96. 24 -96= -72. No. How about 96/(24*1)=96/24=4. There we go! So 96 divided by (24 times 1) equals 4. Then 808 divided by 4 is 202. So putting it all together: 808 ÷ (96 ÷ (24 × 1)) = 202. Let me check that. First, calculate the inner parentheses: 24 ×1=24. Then 96 ÷24=4. Then 808 ÷4=202. Yes, that works! So the equation is 808 / (96 / (24 * 1)) = 202. But I need to use all the numbers: 808,1,96,24. In this case, each is used once. The operations are multiplication, division, and division again. So that seems to fit. Let me verify again. 24 multiplied by 1 is 24. Then 96 divided by that 24 is 4. Then 808 divided by 4 is 202. Perfect. So the equation is 808 / (96 / (24 * 1)) = 202. I need to present this using all the numbers once with operations. Let me check if the parentheses are correctly placed. Yes, because division is left-associative, but in this case, the parentheses ensure that 24*1 is computed first, then 96 divided by that result, then 808 divided by the result. So this works.\n</think>\n\n<answer>808 / (96 / (24 * 1)) = 202</answer>"}]}

I need to use all the numbers 13, 35, 59, and 71 exactly once each with basic arithmetic operations to make 152. Hmm. Let's start by thinking about possible combinations.\n\nFirst, maybe adding some of the larger numbers together. Let's check the sum of 35 and 59: 35 + 59 = 94. Then add 71: 94 + 71 = 165. That's more than 152. If I subtract 13 from that, 165 - 13 = 152. Wait, wait! Let me check again. 35 + 59 is 94, plus 71 is 165. Then 165 minus 13 equals 152. So that would be 35 + 59 + 71 - 13. But let me verify: 35+59 is 94, plus 71 is 165, minus 13 is indeed 152. But does that use all the numbers once? Yes: 35, 59, 71, and 13. All used once. So that's a possible equation. Let me write that down: 35 + 59 + 71 - 13 = 152. But wait, maybe parentheses are needed somewhere? Let me check the order of operations. Since addition and subtraction are left to right, but in this case, all operations are addition and subtraction, so the order would work as written. So (35 + 59) + 71 - 13 = 152. Alternatively, it's the same result without parentheses. So the equation would be 35 + 59 + 71 - 13 = 152. Let me confirm the math again. 35 +59 is 94. 94 +71 is 165. 165 -13 is 152. Yep, that works. \n\nWait, but maybe there's another way? Let me check if there's another combination. For example, using multiplication. Let's see. If I multiply 13 by something. 13 * 11 is 143, which is close to 152. But 11 would need to be made from the remaining numbers. The other numbers are 35,59,71. Let's see 35+59=94. 94-71=23. Hmm, not helpful. Alternatively, 35 - (71 -59) = 35 -12=23. 13*23=299, which is way over. Maybe subtract something else. How about 71 - (59 -35)=71-24=47. 13*47=611, which is way too big. \n\nAlternatively, maybe 35* something. 35*4=140. 152-140=12. How can I get 12 from 13,59,71? 71-59=12, then subtract 13? 12-13= -1. Not helpful. Maybe 59 - (71 -13)=59 -58=1. 35*1=35. Not helpful. \n\nAnother approach: maybe division. Let's see. 71 divided by something. 71/13 is about 5.46. Then 35+59=94. 94 +5.46 is about 99.46. Doesn't help. Alternatively, 59/13 is about 4.538. Adding that to 35 is 39.538, then +71=110.538. Not useful. \n\nWhat if I subtract two numbers and multiply? For example, (71 - 59) =12. Then 12 *13=156. 35 is left. 156 -35=121. Not 152. Or 12 +35=47. 47* something? 47*3=141. But then 141 +13=154. Close but not 152. \n\nWait, another idea: maybe 35* (something). Let's see. 35*4=140. 140 + 12=152. Where can 12 come from? 71 -59=12. Then 35*4 + (71-59) =140+12=152. But how to get 4 from 13? 13 can't be 4. Unless I use 13 as part of division. For example, 13 divided by something. Wait, but we have to use all numbers once. So in this case, 35*(13 - (71/59))? Let's compute: 71/59 is approximately 1.203. 13 -1.203 is about 11.797. 35*11.797≈413. Not close. \n\nAlternatively, maybe subtract and add. Let's consider 71 +59=130. Then 130 +35=165. 165 -13=152. Wait, that's the same as the first equation. Because 71+59=130, plus 35 is 165, minus 13 is 152. So the equation is 71 +59 +35 -13=152. Which is the same as before, just the order of addition changed. So that's the same solution. \n\nSo maybe that's the only possible way. Let me check if there's another combination. What if I multiply two numbers and then add or subtract others. For example, 13*35=455. Then subtract something. 455 -59=396, minus71=325. Not helpful. 13*59=767. 767 -35=732. Minus71=661. Not useful. 35*59=2065. That's way too big. 35*71=2485. Also too big. So multiplication of large numbers isn't helpful here. \n\nDivision: Let's see. 71 divided by 35 is roughly 2.028. Then 59 -13=46. 46 *2.028≈93.3. Not 152. Or 59/(71-35)=59/36≈1.638. Then 13*1.638≈21.3. 35+21.3=56.3. Not close. \n\nAnother angle: Let's see, 152 is 160-8. Maybe that's possible. How to get 160? 71+59=130, then 35-13=22. 130+22=152. Wait, that's the same as before. Because 71+59+ (35-13)=71+59+22=152. So that's another way to write it. So 71 +59 + (35 -13) =152. Which is the same as the original equation but grouped differently. So the equation can be written as (71 +59) + (35 -13) =152. But again, using all numbers once. So yes, that's another valid representation. \n\nAre there other possibilities? Let me check. Maybe 59 -13=46. Then 71+35=106. 106 +46=152. Wait, that's 71+35 + (59-13)=106 +46=152. So that's 71 +35 +59 -13=152. Which is the same as the previous ones. Just reordered. So all these are the same equation, just the order of addition changes. \n\nSo the only solution is combining three numbers as additions and subtracting the fourth. Therefore, the equation is 35 +59 +71 -13 =152. Or any equivalent arrangement. So the answer would be (35 +59 +71) -13 or similar. But since the order doesn't matter, maybe just write it without parentheses. Let me confirm once again. \n\n35 +59=94. 94 +71=165. 165 -13=152. Correct. All numbers used once. So the equation is 35 +59 +71 -13=152. \n\nI think that's the solution. Let me check if there's any other way. For example, with multiplication and division. Let's say, 13 multiplied by something. Suppose 13*11=143. Then 143 +9=152. But 9 would have to come from 35,59,71. Let's see: 35 - (59-71)=35 -(-12)=47. Not helpful. 71-59=12, then 12 + something. 12 + (35-something). 12 +35=47, 47 + something. Not getting 9. Alternatively, 59 - (71 -35)=59-36=23. 13*23=299. 299- something=152? 299-147=152. But 147 is not obtainable from remaining numbers. \n\nAlternatively, maybe (35/13) * something. 35/13≈2.692. Then 2.692* something. Let's see, 2.692*56≈150. But 56 from 59,71: 59-3=56. But 3 is not available. Alternatively, 71-15=56. 15 is not available. \n\nThis approach seems not working. How about 59 - (71 / something). 71 divided by 13 is about 5.46. 59-5.46≈53.54. Then 35 +53.54≈88.54. Not 152. \n\nAnother idea: 35* (something) - something. Let's see, 35*4=140. 140 +12=152. But how to get 12? 71-59=12, then subtract 13? 12-13=-1. So 35*4 + (71-59) -13=140 +12 -13=139. Not 152. Alternatively, 35*5=175. 175 -23=152. 23 from 59- (71-13)=59-58=1. Not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, 35*3=105. 105 +47=152. 47 from 59-12=47. But 12 is 71-59=12. So 59 - (71-59)=59-12=47. Then 35*3 +47=105 +47=152. But where does the 3 come from? We need to use 13. Hmm. 13 is left, but 3 is not part of the numbers. Unless I do something like 13 - (something). For example, 13 - (35/ something). 35/ something=10. Then 13-10=3. But 35 divided by 3.5 is 10, but 3.5 isn't a number we have. \n\nThis seems getting too complicated. Maybe the initial solution is the only one possible. So the equation is 35 +59 +71 -13 =152. Therefore, the answer would be written as (35 + 59 + 71) - 13 or just 35 + 59 + 71 -13. Since order of operations doesn't affect here, parentheses aren't necessary. So the answer is 35 + 59 + 71 - 13.\n</think>\n\n<answer>35 + 59 + 71 - 13 = 152</answer>"}]}

The two 65s might be useful here. If I multiply 60 and 7, that's 420. Oh wait, but I have to use all four numbers. So that approach would use only two numbers. So that's not going to work. \n\nWait, maybe I can use the two 65s somehow. Let's see. If I subtract them: 65 - 65 is 0, but that might not help. Adding them gives 130. Then maybe 130 times something? Let's see. 130 multiplied by 3.23 (which is 420/130) but I don't have a 3.23. Alternatively, perhaps combine 60 and 7 first. Like 60 + 7 is 67, but not sure how that helps. \n\nAlternatively, 65 divided by 65 is 1. Then maybe 1 times 60 times 7 would be 420. But wait, that would use all numbers. Let me check: (65 / 65) * 60 * 7. Yes, that works. Let me compute that. 65 divided by 65 is 1. Then 1 * 60 is 60. 60 *7 is 420. So that uses all numbers once each. But wait, is division allowed? The problem says basic arithmetic operations are allowed. So yes, division is okay. So that equation would be (65 / 65) * 60 * 7. Let me verify:\n\n65 divided by 65 is 1. Then 1 multiplied by 60 is 60, then 60 multiplied by 7 is 420. Perfect! That uses all numbers once each. Let me check if there are other ways, but this seems to work. Alternatively, maybe using subtraction or addition somewhere else. But this seems straightforward. Let me make sure there's no mistake here. Each number is used once: 65, 65, 60, 7. Yes. So the equation is (65 / 65) * 60 * 7 = 420. Alternatively, the parentheses could be different, but the key part is the division of the two 65s to get 1. That's a common technique in these puzzles.

How can I combine 32 with 14 and 61 to get 79? Maybe 32 + something. 32 + 14 = 46. Then 46 + 61 = 107, which is too much. Alternatively, 93 - 61 is 32, then 61 -14 =47. 32 +47=79.

If I can subtract something from 671 to get close to 198, that might work. Let me try 671 minus something. Let's see, 671 minus 66 is 605, which is still way too big. 671 minus 61 is 610. Still too big. How about 671 divided by something? 671 divided by 3 is around 223, which is higher than 198. If I divide 671 by 3.3, but I don't have 3.3, but maybe using 33.

Let's see, 66 * 3 =198. So if I can get 3 from the other numbers. The remaining numbers are 61, 671, 33. Hmm. 33 divided by 11 is 3, but 11 isn't there. Alternatively, 671 divided by 61 is 11. Because 61 * 11 = 671. Oh, that's interesting! So 671 divided by 61 equals 11. Then 33 divided by 11 is 3. So putting that together: 66 * (33 / (671 / 61)) = 66 * (33 / 11) = 66 * 3 = 198. Let me check that.\n\nBreaking it down step by step: 671 divided by 61 is 11. Then 33 divided by 11 is 3. Then 66 multiplied by 3 is 198. Yes! That works. So the equation would be 66 * (33 / (671 / 61)). Let me check if all numbers are used once: 66, 33, 671, 61. Yep, all four numbers are used. So that's the equation.\n</think>\n\n<answer>66 * (33 / (671 / 61)) = 198</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using all the numbers 77, 66, 84, and 218 exactly once, with basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) to get 145. Hmm. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, maybe I should look at the target number, 145, and see if I can find numbers close to it that might be achievable with these numbers. Let's list out the numbers: 77, 66, 84, 218. All of them are even except 77 and 218. Wait, 218 is even (218 ÷ 2 = 109), 77 is odd. 66 and 84 are also even. So maybe combining the odd number with others might help.\n\nLet me think about possible combinations. Since 218 is the largest number, maybe subtracting something from it could get close to 145. Let's try 218 minus something. Let's see, 218 - 73 = 145. So if I can make 73 from the other numbers (77, 66, 84), that could work. But I need to use all numbers. Wait, the other numbers are 77, 66, 84. How can I make 73 from those? Let's see.\n\nLooking at 77 and 84. 84 - 77 = 7. Then 66 + 7 would be 73. But how to combine that. So 84 - 77 = 7, then 66 + 7 = 73. So then 218 - (66 + (84 -77)) = 218 - (66 +7) = 218 -73 = 145. Let me check that. So that uses 218, 66, 84, 77. All numbers are used once. The operations are subtraction, addition, and another subtraction. That should work. Let's write that as an equation: 218 - 66 - (84 -77) = 145. Wait, let's compute that. First, 84 -77 is 7. Then 218 -66 is 152. Then 152 -7 is 145. Yes, that works. So the equation would be 218 - 66 - (84 - 77) = 145. Let me check if all numbers are used once: 218, 66, 84, 77. Yes, all four numbers are used. And the operations are subtraction and parentheses. That's allowed.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: Maybe using division or multiplication. But since the first approach worked without needing those, maybe that's the simplest way. Let me confirm if there's another possible equation. For example, could we use 77 + 66 = 143, which is close to 145. Then we need 2 more. But we have 84 and 218 left. How to get 2 from 84 and 218. Maybe 218 -84 is 134. Not helpful. Or 84 / something? 84 divided by 42 is 2, but we don't have 42. Alternatively, 84 - (218 / something). Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, 218 - (84 * something). But 84*2 is 168, 218 -168=50. Not helpful. So maybe that approach isn't working.\n\nAnother idea: 77 * 2 = 154. But 154 is higher than 145. Then subtract 9: 154 -9=145. But how to get 9 from the remaining numbers. We have 66, 84, 218. 84 -66=18. Then 18/2=9. But we don't have a 2 unless we divide 84 by something else. Hmm, this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using division with 218. For example, 218 divided by something. 218 / 2 is 109, which could be part of an equation. But how to get 109 from other numbers? Let's see. 77 + 66 = 143. Then 143 - 84 = 59. Not 109. Alternatively, 84 + 66 = 150. 150 -77 =73. Then 218 / 73 is 3 (approx 2.98). Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe combining 84 and 77. Let's see, 84 +77=161. Then 161 - something=145. 161-16=145. How to get 16 from 66 and 218. 66 - (218 / something). 218 divided by 13.625 is 16. But that's not an integer. Alternatively, 218 -66=152. 152/9.5=16. Hmm, not helpful. So maybe that's a dead end.\n\nLet me go back to the first solution I had. 218 -66 - (84 -77) = 145. That works, uses all numbers once. Let me check the calculation again. 84 minus 77 is 7. Then 66 plus 7 is 73. Then 218 minus 73 is 145. Wait, but in the equation as written, 218 -66 - (84 -77) is equivalent to (218 -66) - (84 -77) = 152 -7=145. So yes. That's correct. So the equation is 218 - 66 - (84 -77) = 145. So that's valid. All numbers are used once, and operations are subtraction and parentheses. Seems good. Let me see if there's any other possible solution.\n\nAnother idea: 218 - (77 + 66 + 84) = 218 - 227 = -9. Not helpful. Alternatively, 218 - (77 +66) = 218 -143=75. Then 84 -75=9. Still not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 77 + 66 =143, 84 - something=2. Then 143 +2=145. So how to get 2 from 218. 218 divided by 109=2, but 109 is not in the numbers. Alternatively, 218 -216=2. But 216 is 6^3, but not in the numbers. Maybe 84 - (218 / something). 218 divided by 109 is 2, but again 109 isn't here. Maybe 218 divided by 77 is about 2.83. Hmm, not 2. So maybe that's not possible.\n\nAnother approach: Let's try using multiplication. For example, 84 * 2 =168. Then 168 -23=145. How to get 23 from 77, 66, 218. Not obvious. Alternatively, 77 * 66 is a big number, 5082. Divided by something. That seems too big. 218 divided by 84 is about 2.6. Maybe not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 77 - (218 / something). Let's see, 218 divided by 2 is 109, but 77-109= -32. Not helpful. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe 84 divided by something. 84 divided by 66 is about 1.27. Not helpful. 84 divided by 77 is about 1.09. Still not helpful. 218 divided by 66 is about 3.3. So maybe 218 divided by 66 is approx 3.3, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, 77 + 66 =143, then 84 divided by something. 84 divided by 218 is 0.385. So 143 + 0.385 = 143.385. Not 145. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, 218 - 77 =141. Then 141 +4=145. How to get 4 from 66 and 84. 84 divided by 21=4, but 21 isn't here. 66 divided by 16.5=4, but 16.5 isn't a number here. 84 -66=18. Then 18 divided by something. 18/4.5=4. Not helpful.\n\nHmm. So maybe the first solution is the correct one. Let's check again:\n\n218 -66 =152\n\n84 -77=7\n\n152 -7=145\n\nYes, so the equation is 218 - 66 - (84 - 77) =145.\n\nAnother way to write it could be 218 - (66 +84 -77). Let's compute that: 66 +84=150; 150 -77=73; 218 -73=145. So that's another way to parenthesize it. Either way, the equation uses all numbers once.\n\nSo the answer is 218 - 66 - (84 -77) =145.\n</think>\n\n<answer>218 - 66 - (84 - 77) = 145</answer>"}]}

I need to use all the numbers 49, 44, 39, and 386 exactly once each with basic operations to make 772. Hmm. Let me start by thinking about the target number 772. Maybe I can find a way to get close to that by combining some of these numbers.\n\nFirst, 386 is a big number. If I can somehow multiply or add it with another number to get close to 772. Let's try multiplying. 386 times 2 is 772 exactly. Oh, wait! So if I can get 386 multiplied by 2, but how can I get 2 using the other numbers: 49, 44, and 39. Let me check that.\n\nThe remaining numbers are 49, 44, and 39. I need to use them to make 2. Let's see. Let's try subtracting. For example, 49 - 44 is 5. Then 5 - 39 would be negative. Not helpful. Maybe 44 - 39 is 5. Then 49 - 5 would be 44. Still not 2. Alternatively, perhaps division. Like (49 - 44) divided by something. 49 - 44 is 5. If I divide that by, say, 39 divided by something else. Wait, but I have to use all three numbers. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, 44 - (49 - 39). Let's compute that: 49-39 is 10, so 44 -10 is 34. Not 2. Hmm. Maybe adding and then dividing. For example, (44 + 39) divided by something. 44+39=83. If I divide 83 by 49, that's about 1.69, which is not 2. Close, but not quite.\n\nWait, maybe I can use 49 and 44 to make a 2. Let's see: 44 divided by (49 - something). If I have 49 - 39, that's 10. Then 44 / 10 is 4.4. Not 2. Alternatively, 49 / (something). If I do 49 divided by (44 - 39), that's 49 divided by 5, which is 9.8. Also not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 39 divided by something. Like 39/(49-44) is 39/5=7.8. Still not. Hmm.\n\nWait, what if I combine two operations. For example, (49 - 44) + (39 - something). But I need to use all three numbers. Let's see. If I take 49, 44, and 39, maybe (49 + 39) - 44. That would be 88 -44=44. Not 2. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 44 - (49 + 39). That's 44 -88= -44. No. How about (44 + 39)/49. 83/49≈1.69. Still not 2. Close, but not exact.\n\nWait, maybe there's a different approach. Instead of trying to make 2, maybe there's another way to reach 772. Let's see. 772 divided by 386 is 2. So if I can get 386 multiplied by 2, as before. But perhaps there's another factor pair. Let's see. 772 is 700 + 72. Maybe 700 + 72, but I need to use the numbers given. Alternatively, 49*16 is 784, which is too big. 44*17=748. Hmm. Not helpful.\n\nWait, let me think of other combinations. Maybe subtract some numbers. 386 + 44 = 430. 49*39 is 1911. That's way too big. 49*16=784, which is 12 more than 772. But 784 -12 is 772. But how to get 12 from the remaining numbers? But I've already used 49 and 386 here. Wait, maybe not. Let's try another approach.\n\nAlternatively, 44*39=1716. If I divide that by something. 1716 divided by 49 is about 35.02. Not helpful. 1716 divided by 386 is around 4.44. No. Hmm.\n\nWhat if I take 386 and add some other numbers. 386 + 49 =435. Then 435 +44=479. 479 +39=518. Not close. If I subtract instead: 386 +49=435, 435-44=391, 391-39=352. No.\n\nAlternatively, 386* (something). Let's see, 386*2=772. So maybe 386*( (49 -44) + (39/ something)). Wait, but I have to use all numbers. Let's see. If I take (49 -44)=5. Then maybe 39 divided by something. If I do 39/ (something) to get 2 -5= -3? That seems messy.\n\nWait, perhaps 386 multiplied by ( (49 - 44) + (39 / 39) ). But 39/39 is 1. So 5 +1=6. 386*6=2316. Way too big. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 386*( (44 -39) ) which is 386*5=1930. Then subtract 49, which is 1930-49=1881. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe combining 386 with 44. 386 +44=430. Then 430* something. 430*1.8=774. Close. But 1.8 would need to come from 49 and 39. Let's see. 49-39=10. 10/ something. 10/5.555=1.8. But how?\n\nAlternatively, 386 + (44*39). Let's compute 44*39=1716. 386+1716=2102. Way too big.\n\nHmm. Let's try another angle. What if we subtract two numbers to get 386, then multiply by something. For example, 49*44=2156. 2156 - 386=1770. Not helpful. 1770 -39=1731. No.\n\nWait, perhaps 44* (something). 44*17.5=770, which is close to 772. 17.5 is 35/2. Can I get 35 from 49, 39, and 386? 49 - (386/ something). Wait, that's getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, 49*16=784. 784-12=772. How to get 12? 44 - 39=5. Then 49- (44-39)=49-5=44. Not 12. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe (49 + 39) =88. 88* something. 88*8.8=774.4. Not quite. 88*8.727=772. Maybe, but how to get 8.727 from 44 and 386. Not sure.\n\nWait another idea: 386*2=772. So if I can create 2 using 49,44,39. Let's try again. How?\n\nLet's think: 49 - 44 =5. Then 5 - (39 / something). If I do 39 divided by 13 =3, but how to get 13. Not helpful. Alternatively, (44 +39) / something. 44+39=83. 83 divided by 49 is about 1.69. Close to 1.7. Not 2. If I can get 83/ (something) equals 2. 83/2=41.5. But I don't have 41.5. Wait, 49 - (44 -39) =49 -5=44. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, (49 - 39) =10. Then 10/(44 - something). Wait, 44 - (something) needs to be 5 to get 10/5=2. So if I can make 44 - x =5, then x=39. Yes! So 44 -39=5. Then 49 -39=10. Wait, no. Wait, if we have (49 - (44 -39))? Let's compute that. 44-39=5, then 49-5=44. Not helpful. But if we do (49 - 44) + (39 /39)=5+1=6. 386*6=2316. No.\n\nWait, here's an idea. Let's take 49 and 44. Let's subtract them: 49-44=5. Then take 39 and divide by that 5. 39/5=7.8. Then 7.8*386=7.8*386. Let me compute that: 7*386=2702, 0.8*386=308.8. So total 2702+308.8=3010.8. Not 772. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 44 divided by (49 -39). 49-39=10. 44/10=4.4. Then 4.4*386=1700.4. Still not.\n\nHmm. Maybe I need to use subtraction. Let's see: 386*2=772. So how to get 2 from 49,44,39. Let's think: 44 / (49 -39) =44/10=4.4. Not 2. What if we do (49 +39)/44. 88/44=2. Oh! Wait, that's 49 +39=88, then 88 divided by 44=2. Yes! Then multiply that by 386. So the equation would be 386 * ((49 +39)/44). Let's check that.\n\nFirst, compute 49+39=88. Then 88 divided by 44=2. Then 386*2=772. Exactly! That uses all numbers: 386, 49, 39, and 44. Each once. Perfect!\n\nSo the equation is 386 * ((49 + 39) / 44) =772.\n</think>\n\n<answer>386 * ((49 + 39) / 44)</answer>"}]}

Still not close to 895. Alternatively, 81+25=106. Then 106*37=3922, way too big.\n\nWait, maybe 51*37=1887. If I subtract something from that... 1887 - 81=1806, then 1806 -25=1781. Not helpful. Alternatively, 51*17 is 867, but 17 isn't one of the numbers. Hmm.\n\nLet me try different combinations. 25 multiplied by something. 25*37=925. Then 925 + something. Let's see, 925 + 81 = 1006.

Let me check that: 25*37=925. 925-81=844. 844+51=895. Yes! But I need to use all numbers once and each operation is allowed. So the equation would be (25 * 37) - 81 + 51.

I need to create an equation using the numbers 38, 98, 362, and 42, each exactly once, and the result should be 456. The operations allowed are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Hmm, let's start by thinking about the target number, 456. What combinations of these numbers could get me close to that?\n\nFirst, let's look at the largest number here, which is 362. If I subtract some combination of the other numbers from 362, maybe that could work. Let's try that. Let's see: 362 - 38 = 324. Then, 324 - 98 = 226. That's way too low. If I subtract 42 instead, 324 - 42 = 282. Still not close. Alternatively, maybe adding some numbers to 362. 362 + 98 = 460. Hmm, 460 is just 4 more than 456. Then maybe subtract 4. But I don't have a 4; I have 42 and 38. Wait, 460 - (42 - 38) = 460 - 4 = 456. Oh, that's interesting. Let me check that. So 362 + 98 = 460. Then subtract (42 - 38) which is 4. So 460 - 4 = 456. But wait, I have to use all numbers exactly once. Let me see: 362 and 98 are used in the addition, then 42 and 38 are used in the subtraction part. Yes, that uses all four numbers once each. So the equation would be 362 + 98 - (42 - 38) = 456. Let me verify that: 42 - 38 is 4, then 362 +98 is 460, minus 4 is 456. Yep, that works. Let me check if there's another way, but this seems like a valid solution. Let me see if there's another combination just to be sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using multiplication. For example, 42 * 10.9 is about 456, but 10.9 isn't directly available. Let's see, 362 divided by something. 362 / 0.8 is 452.5, close but not exact. Another approach: 98 * 4.6 is about 450.8. Not helpful. Maybe 38 * 12 = 456. But 12 isn't directly available. How could I get 12 from the remaining numbers? Let's see: 98, 362, 42. Wait, 362 - 42 = 320. 320 divided by something to get 12? 320 / 26.666... Not helpful. Alternatively, 42 - 38 = 4, but then 4 * 98 = 392. 362 + 392 = 754, which is way over. Hmm, not helpful. Alternatively, 98 - 38 = 60. Then 60 * 7.6 = 456. But 7.6 would need to come from 362 and 42. 362 / 42 is approximately 8.619, which isn't 7.6. So that doesn't work.\n\nAnother idea: 42 * 11 = 462. Close to 456. Then subtract 6. But how? 42 * 11 - 6 = 456. But getting 11 and 6 from 362, 98, 38. Not sure. Alternatively, 42 * (something) - (something else). Let's see. Maybe 42 * (362 / 98) - 38. Let me calculate that: 362 /98 is approximately 3.694. 42 * 3.694 ≈ 155.148. Minus 38 is 117.148. Not close. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 362 - 98 = 264. Then 264 + 42 + 38 = 344. No, not enough. 362 + 42 = 404. 404 + 98 = 502. 502 - 38 = 464. Still off by 8. Not helpful.\n\nWait, going back to the first solution. 362 +98 is 460. Then subtract (42 -38)=4. So 460-4=456. That seems to work. Let me make sure all numbers are used once: 362, 98, 42, 38. Yes. So the equation is (362 + 98) - (42 - 38) = 456. Let me compute each step again to confirm:\n\nFirst, 42 -38 =4.\n\nThen, 362 +98 =460.\n\n460 -4 =456. Yep, that's correct. So the equation would be 362 + 98 - (42 - 38) = 456.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. Let me check if there's another possible way, but this seems straightforward and uses all numbers once. Another check: 362 +98 is 460. Then 42-38=4. 460-4=456. Perfect. All numbers are used once. That should be the solution.\n</think>\n\n<answer>362 + 98 - (42 - 38) = 456</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using the numbers 24, 72, 41, and 81 exactly once each, with basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) to get 202. Hmm, how to approach this?\n\nFirst, maybe I should check what the total sum of these numbers is. Let's add them up: 24 + 72 is 96, plus 41 is 137, plus 81 is 218. So the total sum is 218. But I need 202, which is 16 less than 218. So maybe if I can subtract 16 somewhere instead of adding. But how to distribute that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe multiplication or division can help. Let's think about combinations. For example, 81 is a larger number; maybe using it in multiplication or division. Let's try 81 divided by something. If I divide 81 by, say, 24, that's 3.375, which might not help much. Alternatively, 72 divided by 24 is 3, then 3 times 81 would be 243, but then subtract 41? 243 - 41 is 202. Wait, that could work! Let me check:\n\n72 divided by 24 is 3. Then 3 multiplied by 81 is 243. Then subtract 41: 243 - 41 = 202. But wait, that uses 72, 24, 81, and 41. Exactly all numbers once. Let me write that as an equation: (72 / 24) * 81 - 41. Let me compute step by step:\n\n72 divided by 24 is 3. 3 times 81 is 243. 243 minus 41 is indeed 202. That works! So the equation would be (72 / 24) * 81 - 41 = 202. Let me make sure all numbers are used once: 72, 24, 81, 41. Yes, all four numbers are used once each.

Each number must be used exactly once, and the result should be 482. The operations allowed are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Hmm, how do I start?\n\nFirst, maybe I should look at the target number, 482. Let's see how close each of these numbers can get to 482. 736 is larger than 482, so maybe I can subtract something from it. 736 minus something... Let's see. If I take 736 - (some combination of the other numbers), maybe that could work.\n\nThe other numbers are 37, 369, and 32. Let's see. If I subtract 369 from 736, that would give 736 - 369 = 367. Then I have 37 and 32 left. If I add those two, 37 + 32 = 69. Then 367 + 69 = 436, which is still less than 482. Hmm, not quite.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 736 - 37 = 699. Then using 369 and 32. 699 - 369 = 330. Then 330 + 32 = 362. Nope, not there. Maybe 699 + 369 would be way too big. That's 1068, which is way over. Not helpful.\n\nWhat if I use multiplication? 37 times 32 is 1184. That's a big number. If I subtract that from 736, 736 - 1184 = negative number. Not useful. Maybe adding it? 736 + 1184 = 1920. Way too big. Hmm.\n\nWhat about dividing some numbers? Let's see. 369 divided by 37 is approximately 9.97. If I take that and multiply by 32, that's about 319. Then 736 - 319 = 417. Not 482. Alternatively, 369 divided by 32 is about 11.53. Multiply by 37, that's 426.6. 736 minus that is 309. Still not.\n\nWait, maybe combining subtraction and addition. Let's see, 369 is a large number. If I subtract 369 from 736, that's 367. Then maybe multiply 37 by 32. 37*32=1184. Then 367 + 1184=1551. That's way over. Not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use division to reduce a larger number. For example, 736 divided by something. 736 / 32 is 23. So 23. Then maybe 23 multiplied by something else. Let's see: 23 * 37 = 851. Then subtract 369? 851 - 369 = 482. Oh! Wait, that works. Let me check:\n\n736 / 32 = 23. Then 23 * 37 = 851. Then 851 - 369 = 482. Yes! All numbers are used once: 736, 32, 37, 369. Each is used exactly once, and the operations are division, multiplication, and subtraction. So the equation is (736 / 32) * 37 - 369 = 482.

But 599 + 83 is 682, which is more than 649. Hmm. If I subtract 30 from 599, that gives 569. Then add 83? 569 + 83 = 652. Close, but not 649. That's 3 off. Wait, maybe using 3 here. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe multiply some numbers. 30 is a medium number. Let's see: 30 times 3 is 90. 599 minus 90 is 509, which is way too low. Not helpful. What if I use 83? 30 times 83 is 2490. That's way too big. 599 minus 2490 would be negative. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe 83 times 3 is 249. Then add that to 599? 599 + 249 = 848. Still too big. Not helpful. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe add 599 and 83 first. 599 +83 = 682. Then subtract 30? 682-30=652. Still 3 more than needed. How to get rid of that 3. Wait, maybe use division. 30 divided by 3 is 10. So maybe 599 + 83 - (30/3). That would be 682 -10 =672. No, that's not right. Wait, 30/3 is 10. So 599 + (83 - 30/3) = 599 + (83-10)=599+73=672. Still not 649.\n\nHmm. Let's think differently. Maybe 83 times something. 83*7 is 581. But 7 isn't here. But 83* (3 + something). Wait, 3 is one of the numbers. 83* (30/3) would be 83*10=830. If I subtract that from 599, that's 599-830= -231. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 599 - (83*3) = 599 -249=350. Then add 30? 350+30=380. Not 649.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to combine the numbers in a different way. Let's see: 30 and 3. Maybe 30*3=90. Then 599 + 90=689. Then subtract 83? 689-83=606. Still not 649.\n\nAlternatively, 599 + (30*3) +83 = 599 +90 +83= 772. Nope.\n\nWait, 649 is 599 + 50. How can I get 50 from 30,3,83? 83-30=53. 53-3=50. So 599 + (83-30-3)=599+50=649. Wait, that would use all numbers: 599, 83,30,3. So the equation would be 599 + (83 -30 -3) =649. Let me check: 83-30 is 53, minus 3 is 50. 599+50=649. Yes! But the problem says each number is used once. So in this equation, 83,30,3 are all used in the parentheses. So the equation is 599 + 83 -30 -3 =649. That works. All numbers are used once, each. So the equation is 599 +83 -30 -3=649. Let me confirm: 599+83 is 682. Then subtract 30 is 652, subtract 3 is 649. Exactly. So that works. But wait, can I structure it as (599 +83) -30 -3?

Maybe subtract some of the larger numbers. For example, 79 is a big number. If I subtract something from 79 to get 84, that might not work because 79 is less than 84. Wait, 79 + something would be needed, but adding other numbers might overshoot. Let's check the sum of all numbers: 49 +79 +76 +32 = 236. That's way too big. So maybe combining operations.\n\nAlternatively, think about multiplication and division. 76 and 32: 76/32 is 2.375, but not sure. 76 -32 is 44. 49 +44 would be 93. Not helpful. Let me try different combinations.\n\nWhat if I take 79 and subtract something to get a base number. For example, 79 - 49 = 30. Then maybe use 76 and 32. 76 -32 = 44. 30 +44=74. Not 84. Close but not there. Hmm.\n\nAnother approach: maybe multiply two numbers to get a larger value and then subtract. For instance, 76 * 32 is 2432. That's way too big. Maybe 49 * 32 = 1568. Still too big. How about 79 - (76 / something). Let's see. 76 divided by 32 is 2.375. 79 - 2.375 is 76.625. Not helpful.\n\nWait, 79 - 49 = 30. Then 76 - 32 =44. Then 30 +44=74. No. Alternatively, maybe multiply 49 by something. 49*2=98. But where to get 2 from? 32/16=2, but 16 isn't in the numbers. Wait, maybe 79 - (76 - (32 / something)). Let me try this.\n\nAlternatively, 32 divided by something. 32 divided by 49 is about 0.653. Then 76 -0.653 =75.347. 79 -75.347=3.653. Not helpful.

Maybe reverse the operations. 79 - (76 -32) =79-44=35. Then 35 +49=84. Oh! Wait, that works. Let me check. 76-32=44. Then 79-44=35. Then 35+49=84. But we have to use all four numbers. So using 76,32 in 76-32, then 79- that result, then adding 49. So the equation would be (79 - (76 - 32)) +49 =84. Let's compute step by step:\n\n76 -32 =44.\n\n79 -44=35.\n\n35 +49=84. Yes!

I need to create an equation using the numbers 74, 14, 20, and 8 exactly once each, with basic operations, to get 220. Hmm. Let me start by thinking about what combinations could multiply or add up to 220.\n\nFirst, 220 is a bit large, so maybe multiplication is involved. Let's check if any of the numbers multiplied together get close. 74 is the biggest number here. If I multiply 74 by something... 74 * 3 is 222, which is close. But I don't have a 3. Wait, maybe 74 multiplied by 2.97... but that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe subtract something. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, 20 and 8 can be combined. 20 * 8 is 160. Then 160 + 74 would be 234, which is over. If I subtract 14, 234 -14 = 220. Wait, that might work. Let me check: 20 * 8 = 160, then 160 +74 = 234, then 234 -14 = 220. But are all numbers used once? 20,8,74,14—yes, all four. So that would be (20 * 8) +74 -14. Wait, does that work? Let me calculate:\n\n20*8 is 160. 160 +74 is 234. 234 -14 is 220. Yes! So that would be ((20 * 8) +74) -14. But let me check if parentheses are needed. Alternatively, the order might be 20*8 + (74-14). Wait, 74-14 is 60. 20*8 is 160. 160 +60 is 220. Oh, that's another way. So (20 *8) + (74 -14). That also works. Either way, both combinations use all numbers once. So maybe that's the equation. Let me verify:\n\n20*8 = 160. 74-14 = 60. 160+60=220. Perfect. So the equation would be (20 × 8) + (74 -14) = 220. Yes, that uses all numbers once. Let me check if there's another possible way, but this seems straightforward. So I think that's the solution. Let me just make sure I'm not missing any other combinations. For example, could I divide something? Let's see. 74 divided by something... 74/ something. 74/(8/20) would be 74*(20/8) = 74*2.5=185. Then adding 14 would be 199, which isn't 220. Alternatively, maybe 14*(20 -8) =14*12=168. 168 +74=242. Not 220. Hmm. What about 74 +14=88, then 88* (20-8). 88*12=1056, way too big. Maybe subtract: (74* (20 -8)) -14. Let's see: 20-8=12, 74*12=888, 888-14=874. No. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 74* (14 + (20/8)). 20/8 is 2.5, so 14+2.5=16.5. 74*16.5=1221. That's way over. No. How about (74 -20) * something. 74-20=54. 54* something. 54*4=216. If I have 8 and14 left. 14-8=6. 54* (14-8) =54*6=324. Not 220. Alternatively, 54* (8 - (14/ something)), but not sure. Maybe not.\n\nAnother approach: 220 divided by 74 is approximately 2.97. So if I can get close to 3 by combining the other numbers. Let's see, 14 +8 +20=42. No. 20 - (14/8)=20-1.75=18.25. 74*18.25 is way over. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, 220=20*11. Can I get 11 from 74,14,8? Let's see. 14 - (74/ something). 74 divided by 8 is 9.25. 14 -9.25=4.75. Not 11. 74 divided by (14-8)=6. 74/6≈12.33. Not helpful. Maybe 8 + (14/ something). 14/ something. If I use 74 and 20, maybe 14/(20- something). Not sure. Maybe 8 + (74-20)/something. 74-20=54. 54 divided by 14 is around 3.857. 8 +3.857≈11.857. Close but not exact. So 20*11.857≈237, which is more than 220. Not helpful.\n\nSo going back, the first idea was (20*8)+(74-14). Let's confirm again: 20*8=160, 74-14=60. 160+60=220. Perfect. All numbers used once. That seems to be the correct answer. Let me make sure there's no parentheses issue. If written as 20*8 +74 -14, the order of operations would still be multiplication first, then left to right. So 20*8=160, then 160+74=234, then 234-14=220. So even without parentheses, it would work. But to group them for clarity, maybe write (20*8) + (74 -14). Either way, the equation holds. So that's the solution.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(20 * 8) + (74 - 14) = 220</answer>"}]}

Let me think through how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should note the target number is 185. Let me see what operations might get me close. Since 100 is a large number, maybe I can use that as a starting point. If I subtract or add another number to 100, maybe that would help. Let me try some combinations.\n\nFor example, 100 + 24 = 124. Then I have 17 and 19 left. Hmm, 124 + 17 is 141, plus 19 is 160. That's too low. Alternatively, 100 + 24 is 124. If I subtract 17, that's 107, and then subtract 19, that's 88. Not helpful. How about multiplying?\n\nWhat if I do 100 - 24 = 76. Then I have 17 and 19 left. 76 +17=93, +19=112. Still not 185. Alternatively, 76*17=1292, which is way too big. Dividing 76 by 17 is about 4.47, not helpful. Maybe subtract 19 from 76? 76-19=57. Then add 17? 57+17=74. Not helpful.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe multiply two numbers together. 24 and 100 are the largest. 24*100=2400. That's way too big. But perhaps if I subtract something from that. 2400 - ... Hmm, but then I have 17 and 19 left. Let's see, 2400 -17 -19= 2400 -36=2364. Not close. Not useful.\n\nAlternatively, 24*17=408. Then subtract 19: 408-19=389. Then subtract 100: 389-100=289. Still not 185. Hmm.\n\nWhat if I take 100 divided by something. 100/24 is about 4.166. Then multiply by 17? 4.166*17≈70.8, plus 19≈89.8. Not enough.\n\nWait, maybe 100 + (24* something). Let's see. If I use 24 multiplied by one of the other numbers. 24*17=408. Then 100 + 408 = 508. Then subtract 19? 508-19=489. No. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 24*19=456. Then 100 +456=556. Subtract 17=539. Still way over.\n\nHmm, maybe subtract instead. 24*(100 - something). Let's try 100-17=83. 24*83=1992. Then subtract 19? 1992-19=1973. Nope.\n\nAlternatively, 24*(100 - 19)=24*81=1944. Then subtract 17=1927. Still way off.\n\nNot helpful. Let's think of combining 17 and 19 first. 17+19=36. Then 100 - 36=64. 64*24=1536. No. Not helpful. Alternatively, 17*19=323. Then 323 +100=423. 423 -24=399. Nope.\n\nWhat if I divide 100 by something. Let's say 100/(17-19). Wait, 17-19 is -2, so that's -50. Then multiplied by 24? -50*24=-1200. Adding the remaining number? But I already used all numbers. Hmm, not sure.\n\nWait, maybe using subtraction and addition. Let's see: 100 + 24 =124. Then 19 -17=2. So 124 +2=126. No. Not 185.\n\nAlternatively, 100 - (24 -17)=100-7=93. Then 93 +19=112. Still no.\n\nWait, maybe multiply 17 and 19 first, then do something. 17*19=323. Then 323 -100=223. Then 223 -24=199. Still not 185.\n\nAlternatively, 323 +24=347. Then 347 -100=247. No.\n\nWait, maybe 100 + (17* something). Let's see. 17*10=170, which would need 15 more. Hmm, but how to get 10 from 24 and 19. Maybe 24 -19=5. So 17*(24-19)=17*5=85. Then 100 +85=185. Wait, that works! Let me check:\n\n17*(24 -19) +100 = 17*5 +100 =85 +100=185. But wait, have I used all numbers? Let's see: 17,24,19, and 100. Yes, each used once. So that's the equation: 100 +17*(24 -19) =185. So that would be (24 -19)*17 +100 =185. But the way to write it with all numbers used once. Let me verify:\n\n24-19=5. 5*17=85. 85+100=185. Yes, that's correct. So the equation is 100 +17*(24 -19)=185. But according to the problem statement, you can use +, -, *, / as needed. So this uses -, *, +. Each number once. Perfect. So that's the answer.\n</think>\n\n<answer>100 + 17 * (24 - 19) = 185</answer>"}]}

All numbers must be used once, and only basic operations: +, -, *, /. Hmm. Let me start by thinking about the target number, 882. Let's break it down. 882 is a multiple of 49, because 49*18 is 882. Wait, 49*18 = 882. Oh, so if I can somehow get 49 multiplied by 18, that would work. But do I have an 18? Let me check the numbers I have: 69, 49, 1, 87. Hmm.

So if I can get 49 multiplied by something else, maybe. Let's see, the other numbers are 69, 1, 87. Let me see if combining 69, 87, and 1 can give me 18. Hmm. 69 minus 87 is negative, so that's not helpful. 87 minus 69 is 18. Oh! 87 - 69 is 18. Then, 49 * (87 - 69) would be 49*18 = 882. But I also have to use the number 1. Wait, I have to use all four numbers. So where does the 1 come in here?\n\nHmm, maybe I can use 1 in a division or addition. Let's see. If I have 49 multiplied by (87 - 69) plus 1, that would be 49*18 +1 = 882 +1=883, which is too much. Alternatively, subtracting 1 would make it 881. Not helpful. What if I can combine 1 with another number? Like 87 - 69 +1 = 19, then 49*19=931, which is not 882. Alternatively, maybe (87 - (69 +1)) = 17, then 49*17=833. No. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps 69 +1 =70, then 87 -70=17, same as before. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe the 1 is part of the multiplication. Let me think differently. Let's see, 69 * 49 is 3381. That's way too big. 87 * 49 is 4263. Also too big. 69*87 is 6003. Nope. 69*1=69. Not helpful. Wait, 49*18=882. So if I can get 18 from the other numbers, but including 1. So 87 - 69 = 18, but then 1 is left. How to use the 1? Maybe 1 divided by something? Or multiply by 1? If I do 49*(87 -69) *1, that's 49*18*1=882. But does that work? Because then I have used 49,87,69, and 1. Yes! Wait, let's check: 87 -69 =18. Then multiply by 49 and 1. So equation would be (87 -69) *49 *1. But since multiplication is commutative, that would be 49*(87-69)*1. So that equals 882. But does the order matter? Let me verify. Yes. So the equation would be (87 - 69) * 49 * 1. That uses all four numbers once each. Let me check the arithmetic: 87-69=18, 18*49=882, and 882*1=882. Yes, that works.

I need to create an equation using the numbers 91, 15, 765, and 79 exactly once each, with basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) any number of times, and the result should be 950. Hmm. Alright, let's start by thinking about the larger numbers first because 765 is a big number, and 950 is the target. Maybe if I subtract or add something from 765, that could get me closer. Let's see:\n\n765 plus 91 is 856. That's still under 950. Then adding 79 would be 856 + 79 = 935, and then adding 15 gives 950. Wait, but I have to use all numbers once. So that would be 765 + 91 + 79 + 15. Let me calculate that: 765 + 91 is 856, plus 79 is 935, plus 15 is 950. Oh! But that's just adding all of them. But wait, the problem says you can use the operations any number of times, but each number must be used once. So, is that allowed? Let me check the problem again: \"You can use basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) one or multiple times but each number can only be used once, and you must use all the numbers.\" So, if I just add all of them: 765 + 91 + 79 +15. Let's compute:\n\n765 + 91 = 856\n\n856 + 79 = 935\n\n935 +15 = 950. Yes! So that works. But wait, the problem didn't mention that you have to combine them with operations other than just addition. So is that acceptable? Because the user probably expects some combination of operations, but according to the problem statement, if you can just add them all, then that's valid. Let me check:\n\nWait, 765 +91 +79 +15. Let me add them step by step. 765 +91 is indeed 856. Then 856 +79 is 935. Then 935 +15 is 950. So that's correct. But each number is used once, and all are used. So that's a valid equation. But maybe I made a mistake here because the numbers add up exactly. Let me verify:\n\n765 +91 = 856\n\n856 +79 = 935\n\n935 +15 = 950. Yes, that's right. So the equation would be 765 + 91 + 79 + 15 = 950. But the problem might want an equation with operations, perhaps requiring more than just addition? Wait, no, the problem states that you can use the operations any number of times. So even if all operations are addition, that's acceptable. So maybe that's the answer. But let me double-check because sometimes these puzzles expect you to use different operations. Let me confirm the addition:\n\n91 +15 is 106. 765 +79 is 844. 106 +844 is 950. Wait, that's another way to add them. So yeah, addition works. So maybe the answer is simply adding all the numbers. But I need to check if all numbers are included and used once. Yes: 91,15,765,79. All are there. So maybe that's the solution. But maybe the problem expects a more complex equation. Let me check the problem again: \"create an equation that equals 950. You can use basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) one or multiple times but each number can only be used once, and you must use all the numbers.\" So according to that, using all numbers once with any combination of operations. So addition is allowed. So perhaps the answer is (765 + 91) + (79 +15) =950. Or just 765 +91 +79 +15 =950. But since parentheses aren't needed, maybe the equation is 765 + 91 + 79 + 15 = 950. Let me check again:\n\n765 +91 = 856\n\n856 +79 = 935\n\n935 +15 = 950. Correct. So that's the answer. But maybe the problem wants a different approach, but if this works, then that's the solution. Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to multiply some numbers to reach 950. Let me see.\n\nFor example, 15 * something. Let's think: 15 * 63 = 945, which is close. But how to get 63 from the remaining numbers. Wait, 79 - (765 / 91). Let's see: 765 divided by 91 is approximately 8.406. So 79 -8.406 is about 70.594. 15 *70.594 is about 1058.91, which is too high. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 765 - (something) = 950. But 765 is less than 950. So maybe addition is necessary. Alternatively, 765 + (something * something else). Let's see: 765 + (91 * 15) = 765 +1365=2130. Too much. 91*15=1365. Then 1365 +79=1444. Then 1444 -765=679. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe 765 + (91 - (79 -15)). Let's compute 79-15=64. Then 91-64=27. Then 765 +27=792. Not close to 950.\n\nAnother approach: 91 * 15 = 1365. Then 1365 - 765 = 600. Then 600 +79=679. Not 950.\n\nHmm. Let's think of division. 765 divided by 15 is 51. Then 51 * 79 = 4029. That's way too high. 51 * something else.\n\nAlternatively, 79 *15=1185. 1185 - 765 =420. 420 +91=511. Not helpful.\n\nHow about 91 * 79 =7189. That's way too big. 7189 divided by 15 is about 479.266. Then plus 765: 479.266 +765=1244.266. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 765 - 91=674. 674 +79=753. 753 +15=768. No.\n\nWait, maybe 765 - (91 +79 +15). That's 765 -185=580. Not 950.\n\nAlternatively, 765 * something. Let's see, 765 *1.241 approx gives 950. But how to get 1.241 from the other numbers. Using 91,15,79. Hmm, perhaps 79 / (91 -15). 91 -15=76. 79/76≈1.039. Then 765 *1.039≈794. Not enough. 765*(79/(91-15)) =765*(79/76)≈765*1.039≈794. Not 950.\n\nAlternatively, (765 +79) * (91 -15). 844 *76=64144. Way too big.\n\nWait, maybe (91 * 15) + (765 -79). Let's calculate: 1365 +686=2051. No.\n\nAnother approach: 950 divided by 15 is about 63.333. So maybe 63.333*15=950. But how to get 63.333 from the other numbers. 765 / (79 - something). 79 -91 is negative. Not useful. 765 divided by 79 is approx 9.683. 9.683 + something? Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 79 * (15) =1185. 1185 - 91=1094. 1094 -765=329. No.\n\nWait, maybe 765 + (79 * (15 - (91 / something))). Not sure. Let's try 91 divided by, say, 15. 91/15≈6.066. Then 15 -6.066≈8.933. 79*8.933≈707. 765 +707≈1472. No.\n\nAlternatively, 91* (15 - (765 -79)/something). Let's compute 765 -79=686. Then 686 divided by something. 686/15≈45.733. Then 15 -45.733≈-30.733. 91*(-30.733)= -2796. Not helpful.\n\nHmm. Maybe there's no other way except the straightforward addition. Let me check again: 765 +91 +79 +15. That's 765 +91 is 856, then +79 is 935, then +15 is 950. Yes. So that's valid. So the equation is 765 + 91 + 79 + 15 = 950. But wait, the numbers given in the problem are 91, 15, 765, 79. So 765 +91 +79 +15 uses all of them once. So that's correct. Therefore, the answer is simply adding all four numbers together. So maybe the problem is designed that way, and the user didn't notice that the sum is exactly 950. Let me confirm the addition once more:\n\n765\n\n+91\n\n=856\n\n856\n\n+79\n\n=935\n\n935\n\n+15\n\n=950. Correct. So the equation is valid. Therefore, the answer is <answer>765 + 91 + 79 + 15 = 950</answer>.\n</think>\n\n<answer>765 + 91 + 79 + 15 = 950</answer>"}]}

Let me start by listing the numbers and the target. The target is 614, which is a bit over 600. The numbers available are 94, 80, 75, and 365. Let me think about possible combinations.\n\nFirst, I notice that 365 is a large number, so maybe that can be part of a multiplication or division to get close. Let me try some operations. If I multiply 365 by something. Let's see, 365 * 2 is 730, which is higher than 614. If I can get 365 multiplied by 1.68 or so, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe subtract something from 365. But 365 is 365, and the other numbers are 94, 80, 75. If I subtract, say, 94 from 365, that's 271. Then adding 80 and 75 would get me 271 + 80 = 351 +75 = 426. That's way too low. So maybe subtraction isn't the way with 365.\n\nAlternatively, maybe add 365 and some other numbers. 365 + 94 = 459. Then 80 +75=155. 459 +155=614. Wait, that's exactly 614! Let me check: 365 +94 is 459, and 80 +75 is 155. Then 459 +155 = 614. But wait, the problem says we need to use each number exactly once and all of them. So if I do 365 +94 +80 +75, that's 365+94=459, 459+80=539, 539+75=614. Oh, that works! But wait, is that allowed? The question says to use all the numbers with basic operations. So addition is allowed. But wait, the example uses parentheses, but maybe here it's just adding all four numbers. Let me check: 365 + 94 + 80 +75. Let's calculate step by step. 365 +94 is 459. 459 +80 is 539. 539 +75 is 614. Yes! So that's possible. But wait, all numbers are used once, and the operations are all additions. But does the problem allow that? The problem says \"using the numbers 94,80,75,365, create an equation that equals 614. You can use basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) one or multiple times but each number can only be used once, and you must use all the numbers.\" So using only addition is allowed. So 365 +94 +80 +75=614. That's the equation. But let me check if the sum is correct. Let me add them again:\n\n365 + 94: 365 +90=455, plus 4=459.\n\n459 +80: 459 +80=539.\n\n539 +75: 539 +70=609, plus 5=614. Yes, correct. So the equation is 365 +94 +80 +75=614. But the problem might expect that you need to use different operations, but the instructions don't say that. It just says you can use the operations one or multiple times. So adding them all is a valid solution. So perhaps that's the answer. Let me see if there are other possible combinations, but this seems straightforward.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem expects a more complex equation, using different operations. Let me check. For example, maybe using multiplication or division. Let's see if there's another way. Let's try 365 * something. 365 * 2 is 730. If we can get 730 and subtract some of the other numbers. 730 - 94 = 636, which is still higher than 614. Then 636 -80=556, which is too low. Alternatively, 365 * 1 is 365. Then add 80* something. 80*3=240, 365+240=605. Then add 9 (from 94-75=19?), but that might not fit. Hmm. Alternatively, 365 + (80*3). Wait, but 80*3 would require using 80 once, but we can't use numbers more than once. Alternatively, maybe 365 + (94 * something). Let's see, 94*6=564. 365 +564=929, which is way too high. Maybe 365 - (94 + 75) = 365 - 169 =196. Then 196 +80=276. Not close.\n\nAlternatively, 365 divided by something. 365/5=73. But 5 isn't one of our numbers. So maybe not. Let's think of combining numbers. 94 and 80. 94 -80=14. Then 14 * something. 14 *44=616, which is close to 614. But how to get 44? The remaining numbers are 75 and 365. Hmm, maybe 75 - (365/ something). 365 divided by 5 is 73. 75-73=2. So 14*(75 - (365/5)). But we can't use 5 here. Wait, but we don't have a 5. So that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe 365 -75=290. Then 290 * something. 290*2=580. Then add 94 -80=14. 580+14=594. Not enough. Alternatively, 75*80=6000. That's way too big. 75*8=600, but we can't split numbers. 75*80=6000. Not helpful.\n\nAnother approach: 75* (something) + or - others. Let's see 75*8=600. If we have 75*(80/10)=600. But 10 is not a number here. Alternatively, 80 - (365/ something). Let's see 365 divided by 5 is 73, but again 5 isn't a number. Alternatively, 365 divided by 94. 365 ÷94 is approximately 3.88. Then 3.88 *75=291, then +80=371. Not close.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 365 -75=290. Then 290 *2=580. Then 580 +94=674. Then minus 80=594. No. Not helpful.\n\nWait, let's check again the straightforward addition. 365+94+80+75=614. That works. The problem says \"create an equation that equals 614. You can use basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) one or multiple times but each number can only be used once, and you must use all the numbers.\" So using all numbers once and adding them all is acceptable. So the answer is simply 365 +94 +80 +75 =614. So the equation is 365 +94 +80 +75 =614. Let me check once again:\n\n365 +94 = 459\n\n459 +80 = 539\n\n539 +75 =614. Yes, correct.\n\nSo the answer is <answer>365 + 94 + 80 + 75</answer>.\n</think>\n\n<answer>365 + 94 + 80 + 75</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using all the numbers 139, 13, 14, 70 exactly once, and the result should be 4. Hmm. Let's start by thinking about possible operations. Since 4 is a small number, maybe division or subtraction could help reduce larger numbers.\n\nFirst, let me list out the numbers: 139, 13, 14, 70. I have to use each once. Maybe I can pair some numbers. For instance, 139 and 13 might be related because 139 divided by 13 is... let's calculate. 13 times 10 is 130, so 139 divided by 13 is 10.692... Hmm, not a whole number. Maybe that's not helpful. Wait, 13 times 10 is 130, so 139 minus 13 is 126. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, 70 and 14. 70 divided by 14 is 5. That's a whole number. So 70/14=5. Maybe that's useful. Then I have 139 and 13 left. If I can get -1 from those, then 5 -1 =4. Let's see. 13 -139 would be negative, but maybe 139 minus 13 is 126. Not helpful. Wait, 139 divided by 13. Let's do that. 13*10=130, 13*10.69=139. So 139/13=10.692, which is not a whole number. Maybe subtract 13 from 139: 139-13=126. Then 126 divided by something... but I already used 13 and 139. Hmm.\n\nWait, if I use 70/14=5, then I need to combine 139 and 13 to get 9, because 5 + something=4? No, that doesn't add up. Wait, maybe 5 minus something=4. So I need 1 from 139 and 13. How? 139-138=1, but 138 is 13*10.615... Not helpful. Alternatively, 13 divided by something. 13 divided by 13 is 1, but I already used 13. Wait, but maybe 139 divided by 13 is 10.69, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, 13 - (something). Hmm.\n\nLet me try another approach. Let's consider combining numbers in different ways. Maybe (139 - 70) =69. Then 69 divided by 13? 69/13 is 5.307... Not helpful. Then 69 minus 14=55. Still not. Alternatively, 139 - (70 +14)=139-84=55. Then 55 divided by 13 is about 4.23, which is close to 4, but not exact. Hmm.\n\nWhat if I multiply numbers? 13*14=182. Then 182-139=43. Then 70-43=27. Not helpful. Or 13*14=182, 182+70=252, 252-139=113. No.\n\nAlternatively, 70 - (14* something). Let's see, 14*9=126, which is more than 70. Maybe 14*5=70. But 14*5=70, which is the same as 70. So maybe 70/14=5 again.\n\nWait, so 70/14=5. Then I have 139 and 13 left. How to get 5 -1=4. So I need to get 1 from 139 and 13. Let's see. Maybe 13 divided by 13 is 1, but I already used 13 once. Wait, but the numbers can only be used once. So 139 and 13 need to be used once. Maybe 139 - (13 * something). Let's try 13*10=130, so 139-130=9. Then 9 divided by something. But I already used 13 and 139. Hmm.\n\nWait, if I have 70/14=5, and then (139 - (13*10))=9. But how to get 10? Since I can only use numbers once. So maybe that's not possible. Alternatively, 139 divided by 13 is 10.692, but that's not an integer. Maybe subtract 139 -13=126. Then 126 divided by 14 is 9. Then 70 divided by something. Wait, 70 divided by 9 is not helpful. Alternatively, 126/14=9, then 9 - (70/13)=9 -5.384≈3.616. Not helpful.\n\nThis is tricky. Let's try different combinations. Maybe group 13 and 14 first. 13+14=27. Then 139-27=112. Then 112/70=1.6. Not helpful. Alternatively, 14-13=1. Then 139 -1=138. 138/70≈1.971. No.\n\nWhat if we do 70 - (14 -13) =70 -1=69. Then 139 -69=70. But we already used 70. Can't do that.\n\nAnother approach: Let's try to use multiplication and division to get closer. For example, (139 + 13) =152. 152 divided by something. 14 and 70 left. If 152/(70-14)=152/56≈2.714. Not 4.\n\nWait, 70 divided by 14 is 5. Then 5 multiplied by something. If I can get 5* something =4, but that would need 0.8. Not sure. Alternatively, 5 minus something=4, so need 1. So maybe 139 divided by 13 is 10.692, subtract 9.692 to get 1. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe (139 - (13 * something)) divided by something else. Let's see. Suppose 13 * 10 =130, then 139-130=9. Then 9 + (70/14)=9 +5=14. Not 4. Alternatively, 9 -5=4. Oh! Wait, that's possible. Let me check:\n\nIf I do 139 - (13*10)=9. But how do I get 10? Since I can't use numbers more than once. Alternatively, use 70 and 14 to make 5. So 70/14=5. Then maybe 13*5=65. Then 139-65=74. Not helpful.\n\nWait, another idea: 139 divided by 13 is approximately 10.69. Then subtract 70 divided by 14 which is 5. So 10.69 -5≈5.69. Not 4.\n\nAlternatively, 13 divided by (something) to get a fraction. Let's see. If I do (139 - (70/14)) /13. So 70/14=5, then 139-5=134. 134 divided by13 is 10.307. Not 4.\n\nHmm. Maybe subtract two larger numbers. For example, 139 -13=126. Then 126 -70=56. Then 56 divided by14=4. Oh! Wait, that works. Let's check:\n\n139 -13=126. Then 126 -70=56. Then 56/14=4. But here, we have to use all numbers: 139,13,70,14. So the equation would be (139 -13 -70)/14 =4. Let's verify:\n\n139-13=126; 126-70=56; 56/14=4. Yes! But wait, that uses all numbers: 139,13,70,14. Each once. And the operations are subtraction and division. So the equation is ((139 -13) -70)/14 =4. Let's write it as (139 -13 -70)/14. Does that equal 4? Let's compute step by step:\n\n139 -13 =126; 126 -70=56; 56/14=4. Yes! So that works. All numbers used once. Operations are subtraction and division. So the equation is (139 -13 -70)/14=4.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(139 - 13 - 70) / 14 = 4</answer>"}]}

Let's start by thinking about what operations might get me there. \n\nFirst, 308 is a bit over 300, so maybe combining some of the larger numbers. The biggest number here is 249. If I subtract something from 249, would that help? Let's check. 308 minus 249 is 59. So maybe if I can make 59 with the remaining numbers 57, 44, and 22. Wait, but 57 is close to 59. If I do 57 + (44 - 22), that's 57 + 22 = 79, which is too much. Or maybe 44 + 22 is 66. 57 + 66 is 123. Not sure how that helps. \n\nAlternatively, maybe multiply some numbers. 44 and 22 are both even. 44 * 22 is 968. That's a big number. If I subtract 249 from that, 968 - 249 = 719. Then adding 57 would make it 776. No, that's way off. Maybe divide instead. 44 / 22 is 2. So 57 + 2 = 59. Then 249 + 59 is 308. Wait, that's interesting. Let me write that down. \n\nSo, 249 + (57 + (44 / 22)) = 249 + (57 + 2) = 249 + 59 = 308. But does that use all the numbers? Yes: 249, 57, 44, and 22 are all used once. The operations are division and addition. Let me check that again. 44 divided by 22 is 2, then 57 plus 2 is 59, then 249 plus 59 is 308. Yep, that works. \n\nWait, but the problem says I can use the operations multiple times but each number only once. So in this case, the equation would be 249 + 57 + (44 / 22) = 308. Let me calculate that step by step. 44 divided by 22 is 2. Then adding 249 + 57 is 306, plus 2 is 308. Wait, 249 +57 is 306? Let me check: 249 + 50 is 299, plus 7 is 306. Yes. Then 306 + 2 is 308. So yes, that works. \n\nSo the equation would be 249 + 57 + (44 / 22) = 308. But let me check if there's another way, maybe using subtraction or multiplication. For example, maybe 249 - 57 = 192. Then 44 * 22 is 968. 192 + 968 would be 1160, which is too big. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 249 - (57 * something). 57 times 5 is 285, which is more than 249. Hmm. Maybe 57 * (44 - 22) = 57 * 22 = 1254. Then 249 + 1254 = 1503. Way over. Not helpful. \n\nWhat if I do 249 - (44 + 22) = 249 - 66 = 183. Then 183 + 57 = 240. Not enough. \n\nAlternatively, 44 * 7 is 308, but how to get 7 from the remaining numbers? The other numbers are 57, 249, and 22. Hmm. 57 - (249 /22) is about 57 - 11.318, which is around 45.682. Not helpful. \n\nAnother approach: 308 divided by 44 is 7. So maybe 44 * (something) =308. But to get 7, using 57, 249, and 22. Let's see. 22 - (249 /57) is 22 - approx 4.368 = 17.632. Not 7. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe 249 -57=192. 192 +44=236. 236 +22=258. No. \n\nWait, let me go back to the first idea. 249 +57 + (44/22) =308. That seems to work. Let me verify the arithmetic again. 44 divided by 22 is 2. Then 249 +57 is 306. 306 +2 is 308. Exactly. And all numbers are used once.

Wait, 49 divided by (something) to get 12? Not sure. Maybe 42 - (49 - 2) = 42 -47= -5. Not helpful.\n\nWait another approach. Let's see if multiplication can help. 2 times something. 2 * 35.5 is 71. But how to get 35.5 from the other numbers. 42 + 49 is 91, which is way over. 85 -49=36. Close. 2*36=72. That's 72, which is one more than 71. Maybe subtract 1, but we don't have a 1. Wait, maybe 2*(85 -49) - (42/42)? But we can't reuse 42. And we have to use all numbers. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, 49 + 2 =51. Then 85 - 42=43. 51 +43=94. No, that's too much. Not helpful.\n\nWhat if I do 85 - (49 / something). Let's see. 49 divided by something. 49/7=7, but we don't have 7. Wait, we have 42 and 2. 42/2=21. So 85 -21=64. Not enough.

Maybe a combination of multiplication and division. Let's try 85 - (42 / (something)). If I use 49 and 2. Let's see, 42 divided by 2 is 21. Then 85 -21=64. Then adding 49? 64+49=113. No, that's way over. Wait, but we can't add all numbers because we have to use each once. So maybe 85 - (42/2) +49. But that would use all four numbers: 85,42,2,49. Let's check: 42/2=21, 85-21=64, 64+49=113. Not 71. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 49*2=98. Then 98 - (85-42)=98 -43=55. Not 71.\n\nWait, 85 + something. 85 + (something)=71.

How to get 27 from 85 and 49. 85-49=36. So 44+36=80. Not 71.\n\nHmm. What if I subtract 85 and 42? 85 -42=43. Then 43 + 49=92. 92 +2=94. No. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe division. Let's see. 85 divided by something. 85/2=42.5. Then 42.5 +49 -42. But 42 is already used. Wait, maybe 85/(49-42) =85/7≈12.14. Then 12.14*2≈24.28. Not 71.\n\nAlternatively, 49 divided by 2=24.5. Then 85 -24.5=60.5. Then 60.5 +42=102.5. Not useful.\n\nHmm. This is tricky. Maybe using subtraction and addition in a different way. Let's see: 85 - (49 - (42 /2)). Let's compute inside the parentheses first: 42/2=21. Then 49-21=28. Then 85 -28=57. Not 71.\n\nWhat about (85 + 49) - (42 - 2). Let's compute: 85+49=134, 42-2=40. 134-40=94. No.\n\nAlternatively, 85 -2=83. Then 83 - (49 -42)=83 -7=76. Still not 71.\n\nWait, 42 + 49=91. Then 91 - (85/ something). 85 divided by 2 is 42.5. 91 -42.5=48.5. Not 71.\n\nWait, maybe 85 - ( (49 / 42) *2 ). Let's compute 49/42≈1.1667. Multiply by 2≈2.333. Then 85 -2.333≈82.666. Not helpful.\n\nHmm. Maybe combining operations. Let's think: (85 - 49) + (42 / 2). That's 36 +21=57. Still no.\n\nWait, 85 - ( (49 - 42) *2 ). 49-42=7. 7*2=14. 85-14=71. Oh! Wait, that works! Let me check: 49 minus 42 is 7, multiplied by 2 gives 14, subtracted from 85 gives 85-14=71. And all numbers are used once: 85,49,42,2. Yes! So the equation is 85 - (49 -42)*2 =71. Let me verify the calculation again. 49-42=7. 7*2=14. 85-14=71. Correct. All numbers used once. Perfect!\n</think>\n\n<answer>85 - (49 - 42) * 2 = 71</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using the numbers 29, 1, 71, and 99 exactly once each, with basic operations (+, -, *, /) to reach 58. Hmm. Alright, let me start by thinking about possible combinations.\n\nFirst, maybe I can break it down into smaller parts. Let's see, 58 is the target. Let me check if there's a way to use subtraction or division to get there. Since 58 is not too close to the larger numbers like 99 or 71, maybe combining them somehow.\n\nWait, 99 minus something. Let's see. 99 - 41 = 58. Hmm, can I get 41 from the remaining numbers? The remaining numbers would be 29, 1, and 71. Let's see. 29 + 1 = 30, which is not 41. 71 - 29 = 42, which is close but one more. 71 - (29 + 1) = 41. Oh! So 71 - (29 +1) = 41. Then 99 - (71 -29 -1) = 99 -41=58. Wait, let me check that again. If I do 99 - [71 - (29 +1)], that would be 99 - (71 -30) = 99 -41=58. But how do I structure this using all numbers once? Let's see.\n\nSo using 99, 71, 29, 1. Let's write it as 99 - (71 - (29 +1)) = 58. But that uses all four numbers: 99, 71, 29, 1. Each is used once. Let's check the calculation step by step.\n\nFirst, compute the innermost parentheses: 29 +1 = 30. Then subtract that from 71: 71 -30 =41. Then subtract that from 99: 99 -41=58. Yes, that works. So the equation would be 99 - (71 - (29 + 1)) = 58. But since we have to use all numbers exactly once and each operation is allowed, this seems to fit. Let me check if there are any other possibilities, but this seems promising.\n\nAlternatively, maybe another approach. Let's see, 29 + 1 =30. 71 -30=41. Then 99 -41=58. So that's the same as above. Alternatively, 99 -71 +29 +1. Let's compute that: 99-71=28, 28+29=57, 57+1=58. Wait, that also works! So (99 -71) +29 +1 =58. Let me check that: 99-71=28, 28+29=57, 57+1=58. Yes. That uses all numbers once. So that's another possible equation: 99 -71 +29 +1 =58. But wait, do I need parentheses here? Let me see. Since subtraction and addition are left associative, so 99-71 is 28, then +29 is 57, then +1 is 58. So the equation can be written as ((99 -71) +29) +1, but maybe without the parentheses, it's still correct. So perhaps 99 -71 +29 +1. Let me confirm that. Yes, according to order of operations, left to right for addition and subtraction. So that's valid.\n\nWait, but in that case, the equation would be 99 -71 +29 +1 =58. So using all four numbers once. That's a simpler equation. Hmm. But does that work? Let me compute step by step:\n\n99 minus 71 is 28. Then 28 plus 29 is 57. Then 57 plus 1 is 58. Yes. So that works. So that's another valid equation. Which one is better? The first one uses parentheses but maybe the second is more straightforward. But the problem allows any use of operations as long as each number is used once and all are used. So either equation is acceptable.\n\nWait, but the first equation uses parentheses in a nested way, but the second one doesn't. Let me check if there's any other way. For example, maybe using division or multiplication. Let's see. 29 and 1 could be combined as 29*1, but 29*1 is just 29. Maybe 99 - (71 -29)/1. Let's compute that: 71-29=42. 42/1=42. 99-42=57. Not 58. Close. If that was 99 - (71 -29)/1 + something, but we have to use all numbers. Hmm. Alternatively, 99 -71 + (29*1). That would be 28 +29=57. Then plus 1? No, but 29*1 is 29, so 99-71=28 +29=57, but we already used 29 and 1. Wait, no, in this case, if we do 99 -71 +29*1, that's 28 +29=57. But then 57 is not 58. Unless we add the 1 somewhere else. Wait, but the numbers are all used once. Wait, in this approach, 29*1 uses 29 and 1, and 99 and 71 are used in 99-71. So that would be 99-71 +29*1=28+29=57. Not enough. So need to get 58.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 71 - (99 / (29 -1)). Let's see. 29-1=28. 99 divided by 28 is approximately 3.535, which is not an integer. 71 minus that would be around 67.464. Not helpful.\n\nAnother idea: 29 + (99 -71) -1. Let's compute: 99-71=28. 29+28=57. 57-1=56. Not 58. Close, but no.\n\nHow about 29 + (99 -71) +1. Then 99-71=28. 28+29=57 +1=58. Wait, that's the same as the previous equation where it's 99-71 +29 +1. Yes. So that's another way to write it, grouping differently but same result.\n\nSo, the simplest equation seems to be 99 -71 +29 +1 =58. That uses all numbers once. Let me check again:\n\n99-71 is 28.\n\n28 +29 is 57.\n\n57 +1 is 58.\n\nYes. Perfect. So this equation works. Alternatively, maybe parentheses could be added for clarity, but according to order of operations, they are not necessary. However, the problem allows using operations multiple times. So in this case, three operations: subtraction, addition, addition.\n\nBut the problem says \"create an equation that equals 58\" using all numbers once. So either of the equations would work. The first approach I thought of was 99 - (71 - (29 +1)) which is 99 -41=58. The second approach is 99 -71 +29 +1=58. Both are valid. But which one to choose?\n\nMaybe the second one is simpler and uses fewer parentheses. Let's check the numbers:\n\n99, 71, 29, 1. All used once. The operations are -, +, +. So yes. So the equation is 99 -71 +29 +1 =58. Alternatively, written with parentheses: ((99 -71) +29) +1 =58. But since addition and subtraction are left-associative, it can be written without parentheses. However, sometimes including parentheses can make it clearer, but the problem doesn't specify formatting. The example given was (1 +2)/3. So maybe using parentheses even if not necessary. But in the case of 99 -71 +29 +1, the parentheses aren't needed. So perhaps that's acceptable.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"you can use basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) one or multiple times but each number can only be used once, and you must use all the numbers.\" So the equation could be written as 99 -71 +29 +1 =58. That uses all numbers once and three operations. So this seems correct. Let me check again the numbers: 99,71,29,1. All present once. Operations: -, +, +. Yes. So that's a valid solution.\n\nAlternatively, another approach. Let's see, 29 * something. 29 *2=58. How to get 2 from the other numbers. We have 1,71,99. Hmm. To get 2: maybe (71 - (99 - something))? Let's think. 99 - something =71 -2=69. So 99 -69=30. So 99 - (71 -2) would be 99 -69=30. But not helpful. Alternatively, (99 -71)/something. 99-71=28. 28 divided by 14 is 2. But how to get 14 from 1 and 29? 29-15=14, but no. 29-1=28, but that's 28. 28/28=1. Not helpful. Maybe (99 -71) divided by (29 - something). 28 divided by (29 - something). If 28 / (29 -x)=2, then x=15. But we don't have 15. Alternatively, 28/(something)=2. So something=14. But how to get 14 from 1 and 29? 29-15=14, but we don't have 15. 29-1=28. 28/2=14. But that would require using 2, which we don't have. Hmm. Not helpful.\n\nSo maybe the multiplication approach isn't the way to go. So going back, the earlier solution of 99-71+29+1=58 seems valid. Let me confirm once again. 99 minus 71 is 28. 28 plus 29 is 57. 57 plus 1 is 58. Yep. So that's correct. So this seems to be the answer.\n</think>\n\n<answer>99 - 71 + 29 + 1 = 58</answer>"}]}

I need to make an equation using all the numbers 3, 58, 72, 59 exactly once, and the result should be 48. The operations allowed are addition, subtraction, multiplication, division. Hmm. Let me start by thinking about how these numbers can combine. \n\nFirst, 72 is the largest number here, so maybe I can subtract something from it to get down to 48. If I take 72 minus something equals 48, then that something needs to be 24. So can I make 24 with the remaining numbers: 3, 58, 59? Let's check. 58 minus 59 is -1, which isn't helpful. 59 minus 58 is 1. Then multiplied by 3 gives 3. Not 24. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe 58 divided by something. 58 divided by (something) to get part of 24. Wait, maybe I can use division or multiplication with 3. For example, 59 minus 58 is 1, then 3 times 1 is 3. Then 72 - 3 = 69. Not 48. That's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 72 divided by something. 72 divided by 3 is 24. Then if I can get 24 from the other numbers. Wait, 59 minus 58 is 1, and then 24 times 1 would be 24. But 72 divided by 3 is 24, then 24 times (59 -58) would be 24. But then 72/3*(59-58) = 24, which is 24, not 48. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I need to do something else. Let's think about 59 and 58. Their difference is 1, which is small. Maybe combining them with 3. For instance, 59 - (58 / 3). But 58 divided by 3 is roughly 19.333, so 59 minus that is about 39.666. Then maybe 72 minus that? 72 - 39.666 is around 32.333. Not 48. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 72 minus 59 is 13. Then 58 divided by something. 58 divided by 13 is about 4.46. Then multiply by 3? 4.46 *3 ≈13.38. Still not 48.\n\nWait, maybe I can use multiplication and division. Let's see. What if I do 72 divided by (something) equals 48? Then 72 divided by 1.5 is 48. So how can I make 1.5 from 59, 58, and 3? 3 divided by 2 is 1.5. But how to get 2 from 59 and 58? 59 -58=1, but 1+1=2? No, I can't use numbers more than once. Wait, 59 minus 58 is 1, so 3 divided by (59 -58) would be 3/1=3. Then 72 divided by 3 is 24. Not helpful. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 72 - (59 -58) *3. That would be 72 - (1*3) = 72 -3 =69. Not 48.\n\nWhat if I do (72 -59) - (58 /3). Let's compute that: 13 - 19.333 ≈ -6.333. Nope.\n\nWait, maybe combine 58 and 3 first. 58 divided by 3 is about 19.333. Then 72 minus that is about 52.666. Then subtract 59? 52.666 -59 ≈ -6.333. Not good. If I add instead: 72 - (58/3) +59. That's 72 +59 =131 minus 19.333 ≈111.666. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 58*3=174. Then 174 minus 72=102, then subtract 59? 102-59=43. Not 48.\n\nHmm. Maybe another approach. Let's see: 48 is 6*8, or 12*4, etc. Let me see if I can get factors of 48. For example, 72 - 24 =48. How to get 24 from 3,58,59. 59 - 58 =1, then 3*1=3. So 24= (58 - (59 -3))? Let's check: 59-3=56, 58-56=2. Not 24. Alternatively, 58/ (something). 58 divided by (59/3) is 58/(19.666)≈2.95. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe 3*(58 - (72 -59))? Let's compute inside: 72-59=13. 58-13=45. 45*3=135. Not 48. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, (72 -58) * (59 -3)/ something. Wait, 72-58=14, 59-3=56. 14*56=784. That's way too big. Not helpful.\n\nWhat about (59 +58) =117. 117 -72=45. 45 +3=48. Wait, that uses all numbers: 59+58=117, minus 72=45, plus3=48. Let's check:\n\n(59 +58 -72) +3 = (117 -72) +3 = 45 +3 =48. But wait, are we allowed to use the numbers only once? Let's see: 59,58,72,3. Each is used once. Yes. So the equation would be (59 +58 -72) +3 =48. But I need to make sure the operations are correctly ordered. Let me write it as (59 +58 -72) +3. Alternatively, 59 +58 -72 +3. Since addition and subtraction are left to right. But parentheses might not be necessary. But according to the problem, it's okay to use operations multiple times. Let me check if that works: 59 +58 is 117, minus72 is 45, plus3 is 48. Yes. So that's 59 +58 -72 +3 =48. But wait, the problem states that all numbers must be used exactly once. In this equation, each number is used once. So yes. But the order of operations is just left to right. So the equation would be 59 +58 -72 +3 =48. But that's possible. Let me verify:\n\n59 +58 =117\n\n117 -72=45\n\n45 +3=48. Yes. That works. But does that use all the numbers? Yes: 59,58,72,3. Each is used once.\n\nSo the equation is 59 +58 -72 +3 =48. Alternatively, I can write it as (59 +58) -72 +3, but the parentheses aren't necessary. However, perhaps to group them for clarity. Let me check if that's allowed. The problem says any combination with the operations. So I think that's a valid solution. \n\nWait, but in the example given by the user, they have (1 + 2)/3. So maybe they prefer using parentheses to group operations. But in this case, 59 +58 -72 +3 is a valid equation. Let me check if the numbers are used once: 59,58,72,3. Yes. All used once. So that's the answer. \n\nAlternatively, maybe another solution exists, but this one works. Let me confirm again:\n\n59 +58 =117\n\n117 -72=45\n\n45 +3=48. Correct. So the equation is 59 +58 -72 +3 =48. So that's the answer.\n</think>\n\n<answer>59 + 58 - 72 + 3 = 48</answer>"}]}

Let me look at the numbers. 62 is already a big number, so maybe that can be the base. If I can multiply 62 by something to get close to 620. Let's see, 62 times 10 is 620 exactly. Oh, wait!

Let me start by thinking about the target number, 931. It's a relatively large number, so maybe multiplication will be involved here. \n\nFirst, let me list the numbers I have: 93, 6, 94, 15. The target is 931. Let's think about possible combinations. Since 93 and 94 are both close to 100, maybe combining them in some way. Let's see, 93 multiplied by something. 93*10 is 930, which is just 1 less than 931. Wait, 930 is close. If I can get 93*10 +1, but how to get 10 and 1 from the remaining numbers. Wait, but the numbers I have left after using 93 would be 6, 94, 15. Hmm. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 94* something. 94*10 is 940, which is 9 more than 931. So 94*10 -9 would be 931. But again, how to get 10 and 9 from the remaining numbers. Let's see. The remaining numbers would be 93, 6, 15. Maybe 15 -6 is 9. Then 94*(15 -6) - something. Wait, 15-6=9. Then 94*9=846. Then maybe subtract 93? 846 -93=753. Not helpful. Maybe that's not the way.\n\nWait, maybe if I use multiplication and addition. Let's see: 93*10 is 930, so 930 +1. But how to get 10 and 1. The remaining numbers are 6, 94, 15. Let's see, 15 -6 is 9, but not 10. Alternatively, 94 divided by something. 94 divided by 15 is about 6.266, which might not be helpful. 94 divided by 6 is around 15.666. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe combine 93 and 94 first. 93 +94=187. Then multiply by something. 187*5=935, which is 4 more than 931. But where would I get 5 from? The remaining numbers are 6 and 15. 15-6=9, 15/6=2.5. Not 5. Hmm. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe think of 931 as 930 +1. So 93*10 +1. But how to get 10 and 1. Let's see: the remaining numbers are 6,94,15. Maybe 15 - (94/6). Let's calculate 94 divided by 6: that's 15.666..., so 15 -15.666... is negative. Not 10. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 94 - (15/6). 15/6 is 2.5, so 94 -2.5=91.5. Then 93*91.5 would be way too big. No.\n\nWait, perhaps subtraction. Let's see. 931 is 940 -9. 940 is 94*10. So 94*10 -9. How to get 10 and 9. The remaining numbers are 93,6,15. 15 -6=9. So 94*(something) - (15-6). If the something is 10, then where do we get 10? But 93 is left. Hmm. 93 can't make 10. Unless 93 divided by 9.3 is 10, but 9.3 isn't among the numbers. Alternatively, maybe 15 -6=9, and 94* (something) -9. Wait, but how to get the 94 multiplied by something to reach 940. Wait, 94*10 is 940. So 94*10 -9=931. So how to get 10 from 93 and 15. Wait, 93 divided by 15 is 6.2, but 15 and 6 are separate numbers. Hmm. Maybe that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps combining 93 and 15. 93 +15=108. Then 108* something. 108*8=864, which is lower than 931. 108*9=972, which is higher. Maybe not.\n\nWait another angle: Let's try to use multiplication and division to create larger numbers. For example, 94*15=1410. If I subtract 93*6=558, then 1410-558=852. Not 931. Hmm. 94*15 is 1410. 93*6=558. 1410 -558=852. No. Alternatively, 94*6=564. Then 564 +93=657, plus 15=672. Not enough. Hmm.\n\nWhat if I do 93*15=1395. Then subtract 94*6=564. 1395-564=831. Still not 931. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe 94* (15 -6) +93. Let's compute that: 15-6=9. 94*9=846. 846 +93=939. Close, but 939 is 8 more than 931. Hmm. Not quite.\n\nAlternatively, 94*(15 -6) -93. 94*9=846. 846-93=753. No.\n\nHow about 93*(15 -6) +94. 15-6=9. 93*9=837. 837+94=931. Oh! Wait, that works. Let's check again:\n\n93 multiplied by (15 minus 6) plus 94. So 15-6=9. 93*9=837. 837 +94=931. Yes! That uses all numbers: 93, 15, 6 (in 15-6), and 94. So the equation is 93*(15 -6) +94 = 931.\n\nLet me verify the arithmetic step by step. First, 15 -6 is 9. Then 93 multiplied by 9: 93*9. 90*9=810, 3*9=27, so 810+27=837. Then 837 +94: 837 +94 is 931. Correct. All numbers are used exactly once: 93, 6 (used in 15-6), 15 (also in 15-6), and 94. Perfect. So the equation is 93*(15 -6) +94 =931.\n</think>\n\n<answer>93 * (15 - 6) + 94 = 931</answer>"}]}

Multiplication is probably going to be involved here. Let's look at the numbers given: 40, 92, 21, 89. These are all two-digit numbers except 40. Let's see which combinations might multiply to get close to 843.\n\nLet me start by trying to multiply the two largest numbers: 92 and 89. 92 * 89 = let's calculate that. 90*90 is 8100, so 92*89 is (90+2)*(90-1) = 90^2 + 2*90 -1*90 -2 = 8100 + 180 -90 -2 = 8100 + 88 = 8188. Wait, that's way too big. But maybe if we subtract something? But 8188 is way over 843. Hmm, that's not going to work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe multiplying 92 by a smaller number. Let's see: 92 * 21 = 1932. That's still way over 843. Then 40 * 21 = 840. Oh, 840 is very close to 843. So if I can get 840 from 40*21, then maybe adding 3. But where do I get 3? Let's see, the remaining numbers would be 92 and 89. How can I get 3 from 92 and 89? 92 - 89 = 3. So maybe 40*21 + (92 -89) = 840 +3 = 843. Let me check that:\n\n40 *21 is 840. Then 92 -89 is 3. Adding those gives 843. Yes! But wait, I need to use all four numbers: 40, 92, 21, 89. In this equation, I use all four. 40, 21, 92, 89. So yes. The equation would be (40 * 21) + (92 - 89) = 840 +3 = 843. Let me verify the arithmetic:\n\n40 *21: 40*20=800, 40*1=40, so 800+40=840. Then 92-89=3. 840+3=843. Perfect. That uses all four numbers once each with multiplication, addition, and subtraction. So the equation is (40 * 21) + (92 - 89) = 843. Let me check if that's correct. Yes, that seems to work. Let me just make sure there's no other possible way, but this seems straightforward and uses all numbers once.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(40 * 21) + (92 - 89) = 843</answer>"}]}

Hmm, 360 is a multiple of 10, 12, 15, etc. Let me think about factors here.\n\nFirst, 360 divided by 12 is 30. So maybe if I can get 30 from the other numbers and multiply by 12. Let's check the numbers left: 19, 15, 38. Hmm, 38 minus 19 is 19, but that's not helpful. 38 minus 15 is 23. 38 plus 15 is 53. Not 30. How about 38 minus (19 +15)? 38 - 34 = 4. No, that's not it.\n\nWait, 15 times 2 is 30, but I don't have a 2. Unless I can use division. Maybe 38 divided by 19 is 2. Then 15 times (38/19) = 15*2=30. Then 30*12=360. Oh! Let me check that. So 38 divided by 19 is 2. Then multiply by 15 to get 30. Then multiply by 12. But does that use all numbers? Let's see: 38,19,15,12. Yes. So the equation would be (15 * (38 / 19)) * 12. Let me compute that step by step. 38 divided by 19 is 2. 15 times 2 is 30. 30 times 12 is 360. Perfect! That uses all numbers once. So the equation is (15 * (38 / 19)) * 12. Let me check if I can write it with the numbers in order or if the parentheses are correct. Alternatively, maybe 15 * 38 / 19 *12. Since division and multiplication are left to right, 38/19 is 2, then 15*2=30, then 30*12=360. So maybe no parentheses needed. But to make sure the order is correct, maybe write it as (15 * 38 / 19) *12. Wait, but the original numbers are 19,15,38,12. The order doesn't matter as long as each is used once. So the equation can be structured as (15 × (38 ÷ 19)) × 12 = 360. Alternatively, 38 ÷ 19 = 2, then 2 × 15 = 30, 30 ×12=360. So the equation would be ((38 / 19) * 15) * 12. But I need to represent all numbers once. So that uses 38,19,15,12. Correct. Another way: 12 * 15 * (38 /19). Let's see: 38/19=2, 12*15=180, 180*2=360. That also works. So maybe that's a simpler way. So 12 *15 * (38/19). Let me check the calculation again. 38 divided by 19 is 2. 12 times 15 is 180. 180 times 2 is 360. Yes. So that's another valid equation. Which one is better? Both are valid. Since the problem doesn't specify the order, either is fine. Let me write it as (12 * 15) * (38 / 19). That's 180 * 2 = 360. Yep. That uses all numbers once. So the equation is (12 * 15) * (38 / 19) = 360. Alternatively, maybe even 38/19*15*12. As multiplication is commutative, the order can vary. But the key is all numbers are used once. So that works.\n</think>\n\n<answer>((38 / 19) * 15) * 12</answer>"}]}

The other numbers are 57, 43, and 88. How can I combine those to get 48? Let's see: 88 minus 57 is 31, which isn't 48. 57 minus 43 is 14. 88 minus 43 is 45. Close. 88 - 43 is 45, then maybe subtract 57? No, that would be negative. Wait, if I do 88 - (57 + 43). Let's calculate that: 57 +43 is 100. 88 minus 100 is -12. Not helpful. What if I do 57 - (88 -43)? 88-43 is 45, then 57-45 is 12. Still not 48.\n\nAlternatively, maybe multiply some numbers. Let's think. 57 and 43 are both prime? 57 is 3*19, 43 is prime. 88 is 8*11. Maybe combining them through multiplication. 57*43 is a big number, probably too big. Let me check: 57*40 is 2280, plus 57*3 is 171, so 2451. That's way over 240. So multiplying all would be too much. Maybe divide? 88 divided by something. If I do 88/(57-43) = 88/14 ≈6.285. Then multiply by 5? 5*6.285 is about 31.4. Not 240. Hmm.\n\nWait, another approach.

Then 188 +5=193. Still not. What if we do 88*5=440. Then subtract 57 and 43. 440 -57=383, 383-43=340. Not 240. Alternatively, 88*5=440, then subtract (57+43)=100. 440-100=340. Still no. Maybe 88 divided by something. 88/(5) is 17.6. Then 17.6*(57-43). 57-43=14. 17.6*14=246.4. Close to 240, but not exact. Hmm. Maybe 57 divided by something. Let's see.\n\nWait, let's try combining numbers in a different way. Let's think of 240 as 48*5. So 5 is used. Then how to make 48 from 57, 43, 88. Maybe 88 - (57 -43). Let's see: 57-43=14. 88-14=74. 74*5=370. Not 240. Alternatively, (57 -43) * something. 57-43=14. 14*17=238, which is close. Not helpful. Wait, 88 -43=45. 45 plus 57 is 102. 102* something. 102*2.35 is 240. But not sure how to get that. \n\nAnother idea: Maybe 88 - 57 =31. Then 43 -31=12. 12 *5* something. Wait, 12*5=60. Not enough. Wait, but if 88 -57 is 31, then maybe 43 - (88 -57)=43-31=12. Then 12*5*4=240. But I don't have a 4. Hmm. Alternatively, 57*5=285. Then subtract 88-43=45. 285-45=240. Wait, that works! Let me check: 57*5 is 285. Then 88 -43 is 45. 285 -45=240. Yes! So the equation would be (57*5) - (88 -43) =240. Let me verify each number is used once: 57,5,88,43. Yes, all used once.

If I multiply them, 62*36 is 2232, which is way too big. Hmm. Maybe combining them with addition first? 62 + 36 is 98. Then multiply by something else. Let's see. But 98*10 is 980, which is still under 1000. Maybe subtract 27? 980 -27 is 953. Not close.\n\nWait, maybe a different approach. Let's see the target is 465. Let me break it down. 465 divided by 10 is 46.5. Maybe using 10 as a divisor? So if I can get 46.5*10, but 46.5 is 465/10. But how to get 46.5 from 62, 36, 27. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 62 multiplied by something. Let's see: 62*7.5 is 465. How can I get 7.5 from 10, 36, and 27? Let's see. 36 divided by something... 36/10 is 3.6. Then 3.6 + 27 is 30.6. That's not helpful. Wait, 27 - (36/10) is 27 - 3.6 = 23.4. Still not 7.5.\n\nWait, maybe 27 divided by something. 27 divided by 3.6 is 7.5. How to get 3.6 from 36 and 10. Oh, 36 divided by 10 is 3.6! So maybe 27/(36/10) = 27/(3.6) = 7.5. Then 62 * 7.5 = 465. So putting that together: 62 * (27 / (36 / 10)) = 62 * (27 * 10 / 36) = 62 * (270/36) = 62 * 7.5 = 465. And that uses all the numbers: 62, 27, 36, 10. Each once. Let me check the order of operations. Yes, division is done before multiplication here, but parentheses would make it clearer. So the equation would be 62 * (27 / (36 / 10)) = 465. Let me verify the calculation:\n\n36 divided by 10 is 3.6. Then 27 divided by 3.6 is indeed 7.5. 62 times 7.5 is 465. Yep, that works.

Let's start by thinking about how these numbers can interact. \n\nFirst, 726 is the largest number here. Maybe I can divide that by one of the smaller numbers to get closer to 291. Let's try dividing 726 by something. If I divide 726 by 23, that gives me 726 / 23 = 31.565… which isn't too far from 291, but not quite. Alternatively, 726 divided by 20 is 36.3, which also doesn't help much. Wait, maybe if I subtract something from 726 first before dividing. Like (726 - x) / y = 291. Let's see. If (726 - x) / y = 291, then 726 - x = 291*y. Let's check possible y values. The smaller numbers are 20, 23, 52. Let's try y=20. Then 291*20=5820, which is way larger than 726. Not helpful. If y=23, then 291*23=6693. Still way too big. Maybe that approach isn't right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe multiply some numbers and then subtract others. Let's see. 52 * 23 is 1196. If I subtract 726 from that, 1196 - 726 = 470. Then subtract 20? 470 -20=450. Not 291. Hmm. Maybe divide first. 726 divided by 23 is about 31.56, then subtract 52: 31.56 -52 would be negative. Not helpful.\n\nWhat if I use 52 and 20 together. 52 +20=72. Then 72 * something? 72*4=288, which is close to 291. If I can get 72*4 +3, but where would the 3 come from? Not sure. Alternatively, 72 * (something) = 291. 291 divided by 72 is about 4.04. So maybe 52 +20=72, then multiply by (726 divided by 23). Wait, 726 divided by 23 is 31.565... So 72 * 31.565 would be way over. Not helpful.\n\nWait, 726 divided by something. Let's see 726 divided by 52 is around 14. Let's see 14*20=280, which is close to 291. But then how to use the remaining 23. Maybe 726/52 is 14. Then 14*20=280. Then 280 +23=303, which is over. Not helpful. Or 280 -23=257. Not 291.\n\nAlternatively, 23*20=460. Then 726 -460=266. Then 266 +52=318. Not 291. Hmm.\n\nWhat if I do 726 - (52*23). Let's calculate 52*23=1196. 726 -1196= -470. That's way off. Not useful.\n\nWait, maybe start with 23 and 20. 23*20=460. Then 726 -460=266. Then 266 +52=318. Still not. Alternatively, 460 -726= -266. Then add 52: -214. No. \n\nAlternatively, 726 divided by 23 is 31.565. Then 31.565 +52=83.565. Then 83.565 * something? Maybe multiply by 20? That would be 1671.3. No. Not helpful.\n\nLet me try another approach. Let's think of 291 and see what combinations can get there. 291 is 300-9, or 250+41, etc. Maybe using subtraction or addition. For example, 726 - 435 = 291. So if I can get 435 from the other numbers. The remaining numbers are 52,23,20. How? 52*23=1196. Too big. 52*20=1040. Also too big. 52+23+20=95. Not 435. Hmm. Maybe (52+23)*20 = 75*20=1500. Still not 435. Alternatively, 52*(23-20)=52*3=156. Not 435. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe 726 - (52*(23 +20)). Let's calculate 23+20=43. 52*43=2236. 726 -2236= negative, so that's -1510. Not 291.\n\nAlternatively, (726 -52*23) -20. Let's compute 52*23=1196. 726-1196= -470. -470-20= -490. Not helpful.\n\nHmm. Maybe division is necessary. Let's try using division. For example, 726 divided by something. Let's see 726 / 2.5=290.4, which is close to 291. But how to get 2.5 from the remaining numbers. The numbers left would be 52,23,20. Wait, 52 divided by 20 is 2.6. 2.6 is close to 2.5. So if I do 726 / (52/20) = 726 * (20/52) = (726*20)/52. Let's compute that. 726*20=14520. Divided by 52: 14520 /52 = 279.23... Close to 279.23. Then subtract 23? 279.23 -23=256.23. Not 291. Or add 23: 279.23 +23=302.23. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 726 divided by (23 - (20/52)). Let's see. 20/52≈0.3846. 23 -0.3846≈22.615. Then 726 /22.615≈32.09. Then multiply by 52? Wait, but we've already used 23, 20, 52. Hmm. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 23*(52 -20) + something. Let's compute 52-20=32. 23*32=736. Then subtract 726: 736-726=10. Not 291. Or add 726: 736+726=1462. Nope.\n\nWait, what if we do (726 / (23 +20)) *52. Let's see. 23+20=43. 726/43≈16.8837. Multiply by 52: 16.8837*52≈878.75. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 726 divided by 23 is 31.565. Then multiply by 20: 31.565*20=631.3. Then subtract 52: 631.3-52=579.3. Not close.\n\nHmm. Maybe combine 52 and 20 in a different way. 52-20=32. 32*23=736. Then 736 -726=10. Again, same as before. Not helpful.\n\nWait, let's think of 291 as a product. 291 factors? Let's see. 291 divided by 3 is 97. So 3*97. But do we have 3 and 97? Maybe not. Alternatively, 291=200+91. How to get 200 and 91 from the numbers. 52*20=1040. That's too much. 23*20=460. Also too much. 23*4=92. Close to 91. But how to get 4 from the remaining numbers. 52-20=32. 32/ something? Not sure.\n\nWait another angle: 52 + 726 = 778. Then 778 - 23 = 755. 755 -20=735. Not helpful. Alternatively, 726 -52=674. Then 674 -23=651. 651 -20=631. Still no.\n\nAlternatively, (726 +23) - (52*20). Let's compute 726+23=749. 52*20=1040. 749-1040= -291. Oh, that's negative 291. But we need positive. So maybe reverse the order: (52*20) - (726 +23). 1040 -749=291. Wait, that works! Let's check the numbers: 52, 20, 726, 23. All used once. The equation is (52 * 20) - (726 +23) = 291. Let's compute:\n\n52*20=1040\n\n726+23=749\n\n1040 -749=291. Yes! That works. So the equation is (52*20) - (726 +23) = 291. Let me verify that all numbers are used exactly once. 52, 20, 726, 23—yes, all used once. Perfect.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(52 * 20) - (726 + 23) = 291</answer>"}]}

I need to use the numbers 13, 3, 40, and 25 each exactly once, combining them with basic arithmetic operations to get 935. Hmm, that's a big number. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, 935 is quite large compared to the numbers given. So maybe multiplication is involved here. Let's check the possible products. The largest numbers here are 40 and 25. Multiplying those gives 1000. Wait, 40 times 25 is 1000. Then 1000 minus 65 would be 935, but how do I get 65 from 13 and 3? 13 times 5 is 65, but I only have 3 left. Alternatively, 13 plus 3 is 16, which isn't helpful. Wait, 13 multiplied by 5 is 65, but where would the 5 come from? Maybe I can combine 3 with another number somehow.\n\nWait, maybe instead of 40*25 first, perhaps there's another way. Let's see. If I take 40 and 25 first. 40*25 is 1000. Then 1000 minus something. If I use 13 and 3 to make 65, then 1000-65=935. But how to get 65 from 13 and 3. 13*5=65, but I only have 3. Wait, 3 can't be turned into 5. Alternatively, 13*(3 + something), but that requires another number which we don't have. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe 40*25 is 1000. Then 13*3 is 39. So 1000 - 39 = 961. That's not 935. Hmm. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 40*25 is 1000, and then subtract (13*3) which is 39. 1000-39=961, which is still not 935. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a way to combine 40 and 13 first. 40*13=520. Then 520 plus something. Let's see. 25*3=75. 520+75=595. Not enough. Or 520*3=1560, which is way over. Maybe divide? 520/3 is not an integer. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, 25*13=325. Then 325*3=975. Close to 935, but 975-40=935. Wait, that's 25*13*3 -40=975-40=935. Let's check. 25*13=325, 325*3=975. Then 975-40=935. But have I used all the numbers? Let's see: 25,13,3,40. Yes, all four numbers are used once. Wait, but is that correct? Let me re-calculate:\n\n25 * 13 = 325.\n\n325 * 3 = 975.\n\n975 - 40 = 935.\n\nYes, that works. Let me verify the numbers used: 25,13,3,40. Each is used exactly once, and all are used. So the equation would be (25 * 13 * 3) - 40 = 935. But the problem says to write the equation using the numbers in some order. Does the order matter? Well, the problem doesn't specify the order, just that each number is used once. So the equation would be ((25 * 13) * 3) - 40 = 935. Alternatively, written as (25 * 13 * 3) - 40. Since multiplication is associative, the parentheses can be arranged as needed. So that's a possible solution.\n\nLet me check another way to see if there's another possibility. For example, maybe 40*25 is 1000, then subtract 13*5, but we don't have 5. Wait, 25 divided by 5 is 5, but that would require using 25 again, which isn't allowed. Alternatively, 40 - (25/ something) but not sure. Alternatively, 40* (25 - something). Let's try 25 - (13/3). But 13/3 is not an integer, and that would give 25 - 4.333... which is 20.666..., multiplied by 40 gives 826.666..., which is not 935.\n\nAlternatively, 40 + 25 = 65, then 65 * 13 = 845. 845 + 3* something. 3*30=90, but 845+90=935. Wait, but how to get 30 from the remaining numbers. Wait, but all numbers must be used once. If I do 40+25=65, 65*13=845, then 845 + (3*30)=935. But where does 30 come from? I don't have 30. That's not possible. So this approach doesn't work.\n\nHmm, the earlier approach seems valid. Let me just confirm the calculation again. 25*13 is 325. 325*3 is 975. 975 minus 40 is indeed 935. So the equation would be (25 × 13 × 3) − 40 = 935. But let me check if that's the correct way to write it using each number once. Yes, 25, 13, 3, and 40 are each used once. So that's the equation.\n</think>\n\n<answer>((25 * 13) * 3) - 40 = 935</answer>"}]}

I need to use the numbers 1, 12, 4, and 61 each exactly once, and combine them with basic arithmetic operations to get 183. Hmm. All right, let's start by thinking about the possible operations.\n\nFirst, 61 is the largest number here, so maybe I can use that as a base. Let's see. 183 divided by 61 is 3. So if I can get 3 from the other numbers (1, 12, 4), then 61 times 3 would be 183. But wait, how do I get 3 from 1, 12, and 4? Let's see. 12 divided by 4 is 3. Oh, right! So if I take 12 divided by 4, that's 3. Then multiply that by 61 to get 183. But I still have the 1 left. Wait, but I need to use all the numbers. So that approach uses 61, 12, and 4, leaving out 1. That's a problem. So that's not going to work.\n\nHmm. Maybe I can adjust that. Let's see. 61 times 3 is 183. But how to incorporate the 1? Maybe 12 divided by 4 is 3, and then add 1? That would make 4. Then 61 times 4 is 244, which is way over. Not helpful. Alternatively, subtract 1? 3 minus 1 is 2. Then 61 times 2 is 122. Still not 183. So that approach might not work. Let me think differently.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe start with 61 and subtract something. 61 minus something equals 183? Wait, no, 61 is less than 183, so subtracting would make it even smaller. Maybe add. 61 plus something. Let's calculate 183 minus 61, which is 122. So I need to get 122 from 1, 12, and 4. Let's see. 12 times 4 is 48. 48 plus 1 is 49. Not enough. 12 times 10. Hmm, but 12* (4 + something). Wait, 12*10 is 120, but how to get 10 from 1 and 4? 4 + 1 =5, so 12*(4 +1) = 60. Then 60 + 61 = 121, which is still not 183. No.\n\nAlternatively, maybe multiply 12 and 4 first. 12*4=48. Then 48 +1=49. 61 +49=110. Not 183. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe division. Let's see. If I take 61 and multiply by (12 / (4 -1)). Let's check that: 4-1=3. 12/3=4. 61*4=244. That's too much. Not helpful.\n\nOr maybe 61 * (12 - 4) +1. 12-4=8. 61*8=488. 488+1=489. Nope. Not good.\n\nAlternatively, 61 + (12 * 4 *1). That's 61 + 48=109. Still not. How else?\n\nWait, maybe using subtraction. 61 * 3 =183, but how to get 3 using 12,4,1. Wait, 12 / (4 +1) =12/5=2.4. Not 3. Alternatively, (12 -1)/ (4). 11/4=2.75. Not 3. Hmm.\n\nWait, what if we do 61 * 3 + something? But we have to use all numbers. Maybe 61*(12 - (4 +1)). Let's compute that: 4+1=5. 12-5=7. 61*7=427. No. Not 183.\n\nWait, maybe using subtraction. Let's think: 61 * 4 =244. Then subtract 12* something. 244 - (12*1)=244-12=232. Still not. Alternatively, 244 - 12/1=244-12=232. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 61 * (4 -1) +12. Let's see: 4-1=3. 61*3=183. Then adding 12 gives 195. No. Wait, but I have to use all numbers. So that uses 61,4,1,12. Wait, 61*(4-1)=183, and then adding 12 would be 195. But the problem is that if I do 61*(4 -1) +12, that's 183 +12=195. But we need exactly 183. Alternatively, subtract? 61*(4 -1) -12 =183-12=171. Not 183. Hmm.\n\nWait, but 61*(4 - (1)) is 183. So if I use 61*(4-1), that's 3. Then 61*3=183. But that uses 61,4,1. Then where does 12 come into play? Oh, but the 12 is left out. So that's a problem. So that approach can't work because we have to use all numbers. So that's the issue.\n\nWait, maybe there's a way to combine the numbers with division or something else. Let's try different combinations. Let's see. Maybe (12 * 4) + 61 +1. 12*4=48. 48+61=109. 109+1=110. Not 183.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, 12*(61 -4) +1. Let's compute: 61-4=57. 12*57=684. 684+1=685. Way too big. Not helpful.\n\nWait, 61 + 12 =73. 73* (4-1)=73*3=219. 219- something? But 219 is already over. Maybe 73* (4 -1) - something else. Not helpful.\n\nWhat if we do (61 -1) * (12 /4). Let's see: 61-1=60. 12/4=3. 60*3=180. Close, but not 183. Then 180 plus 3? Wait, but we already used all numbers. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, (61 - (12 /4)) * something. 12/4=3. 61-3=58. Then 58* something. But what's left is 1. 58*1=58. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe (61 +12) * something. 61+12=73. Then 73 * (4 -1)=73*3=219. Then subtract something. But we already used all numbers.\n\nAlternatively, 61 * (12 -4) +1. 12-4=8. 61*8=488. 488+1=489. Nope.\n\nHmm. Maybe division. Let's see. 61 / (1/12) +4. That would be 61*12=732. 732 +4=736. Not helpful. Or 61/(1/(12-4)) which is 61/(1/8)=488. Still not.\n\nWait, perhaps (12 * (61 -4)) /1. So 12*57=684. 684/1=684. No. Not 183.\n\nAlternatively, 61 * 3 =183. Let me think again. How can I get 3 from 12,4,1. Maybe 12/(4*1). 12/4=3. Then 61*3=183. But then I used 61,12,4,1. Wait, yes! That's it. Because 12 divided by 4 is 3, multiplied by 61 gives 183. But wait, that uses all numbers: 12,4,61, and 1. Wait, but where does the 1 come into play? Oh, wait, if I do 12 divided by 4 times 61, that's 3*61=183. But then the 1 isn't used. So I need to incorporate the 1 somewhere else.\n\nWait, maybe there's a way to use the 1 in a way that doesn't change the value. Like multiplying by 1. So 61*(12/4)*1. That would use all numbers. Let's check: 12 divided by 4 is 3. 3 times 61 is 183, times 1 is still 183. Yes! So the equation would be 61 * (12 / 4) * 1. That uses all the numbers once, and the operations are division and multiplication. So the equation is 61*(12/4)*1=183. Alternatively, maybe parentheses can be arranged differently, but the key is that 12 divided by 4 is 3, then multiplied by 61 gives 183, and then multiplied by 1 doesn't change it. So that uses all four numbers. Perfect!\n\nSo the equation is 61 × (12 ÷ 4) × 1 = 183. Let me check again. 12 ÷4 is 3. 61×3=183. 183×1=183. Yep, that works. And all numbers are used once. So that should be the correct answer.\n</think>\n\n<answer>61 * (12 / 4) * 1</answer>"}]}

Each number must be used exactly once, and I can use basic operations. Hmm. Let me start by thinking about the larger numbers first because 581 is quite big. Maybe if I subtract or add something to 581 to get closer to 620. Let's see: 620 minus 581 is 39. So I need to make 39 from the remaining numbers 8, 5, and 26. Wait, but I have to use all four numbers. So maybe 581 plus something? Let's try 581 + (something with 8, 5, 26). Let's calculate 620 - 581 = 39. So I need to make 39 using 8, 5, 26. But how? Let's see: 26 + 8 +5 = 39. Oh, that's exactly 39! But wait, that uses all three numbers. So 581 + (26 + 8 +5) = 581 +39 = 620. But wait, does that use all the numbers? Yes: 581, 26, 8, 5. All used once. So that would work. Let me check: 26 +8 is 34, plus5 is 39. 581 +39 is 620. That seems correct. But wait, the problem says \"create an equation\" and allows using operations multiple times but each number once. So this would be 581 + 26 +8 +5 = 620. But wait, adding them all together. Let me check the sum: 581 +26 is 607, plus8 is 615, plus5 is 620. Yes, that adds up. So the equation is 581 + 26 +8 +5 = 620. But wait, the problem might require combining them with operations, but maybe that's acceptable. Let me verify. The instructions say \"using the numbers 581, 8, 5, 26\" and \"each number can only be used once, and you must use all the numbers\". So in this case, adding them all together uses each once, all operations are additions. So that's valid. But maybe there's another way. Let me see if there's another possible combination. For example, maybe using multiplication. If I take 26 multiplied by something. Let's see: 26*5 is 130. Then 8* something. 581 plus 26*5 would be 581 +130=711. Then subtract 8* something. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, 581 - (something) =620. Wait, that would require subtracting a negative number. Alternatively, maybe 8*5 is 40. Then 40 + 26=66. 581 +66=647, which is over. Alternatively, 26* (8+5) =26*13=338. Then 581 -338=243. Not helpful. Alternatively, 581 -26=555. Then 8*5=40. 555 +40=595, which is still less than 620. Hmm. Alternatively, 5*8=40. 40*26=1040. 1040 -581=459. Not helpful. Alternatively, 581 divided by something. 581/5 is like 116.2. Then maybe 26*8=208. 116.2 +208=324.2. Not helpful. Hmm. Maybe there's another approach. Let me think again. The first solution seems to work, but maybe the problem expects combining operations. But according to the rules, addition is allowed. So the equation 581 + 26 +8 +5=620 is correct. Let me check the arithmetic again: 581 +26=607. 607+8=615. 615+5=620. Yes. So that's correct. So the answer would be 581 + 26 +8 +5. But wait, the problem might require using at least one multiplication or division, but the instructions don't specify that. They just say \"basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /)\" can be used one or multiple times. So addition is allowed. Therefore, the solution is valid. However, sometimes these puzzles expect you to use a combination of operations. Let me check again if there's another way. Let's see: 26*5=130. 8*581=4648, which is way too big. 581 - (26*5) =581-130=451. Then 451 +8=459. No. Alternatively, 581 - (26-8) =581-18=563. 563 +5=568. No. Alternatively, 5*8=40. 26*40=1040. 1040 -581=459. Still no. Hmm. Alternatively, (26 +5) =31. 31*8=248. 581 -248=333. Not helpful. Alternatively, 26* (8-5)=26*3=78. 581 +78=659. No. Hmm. Maybe 581 - (8*5)=581-40=541. 541 +26=567. Still not. Alternatively, 581 divided by 5 is 116.2. 116.2 * (26 -8)=116.2*18=2091.6. Way too big. Alternatively, 8*(5+26)=8*31=248. 581 -248=333. Still not. Hmm. So it seems that the straightforward approach of adding all the numbers works. But let me just confirm once again. 581 +26=607. Then +8=615. Then +5=620. Yes. So the equation is 581 +26 +8 +5 =620. So that's the answer. But let me make sure there's no other way. Let me check if using subtraction or division could help. For example, 26* (8 +5) =26*13=338. Then 581 -338=243. Then 243 +8=251. No. Alternatively, 581 - (26 -8) =581-18=563. 563*5=2815. Then /8=351.875. Not helpful. Alternatively, 581/(5) =116.2. 116.2 +26=142.2. 142.2*8=1137.6. Minus 5=1132.6. Not helpful. Alternatively, 8*5=40. 40*26=1040. 1040 -581=459. No. Hmm. Alternatively, 26*8=208. 208 +5=213. 581 -213=368. Not helpful. It seems that the only way is to add them all. So the answer is 581 +26 +8 +5 =620. Let me check the rules again: each number used once, all numbers used. Yes. Operations are all additions. That's allowed. So I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\n<answer>581 + 26 + 8 + 5 = 620</answer>"}]}

The operations allowed are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Hmm, let's start by thinking about possible combinations.\n\nFirst, maybe I can look for pairs that can combine to get close to 77. Let's see. 76 is a big number, so maybe subtract something from it. If I do 76 minus something, what's left? But 76 minus something would need to equal 77, which would require subtracting a negative number, but I don't have negative numbers here. So maybe that's not the way.\n\nAlternatively, adding 76 and something else. But 76 plus another number would be way over 77. For example, 76 + 26 is 102, which is too big. So maybe not addition. How about division or multiplication?\n\nLet's see, 76 divided by something. If I divide 76 by 6, that's about 12.666, which isn't helpful. Maybe multiply 6 and another number. 6*26 is 156, which is way too big. Hmm.\n\nWait, 31 is close to 30. If I can get 30 and then add 47, but not sure. Let's see, maybe combine 26 and 6 first. 26 + 6 = 32. Then 32 plus 31 is 63. Then 63 plus 14 would get to 77, but I don't have a 14. Alternatively, 76 - (something). Wait, maybe 76 + (some combination of 26, 6, 31) but I need to use all numbers.\n\nWait, I must use all four numbers exactly once. So I have to include each of 26, 76, 6, 31 in the equation. Let's try different groupings.\n\nWhat if I take 76 and subtract some expression that equals -1, so 76 - (-1) = 77. But how to get -1 from the remaining numbers 26, 6, 31. Let's see: 26 - 27 = -1, but I don't have 27. Or 6 - 31 = -25. Not helpful. Maybe 31 - (26 + 6) = 31 - 32 = -1. Oh, that's possible. Then 76 - (31 - 26 - 6) would be 76 - (-1) = 77. Let's check that:\n\n76 - (31 - 26 - 6) = 76 - (31 - 32) = 76 - (-1) = 77. Yes! That works. So the equation would be 76 - (31 - 26 - 6) = 77.\n\nLet me verify the numbers: 76, 31, 26, 6 all used once each. The operations are subtraction and parentheses. That should satisfy all conditions. Let me double-check the arithmetic:\n\n31 - 26 - 6 = 31 - 26 is 5, then 5 -6 is -1. So 76 - (-1) = 76 +1 =77. Yes, correct. So that works. Let me see if there's another way, but this seems to fit. So the equation is 76 - (31 - 26 -6) =77. But the problem requires using all the numbers with operations. So the answer is (76 - (31 -26 -6)), which simplifies to 76 - (-1) =77.\n</think>\n\n<answer>76 - (31 - 26 - 6) = 77</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using the numbers 538, 21, 62, and 66, each exactly once, with basic arithmetic operations to get 513. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I'll note that 513 is less than 538, so maybe subtracting something from 538. Let me check: 538 minus what? If I subtract 25, that would be 513. But do I have numbers that can make 25? The other numbers are 21, 62, 66. Let me see. Maybe 66 divided by something. Wait, 66 divided by (something) equals 25? That might not work. 21 is close to 25. Alternatively, maybe 21 plus something. 21 + 4.5 is 25.5, but that's fractions. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe multiply some numbers to get a larger value and then subtract. Let's see. Let's think about combining the other numbers. 21 and 62: 21*62=1302. Then 1302 divided by 66 would be around 19.72. If I subtract that from 538, 538 - 19.72 ≈ 518.28. Close to 513, but not exact. Maybe another combination.\n\nWait, 66 minus 21 is 45. Then 62 minus 45 is 17. But 538 minus 17 is 521. Not 513. Hmm.\n\nWhat if I do 538 minus (62 + 21)? That's 538 - 83 = 455. Then maybe use 66 somehow. 455 + 66 is 521 again. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 538 minus 66 is 472. Then subtract (21 + 62) which is 83: 472 -83=389. No. Not close.\n\nMaybe instead of starting with 538, maybe use multiplication. 21* something. 21*24=504, which is close to 513. But how to get 24 from the other numbers? 66-62=4, then 4*6=24. But I don't have a 6. Wait, 66-62=4, then maybe 21*(66-62 + something). Wait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, 62* something. 62*8=496. 496 + 17=513. Where would 17 come from? 66-21=45. 45-28=17, but 28 isn't available. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe 66 divided by something. 66 divided by 21 is about 3.14. Then 62 - 3.14 is around 58.86. 538 - 58.86 is approximately 479.14. Not helpful.\n\nAnother approach: Let's think of 513 as 512 +1, which is 2^9 +1. Not sure if that helps. Alternatively, 513 is 19*27. Let's see if I can get 19 and 27 from the numbers. 66-62=4, 21-4=17. Not helpful. 21+62=83, 83-66=17. Still not.\n\nWait, 538 - (something) =513. So the difference is 25. So I need to make 25 from 21, 62, 66. How? Let's see: 66 - (62 -21) =66 -41=25. Yes! So 66 - (62 -21) =25. Then 538 -25=513. Let me check that:\n\n62 -21=41. Then 66 -41=25. Then 538-25=513. But wait, the numbers used here are 538, 62,21,66. Each is used once. Yes! So the equation would be 538 - (66 - (62 -21)) =513. Let's compute step by step:\n\n62-21=41\n\n66-41=25\n\n538-25=513. Perfect!\n\nSo that uses all numbers once. Let me make sure: 538, 62,21,66. Yes, all four numbers used once. The operations are subtraction and parentheses.

The target is 300, which is somewhere in the middle. Maybe I can use the larger numbers to get close to 300 and then adjust with the smaller ones. Alternatively, perhaps combining the smaller numbers first would help.\n\nLet me try some combinations. Let's start by considering subtracting the two large numbers. 858 minus 718 is 140. Then we have 65 and 95 left. If I add those two together, 65 + 95 equals 160. Then 140 + 160 is 300. Wait, that's 140 + 160 = 300. But does that use all the numbers correctly? Let me check:\n\n858 - 718 = 140\n\n65 + 95 = 160\n\nThen 140 + 160 = 300. But the problem requires using all four numbers in a single equation. So maybe I can combine these steps. The equation would be (858 - 718) + (65 + 95) = 300. Let me verify that:\n\n858 - 718 is 140. 65 + 95 is 160. Adding those gives 140 + 160 = 300. That works! And all four numbers are used once. Let me check if this meets all the conditions. Each number is used once, and all are used. The operations are subtraction and addition. So yes, that should work.\n\nWait, but let me make sure there's no restriction on the order or the way the operations are applied. The problem states that each number can be used once, and all must be used. So this equation seems to fit: (858 - 718) + (65 + 95) = 300. Let me compute each part again to confirm:\n\n858 - 718 = 140\n\n65 + 95 = 160\n\n140 + 160 = 300. Perfect. That adds up correctly. So that's a valid equation using all four numbers once with basic operations. I think that's the solution.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(858 - 718) + (65 + 95) = 300</answer>"}]}

Then, 73 minus 51 is 22. If I add those two results, 64 + 22 = 86, which is too high. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe combining addition and subtraction. Let's see: 81 + 73 = 154.

If I subtract something from 650, maybe I can get close. Let's see: 650 - 78 = 572. That's way too high. 650 - 50 = 600. Still too high. What if I subtract a combination? Like 650 - (78 + 61) = 650 - 139 = 511. Still not close. Alternatively, maybe multiply some numbers. For example, 78 * 50 is 3900, which is way too big. But if I divide that by something... 78 * 50 / 650 = (3900) / 650 = 6. Not helpful. \n\nWait, maybe I can use division with 650. Let's see. If I take 650 divided by 50, that's 13.

Let's check. 78 * 3 =234, but not helpful. 61*4=244. 50*5=250. Hmm. Maybe 78 +61=139. 139 +50=189. That's too low. 78*50=3900. 3900 divided by 61 is about 63.93.

Wait, 78 divided by 6 is 13. But I don't have a 6. Alternatively, 61 - 50 =11. Not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, 78 +50=128. Then 128 * something. 128*3=384.

But how to get 6 from the remaining numbers 78,50,650. Let's see. 78 divided by 13 is 6. 650 divided by 50 is 13. Oh! Wait, 650 divided by 50 is 13. Then 78 divided by 13 is 6. So 61 multiplied by (78 divided by (650 divided by 50)) equals 61 * (78 /13) =61*6=366. That works!\n\nLet me check that again. The operations would be: 650 divided by 50 is 13. Then 78 divided by 13 is 6. Then 61 multiplied by 6 is 366. So putting it all together: 61 * (78 / (650 / 50)) = 366. Let's verify the numbers are used once each. Yes: 61,78,650,50. All used once. And the operations are division and multiplication. That should work. Let me calculate step by step to make sure:\n\nFirst, 650 /50 =13.\n\nThen 78 /13=6.\n\nThen 61*6=366. Yep, that's correct. So the equation is 61 * (78 / (650 / 50)). Let me check if parentheses are correct. Yes, because you need to do the innermost division first, then the division of 78 by that result, then multiply by 61.

If I subtract, say, 15 from 83, that gives me 68. But 68 is one of the numbers I have, but I already used 83 and 15. Then I have 44 and 68 left. Wait, maybe that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, adding 83 and 15 gives 98. Then 98 minus something? But 44 and 68 left. 68 - 44 is 24. 98 -24 is 74, not 92. Not helpful.\n\nWhat if I add 68 and 44? That's 112. Then subtract 15 gives 97. Then subtract 83? 97 -83 is 14. No. Maybe 68 + 44 = 112, then 112 - (83 -15). 83-15 is 68, so 112 -68=44. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe multiply. 83 minus something multiplied by something. Let's see. 83 - (68 / something). If I divide 68 by 44, that's like 1.545... Not sure. Then 83 minus that is about 81.45. Not close.\n\nAlternatively, 83 + (68 / something). 68 divided by 15 is about 4.533. Adding that to 83 gives about 87.53. Not enough. Hmm.\n\nWhat if I use subtraction and division. Maybe 83 - (68 - (44 +15)). Let's calculate inside the parentheses first. 44 +15=59. Then 68 -59=9. So 83 -9=74. Not 92.\n\nWait, maybe combine the numbers in a different order. Let's try 44 + 68 = 112. Then 83 -15=68. Then 112 -68=44. Not helpful. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe 68 - (83 -44) = 68 -39=29. Then 29 +15=44. Still not 92.\n\nAlternatively, 44 * something. Let's see. If I multiply 44 by 2, that's 88. Then add 4 to get 92. But where would I get 2 and 4 from the other numbers? Not sure. Wait, maybe 44 * (15 - (83 -68)). Let's check: 83-68=15. Then 15 -15=0. So 44*0=0. Not helpful.\n\nHmm. Maybe division. Let's think: 68 divided by something. 68/15 is roughly 4.53. If I add that to 83, that's 87.53. Then add 44? No. Wait, but we have to use all numbers once. So maybe 83 + (68 / (something)) - something else. Let's see. Let's say 83 + (68/(44/15)). Let's compute 44 divided by 15 is approximately 2.933. Then 68 divided by that is around 23.19. 83 +23.19 is about 106.19. Then subtract the remaining number? Wait, but all numbers must be used once. So in this case, 44, 68, 15, 83 are all used. Because 44 is divided by 15, then 68 divided by that result, then added to 83. So that equation would be 83 + (68 / (44/15)) = 83 + (68 *15/44) = 83 + (1020/44) ≈ 83 +23.18≈106.18. Not 92. So that's not right.\n\nWait another approach. Maybe multiply two numbers and subtract others. Let's see. 83 * 1 =83. Then add 9 to get 92. Where would 9 come from? 15 - (68-44) =15-24=-9. Then 83 + (-9)=74. No. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 68 + 15=83. Then 83 + (44 - something). But 44 is left. Wait, but I already used 68, 15, 83. So 44 is left. So 83 +44=127. Doesn't help.\n\nWait, maybe 83 - (something) =92. That would require that something is negative, which isn't possible here. So that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 44 + 68=112. Then subtract something. 83 +15=98. 112 -98=14. Not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps using division and multiplication. Let's try 68 * (15 / (83 -44)). Let's compute denominator:83-44=39. 15/39 is approximately 0.3846. 68*0.3846≈26.15. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 44 * (83 -68) /15. Let's see: 83-68=15. 44*15=660. 660/15=44. So 44. Not 92.\n\nHmm. What if I do 83 + 15=98. Then 98 - (68 -44). 68-44=24. 98-24=74. No. Not 92.\n\nWait, maybe (68 + 44) - (83 -15). 68+44=112. 83-15=68. 112-68=44. Still no.\n\nAlternatively, (83 + 68) - (44 +15). 83+68=151. 44+15=59. 151-59=92. Oh! Wait, that works! Let me check that again. 83 +68 is 151. Then 44 +15 is 59. 151 minus 59 is indeed 92. And all numbers are used once. So the equation would be (83 + 68) - (44 +15) =92. Let me verify:\n\n83 +68=151\n\n44 +15=59\n\n151 -59=92. Yes! That works. So the equation is (83 + 68) - (44 +15) =92. So the answer is (83 + 68) - (44 +15).\n</think>\n\n<answer>(83 + 68) - (44 + 15) = 92</answer>"}]}

Not enough.\n\nAlternatively, maybe multiplication. 54 multiplied by something. 54*7 is 378. Wait, 54*7 = 378 exactly. But I don't have a 7 here. But maybe I can make 7 from the other numbers. Let's check the remaining numbers: 198, 70, 261. How can I get 7 from those? 70 divided by 10 is 7, but I don't have a 10. 261 divided by something. 261 divided by... 261/37.2857 is 7, but that's not helpful.

Maybe 198 divided by something. 198 divided by 54 is 3.666... Not helpful. Hmm. Alternatively, 261 - 198 = 63. Then 70 - 63 = 7. Oh! Wait: 70 - (261 - 198) = 70 - 63 = 7. Then, 54 * 7 = 378.

So the equation would be 54 * (70 - (261 - 198)) = 378. Let me verify all numbers are used once: 54, 70, 261, 198. Yep, all used. So that should work. Let me write that as the equation: 54 * (70 - (261 - 198)) = 378. Let me check the order of operations. The innermost parentheses first: 261 - 198 = 63. Then 70 - 63 = 7. Then 54*7 = 378. Correct.

And combine them with basic arithmetic operations to get 99. Each number can only be used once. Hmm. Let me start by trying different combinations.\n\nFirst, maybe I should look for numbers that can be multiplied or divided to get close to 99. Let's check the largest numbers here. 68 is the biggest, followed by 41, 36, and 26. If I multiply 68 by something, but 68*1.5 is 102, which is close. Wait, 68 + 31 would be 99. How can I get 31 from the other numbers? Let's see. The remaining numbers are 41, 26, and 36. Hmm, 41 - (36 - 26) = 41 - 10 = 31. That might work. So putting that together: 68 + (41 - (36 - 26)) = 68 + 31 = 99. Let me check that. 36 - 26 is 10, then 41 -10 is 31, then 68 +31 is 99. Yes! But wait, does that use all four numbers? Let's see: 68, 41, 36, 26. Yes, all are used once. So that's a possible equation: 68 + (41 - (36 - 26)) = 99. \n\nWait, but the order of operations might require parentheses. Let me write it out properly. So the equation would be 68 + 41 - (36 - 26). Let me compute that step by step. 36 -26 is 10, then 41 -10 is 31, then 68 +31 is 99. Correct. So that works. Alternatively, maybe another arrangement. Let me confirm if there are other possibilities. \n\nAlternatively, maybe using division or multiplication. For example, 41 + 26 + 68 - 36. Let's compute that: 41+26=67, 67+68=135, 135-36=99. Wait, that's a simpler equation. 41 + 26 + 68 - 36 = 99. Let me check: 41 +26 is 67, plus 68 is 135, minus 36 is 99. Yes! That uses all numbers once with addition and subtraction. That seems even better because it's simpler and doesn't require nested parentheses. So maybe that's the answer. \n\nWait, but the problem says \"create an equation that equals 99\" using all numbers once. So 41 +26 +68 -36 = 99. That works. Let me verify: 41+26=67; 67+68=135; 135-36=99. Yep. So that's a valid equation. But why didn't I think of that first? Probably because I overcomplicated it with the nested operations. So this straightforward equation is correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way using multiplication. Let me see. For example, 68 - (36 / (41 -26)). Wait, 41-26 is 15. Then 36 divided by 15 is 2.4. Then 68 -2.4 is 65.6. Not 99. Not helpful. How about (26 * 36) / (68 -41). Let's see: 68-41=27. 26*36=936. 936/27=34.666... Not 99. Not useful. \n\nHow about 41 * (26 + 68 -36)/something. Let's compute 26+68=94, 94-36=58. 41*58=2378. That's way too big. Not helpful. \n\nAnother idea: 68 + (36 - (41 -26)). Let's compute 41-26=15, 36-15=21, 68+21=89. Not 99. No. \n\nWait, going back to the first equation I thought of: 41 +26 +68 -36 =99. That's straightforward and uses all numbers once with basic operations. So that's probably the right answer. Let me double-check. 41+26=67, +68=135, -36=99. Yes. Perfect. So the equation is 41 + 26 + 68 - 36 = 99. But the order of operations requires that we add and subtract left to right, so parentheses might not be needed. But depending on how the equation is structured. Let me write it properly. Since addition and subtraction are left-associative, it's correct as written. So the equation is 41 + 26 + 68 - 36 = 99.

If I subtract something from 106 to get to 109, but 106 is already 3 less than 109. Wait, maybe I can combine 30 and 10 somehow.

Maybe 55/(10 something). Wait, maybe I can use 30 and 10 to make a fraction. For example, 30/10=3. Then maybe 55*3=165. Then subtract 51? 165-51=114. Close to 109, but 5 off.

I need to create an equation using all the numbers 951, 80, 3, 68 exactly once, and the result should be 305. Hmm. Let me start by thinking about how these numbers can combine.\n\nFirst, 305 is a relatively large number. The biggest number here is 951, so maybe I can subtract something from it to get close to 305. Let's try that. If I do 951 minus something, what would that something be? Let's calculate 951 - 305 = 646. So I need to make 646 using 80, 3, and 68. Wait, but 80 + 68 is 148, which is way too small. Maybe multiplication? Let's see: 80 * 3 is 240, plus 68 is 308. That's 240 + 68 = 308. Then 951 - 308 = 643, which is not 305. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 80 * 68 is a big number. 80*68 is 5440. Divided by something? If I take 5440 divided by 3, that's about 1813.333, which is way too big. Not useful here.\n\nWait, maybe instead of starting with 951, I can combine the smaller numbers. Let's see. 68 and 80. If I add them, 68 + 80 = 148. Then multiply by 3: 148 * 3 = 444. Then 951 minus 444 is 507. Not 305. Hmm. If I subtract instead: 80 - 68 = 12. Then 12 * 3 = 36. 951 - 36 = 915. No good.\n\nWhat if I use division? Like 80 divided by something. 80 / 3 is approximately 26.666. Then 26.666 + 68 = 94.666. 951 - 94.666 is around 856.333. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 68 divided by something. 68 / 3 ≈ 22.666. Then 80 + 22.666 ≈ 102.666. 951 - 102.666 ≈ 848.333. Still not.\n\nWait, maybe I need to use multiplication and subtraction in a different way. Let's think about 305. 305 is 300 + 5, but how to get that. Let's see, 80 * 3 is 240. 240 plus 68 is 308. Oh, that's close. 308 is 3 more than 305. So if I can subtract 3 from that sum. Wait, but 240 + 68 is 308, then 308 - 3 = 305. But then how do I arrange that. Let's check the numbers. If I use 80, 3, 68, and 3, but wait, the original numbers are 951, 80, 3, 68. So the 3 is already used once. So if I do (80 * 3) + 68 - 3, but that would require using the 3 twice, which isn't allowed. So that's a problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to get 305. Let's think again. Let's see, 305 is 5 * 61. But I don't have 61 here. Or maybe 305 = 610 / 2. Not sure. Alternatively, 305 = 340 - 35. Hmm.\n\nWait, let's try a different approach. Maybe combining 951 with division. For example, 951 divided by 3 is 317. That's already higher than 305. 317 minus something. 317 - 12 = 305. So 12 can be made from 80 and 68. 80 - 68 = 12. So putting it together: (951 / 3) - (80 - 68) = 317 - 12 = 305. Let's check if that works. The numbers used would be 951, 3, 80, 68. Each number used exactly once. Yes! That seems to work. So the equation is (951 / 3) - (80 - 68) = 305. Let me verify the calculation. 951 divided by 3 is indeed 317. 80 minus 68 is 12. 317 minus 12 is 305. Perfect. That uses all the numbers once. So the equation is (951 / 3) - (80 - 68) = 305.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(951 / 3) - (80 - 68) = 305</answer>"}]}

Alright, let's start by thinking about what operations might get me close to 252.\n\nFirst, 252 is a bit large, so maybe multiplication is involved. Let's see: 96 * 2.625 is 252. Wait, but how can I get 2.625 from the other numbers? The other numbers are 94, 77, 15. Maybe 77 divided by something? 77 divided by 15 is about 5.133, which isn't helpful. 94 divided by something? 94 divided by 15 is approximately 6.266. Hmm, not helpful. Alternatively, maybe subtract some numbers to get a smaller value. Let's think differently.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe combine two numbers first. For example, 96 and 94. If I subtract them, 96 - 94 = 2. Then maybe multiply that by 77 and 15 somehow. Wait, 2 * 77 = 154, then 154 * 15 = 2310, which is way too big. Not helpful. What if I add 96 and 94? 96 + 94 = 190. Then maybe subtract 77: 190 - 77 = 113. Then 113 + 15 = 128. Not near 252. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, multiply 96 by something. Let's see. If I do 96 * (something) = 252. Then that something would be 252 / 96 = 2.625. So can I make 2.625 using 94, 77, 15? Let's see: 77 divided by 15 is about 5.133. 94 divided by 77 is about 1.22. 94 divided by 15 is 6.266. Maybe subtract some? Like (94 - 77) = 17. 17 divided by 15 is about 1.133. Still not 2.625. Hmm. Maybe (77 - 15) = 62. Then 62/94 ≈ 0.659. Not helpful. Maybe 94 + 77 = 171. Then 171 - 15 = 156. 156 divided by something? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe 94 - 15 = 79. 79 + 77 = 156. Still not useful.\n\nWait, maybe using division and multiplication together. Let's see: Suppose I take 77 and 15. If I do 77 - 15 = 62. Then 62 * (something) = 252. 252 /62 ≈ 4.06. Maybe 96 / 94 is about 1.02, which isn't 4.06. Not helpful. Alternatively, 77 * 15 = 1155. Then 1155 / something. Let's see: 96 + 94 = 190. 1155 / 190 ≈6.08, which doesn't help.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe 96 * 15 = 1440. Then 1440 divided by something. Let's see, 94 and 77. 94 + 77 = 171. 1440 /171 ≈8.42. Not 252. Alternatively, 94 -77=17. 1440 /17≈84.7, which is not 252. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe combining 94 and 15. 94 -15=79. 79 * 77=6083. Then 6083 divided by 96 is about 63.36. Not helpful. Alternatively, 94 *15=1410. 1410 divided by something. 96 and 77. 1410 / (96+77)=1410/173≈8.15. Not helpful. 1410/(96-77)=1410/19≈74.21. Still no.\n\nWhat if I try to get 252 as a product of two numbers. 252 factors into 12*21, 14*18, 28*9, etc. Maybe if I can make 12 and 21 from the numbers. Let's see: 96 - 94=2. Then 2* something. 2*15=30. 30 +77=107. Not 21. Alternatively, 77 - (96/ something). Wait, using division. 96 divided by 15 is 6.4. 77 -6.4=70.6. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 94 and 77. 94 -77=17. Then 17 *15=255. 255 is close to 252. Maybe 255 - (96/x). If x is 3, then 255 -32=223. Not helpful. Wait, but how to get 3 from 96. 96 divided by 32 is 3, but 32 isn't available. Wait, we have to use all numbers. So maybe that's not the way.\n\nAnother idea: 15 multiplied by 16.8 is 252. Can I get 16.8 from the other numbers? 96, 94, 77. Let's see: 96 -94=2. 2*77=154. 154/15≈10.266. Not 16.8. Alternatively, 77 divided by (94/96). So 77/(94/96)=77*(96/94)=77*1.021≈78.7. Then 78.7*15=1180.5. Not 252.\n\nWait, maybe (96 * 15) - (94 +77). Let's compute: 96*15=1440. 94+77=171. 1440-171=1269. No, that's way over.\n\nAlternatively, (94 +77) =171. Then 171 +15=186. 186 +96=282. Close to 252 but 30 over. Maybe subtract something. Wait, but all numbers are used. Hmm.\n\nWhat if I do 77 * (94 -96). That would be 77*(-2)= -154. Then -154 +15= -139. Not helpful. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe using division to create fractions. For example, 96 divided by (94 -77) = 96/17≈5.647. Then multiply by 15: 5.647*15≈84.7. Not 252. Alternatively, (94 divided by something). 94/(15-77)=94/-62≈-1.516. Then multiply by 96: -145.5. Not helpful.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Let me try another approach. Let's list possible combinations. Since 252 is the target, maybe factor it. 252=2*126=3*84=4*63=6*42=7*36=9*28=12*21=14*18. Let's see if any of these factors can be formed with the numbers.\n\nLooking at 9*28: Can I get 9 and 28 from the numbers? 15-6=9. But where do I get 6? Or 94-85=9. Not sure. Alternatively, 77 divided by something. 77/8.555≈9. Not helpful.\n\nHow about 12*21: 12 and 21. 96 divided by 8 is 12, but 8 is not available. 94-82=12. 82 isn't there. 15-3=12. Again, 3 is missing. 77 divided by 6.416≈12. Not helpful. 21 could be 77 -56=21, but 56 isn't there. 15 +6=21. Still missing numbers.\n\nWhat about 14*18: 14 and 18. 94 divided by 6.714≈14. Not helpful. 77-63=14. 63 is not present. 15-1=14. No. 18 could be 15 +3. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 7*36. 7 from 77 divided by 11. But 36 is 94 -58. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe 252 is 96 + 94 + 77 -15. Let's calculate: 96+94=190, 190+77=267, 267-15=252. Wait, that works! Oh! Let me check. 96 +94 is 190, then +77 is 267, then minus 15 is 252. Yes! So the equation would be 96 +94 +77 -15 =252. But wait, all numbers are used once, and only basic operations. Yes! That seems to fit. Let me verify:\n\n96 +94 =190\n\n190 +77=267\n\n267 -15=252\n\nYes! So the equation is (96 +94 +77) -15 =252. But since we need to use all numbers exactly once and the operations are allowed, this works. Let me check if I can write that as an equation. Since addition and subtraction are left to right, parentheses may not be needed, but to group the additions first. So perhaps (96 +94 +77) -15 =252. But maybe without parentheses: 96 +94 +77 -15. Since addition and subtraction have the same precedence and are evaluated left to right, it would compute correctly. So yes, that's the equation.\n</think>\n\n<answer>96 + 94 + 77 - 15 = 252</answer>"}]}

Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I'll list out the numbers: 9, 85, 44, 47. The target is 97. Hmm. Let's see. Since 85 is a large number, maybe I can start by using that. If I subtract something from 85, maybe? Let's check: 85 minus something equals 97? That would require the something to be negative, which might not be straightforward. Alternatively, maybe adding 85 and another number. 85 + 9 is 94, which is close to 97. Then we need 3 more. But I have 44 and 47 left. How can I get 3 from 44 and 47? 47 - 44 = 3. So maybe 85 + 9 + (47 - 44) = 85 +9 +3= 97. Wait, let me check: 85 +9 = 94, then 94 +3=97. Yes, that works. But let me verify if all numbers are used once. 85,9,47,44. Yes, all used. So the equation would be 85 + 9 + (47 - 44) =97. Let me calculate that again: 47-44 is 3, then 85+9=94, 94+3=97. Exactly. So that works.\n\nWait, but let me see if there are other possible ways. Maybe using multiplication or division. For example, 44 divided by something? 44 divided by 4 is 11, but we don't have a 4. Alternatively, 47 - (44/ something). Hmm. But maybe that's more complicated. Let's see. If I take 44 and 9, maybe 44/ (something) to get a useful number. But 44 divided by 4 is 11, but 9 can't make 4. Alternatively, 44 * something. 44 * 2 is 88. But 88 plus 9 is 97, but then I have 85 and 47 left. Wait, 85 and 47. 85 -47=38. But 88+9=97, but how would that fit? Let me see. Maybe 44*2 +9=97, but where do I get the 2? Alternatively, 85 + (44/ (something)). If I can make 12 from 44 and 47 and 9, but that seems tricky. Alternatively, 47 + something. Let me try different combinations. \n\nWait, the first solution I had seems straightforward. Let me check again: 85 +9=94. Then 47-44=3. 94+3=97. All numbers used once. So that's valid. Therefore, the equation is (85 +9) + (47 -44) =97. Alternatively, written as 85 +9 +47 -44. But parentheses might not be needed there, but adding them for clarity. So maybe 85 + 9 + (47 - 44) =97. Let me compute again: 47-44 is 3. 85+9 is 94. 94+3 is 97. Correct. So that's the equation. \n\nAlternatively, maybe using multiplication. Let's think: 44 * 2 =88. 88 +9=97. But how to get 2 from 85 and 47. 85-47=38, which is not helpful. Or 47 - (85/ something). Wait, 85 divided by 9 is about 9.44, which isn't helpful. Maybe 47 - (85/5) but 5 isn't available. Alternatively, 44 * (something) plus another number. Hmm. Not sure. Alternatively, 85 - (44/ something) +47 +9. Let's see. 44 divided by 4 is 11. But we don't have a 4. 44 divided by something else. 44 divided by 9 is approximately 4.888. Not helpful. Maybe 47 + 44=91. 91 + something=97. 91 +6=97. Where do I get 6 from 85 and9? 85-9=76. Not helpful. Or 85/ something. 85 divided by 9 is around 9.44. Not 6. Alternatively, 9 - (85/ something). Not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, 85 +44=129. Then 129 - something=97. 129 -32=97. How to get 32 from 47 and9. 47 -15=32. How to get 15 from 9. 9+6=15. But I don't have another 6. Maybe 9 + (47 - something). Not sure. Hmm. Alternatively, 85 +44 - (47 -9)=85+44 -38=129-38=91. Not 97. \n\nAlternatively, 47* something. 47*2=94. 94 +3=97. 3 from 9- something. 9-6=3. But where's 6? 85 and44. 85-44=41. Not helpful. Alternatively, 47* (9 - (85/44)). Let me compute 85/44 is approximately 1.931. 9 -1.931 is approximately7.069. 47*7.069 is around 332. Not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, 44 +47=91. 91 + something=97. 6 needed. 85-9=76. Not helpful. So maybe the first idea is the best. So the equation is 85 +9 +47 -44=97. Which uses all numbers once. Let me verify the arithmetic again. 85+9=94. 47-44=3. 94+3=97. Yes, correct. So the equation is 85 +9 +47 -44=97. Alternatively, grouping as (85 +9) + (47 -44). But the parentheses aren't necessary, but they might make it clearer. So maybe (85 + 9) + (47 - 44) = 97. Or just 85 + 9 + 47 - 44 =97. Either way, all numbers are used once. \n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\n<answer>85 + 9 + 47 - 44 = 97</answer>"}]}

Each number can only be used once, and I can use basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I'll list out the numbers and think about possible combinations. The target is 75, which is a relatively small number compared to some of these, especially 624 and 223. So maybe I need to use division or subtraction to bring down the larger numbers.\n\nLet me start by looking at the largest number, 624. If I divide 624 by something, maybe I can get a smaller number. Let's see: 624 divided by 10 is 62.4. That's close to 75, but not quite. What if I subtract something from 624? If I subtract 624 - 223, that's 401. Still too big. Maybe 624 - 97 = 527. No, that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe multiplying some of the smaller numbers. Let's see 97 and 10. If I multiply 97 by 10, that's 970. Then subtract something? 970 - 624 = 346. Not helpful. Hmm.\n\nWait, 223 is another large number. Maybe combining 223 and 97. 223 minus 97 is 126. Then 126 plus 10 is 136. Still not 75. Maybe 223 divided by something. 223 divided by 10 is 22.3. Then 624 minus 22.3 is 601.7. Not helpful.\n\nLet me think about using division to reduce the larger numbers. For example, if I can divide 624 by a number to get close to 75. Let's see: 624 divided by 8.32 is 75. But I don't have 8.32. Maybe if I can make 8.32 from the other numbers. The numbers left are 223, 97, 10. Hmm, 223 divided by something. Let's see: 223 divided by 10 is 22.3. Then 22.3 minus 97 is negative, which might not help. Alternatively, 97 divided by 10 is 9.7. Then 223 minus 9.7 is 213.3. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 223 minus 97 is 126. Then 126 divided by something. 126 divided by 10 is 12.6. Then 624 divided by 12.6 is approximately 49.5. Still not 75.\n\nWait, maybe combining operations. Let's see: (624 - 223) = 401. Then 401 - 97 = 304. 304 / 10 = 30.4. No. Not helpful.\n\nAnother approach: use multiplication and division together. For example, 97 - 10 = 87. Then 223 - 87 = 136. 624 / 136 is approximately 4.59. Not close.\n\nAlternatively, 624 divided by (223 - 97) = 624 / 126 = 4.952... Hmm, not 75.\n\nWait, 223 divided by 97 is approximately 2.299. Then 624 divided by that would be around 271.5. Not helpful.\n\nLet me try starting with 10. Maybe 10 multiplied by something. 10 * 75 = 750. But I need to get to 75. So maybe 750 divided by something. Wait, but I can't use numbers more than once. So 10 is part of the equation.\n\nWait, maybe 97 - 10 = 87. Then 223 - 87 = 136. Then 624 divided by 136 is 4.588... Not useful.\n\nAlternatively, 97 + 10 = 107. 223 - 107 = 116. 624 / 116 ≈5.379. Still no.\n\nHmm. Maybe I need to use subtraction and division. Let's think: 624 divided by something minus another number equals 75. Let's say 624 / x - y =75. Then x and y have to be made from the remaining numbers 223, 97,10. But how?\n\nAlternatively, 624 - (something) =75. Then that something would be 624 -75=549. So maybe combine 223, 97,10 to get 549. How? 223 * 2 is 446. But I can't use numbers more than once. 223 + 97 =320. 320 +10=330. Not 549. 223 * (97 -10)= 223 *87=19,401. Way too big.\n\nHmm. That approach doesn't work. Let's try another angle. Maybe 75 can be achieved by 97 - (something). 97 -22=75. How to get 22 from the other numbers. 624, 223,10. 223 - (624/10)=223 -62.4=160.6. Not 22. 624 divided by 223 is approximately 2.798. Then 2.798 *10=27.98. 97 -27.98≈69. Close but not 75.\n\nAlternatively, 223 divided by 10 is 22.3. Then 97 -22.3=74.7, which is close to 75. But we have to use all numbers. So 97 - (223 /10)= approximately 74.7. Then we have 624 left. How to adjust that? Maybe 624 - (something)=74.7. But that seems forced. Alternatively, maybe combine it with another operation.\n\nWait, let's write this as (97 - (223 /10)) + (624 / something). But we need to use all numbers. Wait, 223 and 10 are used in (223/10), then 97 is used, and 624 is left. But how to involve 624? Maybe multiply? 624 * (something). Hmm, but then need to make sure the total is 75.\n\nAlternatively, maybe ((624 / something) - (223 -97)) =75. Let's see. Let's pick the denominator for 624. Suppose we do 624 divided by 10 is 62.4. Then 62.4 - (223 -97)=62.4 -126= -63.6. Not 75.\n\nIf 624 divided by 8 is 78. But 8 isn't one of our numbers. Wait, maybe 223 -97=126, and 126 divided by something. 126 /10=12.6. Then 624 /12.6≈49.5. No.\n\nAlternatively, 624 divided by (something) equals 75. Then that something is 624/75=8.32. How to make 8.32 from 223,97,10. Hmm. 97 divided by 10 is 9.7. Then 223 minus 9.7 is 213.3. Not 8.32. 223 divided by 97≈2.299. 10 minus that≈7.7. Not 8.32.\n\nThis seems tricky. Let me try another combination. Let's consider 223 - (97 +10)=223 -107=116. Then 624 -116=508. Not 75.\n\nWhat about (624 -223) =401. Then 401 divided by something. 401 /5=80.2. Not 75. 401 -97=304. 304/10=30.4. No.\n\nAlternatively, 97 *10=970. Then 970 -624=346. 346 -223=123. Not 75.\n\nHmm. Maybe using division with the larger numbers. 624 /223≈2.798. Then 2.798 *10≈27.98. Then 97 -27.98≈69. Close but not 75. If I could get exactly 22. So 97 -22=75. How to get 22 from 624,223,10. Let's see 223 - (624/10)=223 -62.4=160.6. Not helpful. 624/(223/10)=624/(22.3)=27.98. Then 97 -27.98≈69. Again, close.\n\nWait, maybe 223 - (97 * something)=75. Let's see: 223 - x=75 →x=148. How to make 148 from 624,10. 624 /10=62.4. Not 148. 624 -10=614. No. 10* something? 10*14.8=148. But how to get 14.8 from 624? Not possible.\n\nAnother angle: 10*75=750. So maybe 750 minus something. But we need to use the given numbers. Let's see: 624 +223=847. 847 -97=750. Then 750/10=75. Oh! Wait, let's check that. So 624 +223=847. Then 847 -97=750. Then 750 divided by 10 is 75. But that uses all numbers: 624,223,97,10. So the equation would be ((624 + 223) - 97) /10 =75. Let's calculate step by step:\n\n624 +223 = 847\n\n847 -97 =750\n\n750 /10 =75. Yes! That works.\n\nSo the equation is ((624 + 223) - 97) / 10 =75. All numbers are used once, and operations are +, -, /.\n\nLet me double-check: 624+223=847. 847-97=750. 750/10=75. Yep, perfect.\n</think>\n\n<answer>((624 + 223) - 97) / 10 = 75</answer>"}]}

Then subtract 57, that would be 158 - 57 = 101. Not enough. What if I add both 76s? 76 + 76 = 152. Then add 82: 152 + 82 = 234, which is way over. If I subtract 57 from that, 234 -57 = 177. Still too big.\n\nAlternatively, maybe multiply some numbers. Let's see. 76 * 2 is 152, but I don't have a 2. Wait, I have two 76s. If I do 76 divided by 76, that's 1. Then 82 + 57 + 1 = 140. Close, but not 139. Oh, but maybe 82 + 57 = 139. Then I need to use the two 76s in a way that cancels out. Wait, if I have 76 - 76 = 0, then 82 + 57 + 0 = 139. But that would require adding the two 76s as 76 - 76, but then all numbers are used. Let's check: 82 + 57 + (76 - 76) = 82 +57 +0=139. Yes! But wait, does that work? Each number is used once. Let's count: 82, 57, 76, 76. Yes, all used. The operations would be 76 -76 subtracted from 82 +57. Wait, but the equation would be (82 +57) + (76 -76) =139. So the equation is 82 +57 +76 -76 =139. That's valid. Let me check: 82 +57 is 139, then adding 76 and subtracting 76 cancels out. So the answer is 82 +57 +76 -76=139. But let me make sure that all numbers are used once. 82, 57, 76, and 76. Yes, all four numbers are used. That works. Alternatively, maybe another way. Let's see if there's another combination. For example, using division. Maybe 76 divided by something. If I take 76 divided by 57, that's approximately 1.333. Not sure. Or 82 -76 =6. Then 6 * something. But then I have 76 and 57 left. 6 *76=456. Then 456 -57=399. Nope. Not helpful. Another idea: 82 + (76 * something). Let's say 76 * (57 -76). Wait, 57-76 is -19. 76*-19= -1444. Then 82 + (-1444) is way off. Not good. How about 76 * 2 =152, but again, I don't have a 2. Maybe using division to get a multiplier. For example, 76 divided by 57 is around 1.333. Then 82 + 76 * (76/57). Let's compute 76/57 is about 1.333. 76*1.333≈101. Then 82 +101=183. Not 139. Hmm. Another approach: 82 -57=25. Then 25 +76 +76=177. No. Not helpful. Wait, maybe multiply 76 by 57. That's a huge number, probably too big. 76*57=4332. Then 4332 divided by 76 would be 57. But that would use 76 twice. Wait, but if I have (76*57)/76 =57. Then 82 +57=139. But that would use 76,57,76, and 82. So the equation would be 82 + (76*57)/76. Simplify: 82 +57=139. But here, the two 76s are used as (76*57)/76, which is 57. So the equation would be 82 + (76 × 57 ÷ 76) = 139. That works. Let me check: 76 ×57=4332, divided by76 is 57. Then 82+57=139. So that's another way. But which equation is more straightforward. The first idea was 82 +57 +76 -76=139, which is simple. The other is 82 + (76×57÷76)=139. Both use all numbers once. But the problem states that each number can be used once. In the first equation, the two 76s are used as 76 -76, so each 76 is used once. In the second equation, the two 76s are multiplied and divided, each used once. So both are acceptable. Which one is better? The first might be considered using addition and subtraction, the second multiplication and division. But the problem allows any operations. Either way, both equations are valid. But perhaps the first one is more straightforward. Let me check again. Are there other possibilities? Let's see, maybe using subtraction in another way. For example, 82 +76=158. Then subtract (76-57)=19. 158-19=139. So that would be 82 +76 - (76 -57)=139. Let's compute: 76-57=19. 82+76=158. 158-19=139. Yes. That works. Let me check if all numbers are used once: 82, 76, 76, 57. Yes. So the equation would be 82 +76 - (76 -57)=139. That's another valid equation. Which one to choose? Well, the problem says to create an equation, and any valid equation is acceptable. Let me check which one uses all numbers properly. The first one: 82 +57 +76 -76=139. Here, two 76s cancel each other. The second one: 82 +76 - (76 -57)=139. Which is the same as 82 +76 -76 +57=139, which simplifies to 82 +57=139. But when expanded, it's 82 +76 - (76 -57) =82 +76 -76 +57=82 +57=139. Both equations are correct. The third option is 82 + (76×57÷76)=139. All three equations are correct. But the problem might prefer using the numbers without canceling, but either way is acceptable. Let me see if the problem allows parentheses. The example shows (1 + 2)/3, so parentheses are allowed. So the equation 82 +76 - (76 -57) =139 is valid. Alternatively, 82 + (76×57)/76=139. Both are correct. Which one is more efficient? Let me check if the problem has any preference. The problem states that you can use the operations one or multiple times. Either way, as long as all numbers are used once. So both are acceptable. The first equation: 82 +57 +76 -76=139. The second: 82 +76 - (76 -57)=139. Third: 82 + (76 ×57 ÷76)=139. All are valid. Let me pick the second one because it groups the 76 and 57 in a subtraction, which might be considered more efficient. But the first one is also correct. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of multiplication or division, but the first equation uses only addition and subtraction. Since all are valid, I'll go with the first one as it's simpler. Wait, but the first equation might seem like it's just 82+57=139 and then adding and subtracting 76, which might feel like not using the numbers effectively. But according to the rules, it's allowed. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects a different structure. Let me check 82 +76 -76 +57. That's 82 +57=139. But the two 76s cancel each other. But according to the problem's instructions, as long as all numbers are used once and the operations are valid. So yes, that's acceptable. But maybe the problem expects using all numbers in a non-trivial way. Hmm. Alternatively, 76 divided by something. Let's see: 82 +76 - (76 / 57). Let's calculate that. 76/57 is approximately 1.333. 82 +76=158. 158 -1.333≈156.666. Not 139. Not helpful. Alternatively, 76 - (82 -57) =76 -25=51. Not helpful. How about (76 +57) - (82 -76). That's 133 -6=127. No. Alternatively, 76 * (82 -76) +57. 82-76=6. 76*6=456. 456+57=513. No. Not helpful. Hmm. Maybe 82 + (76 - (76 -57))? Let's compute: 76 - (76 -57)=57. Then 82 +57=139. That's the same as the previous equation. So that's 82 + (76 - (76 -57))=139. Which is the same as 82 +76 -76 +57. So yes. So perhaps the best way is to write it as 82 +76 - (76 -57)=139. Because that groups the numbers in a way that doesn't just cancel out. So I'll go with that equation. Let me verify again: 82 +76 =158. Then subtract (76 -57)=19. 158 -19=139. Yes. Correct. So the equation is 82 +76 - (76 -57) =139. All numbers used: 82, 76, 76, 57. Correct. So that's the answer.\n</think>\n\n<answer>82 + 76 - (76 - 57) = 139</answer>"}]}

Hmm, each number has to be used once, and I can only use basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division. Alright, let's start thinking.\n\nFirst, maybe I should look at the largest number here, which is 510. If I can use that in a way that gets me close to 678, then maybe the other numbers can adjust it to reach exactly 678. Let's see. 510 plus something... 678 minus 510 is 168. So if I can make 168 with the remaining numbers 20, 87, and 30. But I need to use all three. Hmm, 20, 87, 30. Let's see. What if I add them up? 20 + 87 + 30 is 137. That's not enough. 510 + 137 is 647, which is still short by 31. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe multiply some of them. 20 * 87 is 1740, that's way too big. 20 * 30 is 600, plus 87 is 687. But 510 plus 600 plus 87 is way over. Wait, no, we can't reuse numbers. Wait, if I use 20 * 30 = 600, then 510 + 600 is 1110, which is way over. Not helpful.\n\nWait, let's try a different approach. Maybe subtract some numbers. 510 is big. Suppose I do 510 + 87 = 597. Then I have 20 and 30 left. 597 + 20 + 30 = 647. Still 31 short. Not enough.\n\nAlternatively, 510 - 87 = 423. Then adding 20 and 30: 423 + 20 + 30 = 473. That's way too low. Not helpful.\n\nWhat if I multiply 87 and 30? 87 * 30 = 2610. Then 2610 divided by something. Wait, but 2610 is too big. Let's see. If I do 2610 / 20, that's 130.5. Not helpful. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 87 * (30 - 20) = 87 * 10 = 870. Then 870 - 510 = 360. Still not 678. Not close.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider combining operations. Let's see. 510 + (something). Let's think of 678 - 510 = 168. So I need to get 168 from 20, 87, 30. How?\n\nLooking at 20, 87, 30. Maybe 87 * 2 = 174, but I don't have a 2. Alternatively, 30 * 5.6 = 168, but that's using division. Wait, 168 divided by 30 is 5.6, which would need fractions, but maybe possible. Let's see: 87 - (20 / something). Wait, 20 divided by something. Let's try: 87 + 30 = 117. 117 + 20 = 137. Still not 168. Hmm.\n\nWait, 87 + 20 = 107. Then 107 * something. But 107 * 1.57... is 168. Not helpful. Alternatively, 30 * (something). Let's see, 30 * 5.6 is 168 again. Maybe 87 - (20 / something). Let's see, 20 divided by (30 / 87). Wait, 30/87 is 10/29. So 20 divided by (10/29) is 20 * (29/10) = 58. Then 87 - 58 is 29. 30 * 29 is 870. Hmm, not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 87 * 20 = 1740. Then 1740 divided by 30 is 58. Then 510 + 58 = 568. Not 678. Hmm.\n\nWait another angle. Maybe 510 + 87 = 597. Then 30 * 20 = 600. 600 + 597 = 1197. Way too much. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe subtract. 510 + 87 - 30 -20 = 547. Not enough. \n\nAlternatively, 510 - (something) = 678. But 510 is less than 678, so that's not possible. So addition is needed.\n\nWait, perhaps using multiplication and division. Let's see. Suppose I do 30 * 20 = 600. Then 600 + 87 = 687. Then 510 + 687 is 1197, but we can't reuse numbers. Wait, no, if we use 30*20=600, then 600 + 87 = 687, then 687 + (510 - ???). Wait, but we need to use all numbers once. So maybe 510 is separate. Wait, let me make this clear: All numbers must be used exactly once. So 510, 20, 87, 30 must each be used once. So the equation has to include all four numbers, each once.\n\nSo maybe 510 + (87 * 2) + something. But we don't have a 2. Alternatively, 510 + (30 * 20) + 87? Wait, 30*20 is 600. 510 + 600 = 1110, plus 87 is 1197. No. Alternatively, 30*20=600. 600 + 87 = 687. Then 510 - 687 is negative. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe 510 + (87 - 30) * 20. Let's compute that. 87 - 30 is 57. 57 * 20 is 1140. 510 + 1140 is 1650. Way too high.\n\nHmm. Maybe division? Let's try. Suppose 510 divided by something. 510 / (87 - 30) = 510 / 57 ≈8.947. Then multiply by 20: 8.947 * 20 ≈178.94. Not 678.\n\nAlternatively, (510 + 30) * (87 / 20). 510 +30=540. 87/20=4.35. 540*4.35=2349. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe 510 + 87 = 597, then 30 * 20 = 600. Then 600 - (something). But 597 + 600 is over. Alternatively, 600 - 597 = 3. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 510 - (30 * 20) = 510 - 600 = -90. Then -90 +87= -3. Not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps (510 - 30) * (87 - 20). Let's compute: 510-30=480. 87-20=67. 480*67=32,160. Way too big.\n\nHmm. Maybe using division to get a larger number. For example, 87 / (something). Let's see. 87 divided by a small number would make a big number. 87 / (30 - 20) = 87 /10=8.7. Then 510 *8.7=4437. Not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps 510 + (87 * (30 - 20)). That's 510 + (87 *10)=510+870=1380. No.\n\nAlternatively, 510 + 30=540. Then 540 * (87 -20)=540*67=36,180. No. Not helpful.\n\nHmm. Maybe 87 * 30 =2610. Then 2610 - 510=2100. Then 2100 /20=105. Not 678.\n\nWait, maybe 510 + 87 +30 +20=647. Still 31 short.\n\nAlternatively, 510* something. If I do 510*1.32≈678. But how to get 1.32 from 87,30,20. Let's see: (87 +30)/ (20) =117/20=5.85. Not 1.32. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe 510 + (87 * (30/20)). Let's calculate 30/20=1.5. 87*1.5=130.5. 510+130.5=640.5. Close to 640.5, but still 37.5 short. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 510 * (30/(20)). That's 510*(3/2)=765. Then 765 +87=852, which is over. 765 -87=678. Wait, that's 765 -87=678. Let me check. 510*(30/20) -87=?\n\nCompute step by step:\n\n30 divided by 20 is 1.5. 510*1.5=765. Then 765 -87=678. Yes! That works. But wait, let me check if all numbers are used once. The numbers used are 510, 30, 20, and 87. Yes, each once. So the equation would be (510 * (30 / 20)) - 87 = 678. Let me compute again to verify:\n\n30 / 20 = 1.5\n\n510 * 1.5 = 765\n\n765 - 87 = 678. Correct. So that's the equation. So the equation is (510 * (30 / 20)) - 87 = 678. Let me check if all numbers are used: 510, 30, 20, 87. Yes, all four. Each used once. Perfect. So that's the solution.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(510 * (30 / 20)) - 87 = 678</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using the numbers 334, 8, 1, and 359, each exactly once, with basic arithmetic operations, and the result should be 34. Hmm. Let's start by thinking about possible combinations.\n\nFirst, 34 is a relatively small number compared to the given numbers like 334 and 359. So maybe I need to subtract or divide the larger numbers to bring them down. Let's list the numbers: 334, 359, 8, 1. \n\nLet me consider subtraction first. If I subtract 334 from 359, that gives me 25. Then I have 8 and 1 left. Hmm, 25 plus 8 is 33, plus 1 is 34. Wait, that could work. So 359 - 334 = 25, then 25 + 8 + 1 = 34. But wait, do I have to use all four numbers in a single equation? Because the problem says to use all numbers once. So just adding 25 +8 +1 uses only three numbers. So that approach might not work unless I can combine them into a single equation.\n\nWait, maybe (359 - 334) + 8 + 1 = 34. Let's check that: 359-334 is 25, 25+8 is 33, 33+1 is 34. Yes. So that uses all numbers: 359, 334, 8, and 1. Each used once. The operations are subtraction and addition. So the equation would be (359 - 334) + 8 + 1. Let me calculate that again to confirm: 359 minus 334 is 25. Then 25 plus 8 is 33, then 33 plus 1 is 34. Perfect. That seems to work. \n\nBut wait, maybe there's another way. Let me check if there's a different combination, just to be sure. For example, using division or multiplication. Let's see. 334 divided by something... 334 divided by 8 is about 41.75, which is higher than 34. If I subtract 359 from that, it would be negative. Not helpful. Alternatively, maybe 359 divided by something. 359 divided by 10 is 35.9, which is close to 34, but I don't have 10. Wait, but I have 8 and 1. 8 +1 is 9. So 359 divided by 9 is about 39.888..., which isn't 34. Hmm.\n\nWhat if I use multiplication? Let's see. 8 times something. If I take 334 - 359 = -25. Then maybe combine that with 8 and 1. But that's a negative number, so maybe not. Alternatively, 334 - (359 - (8*1)). Let's compute that: 359 -8 is 351, then 334 -351 is -17. Not helpful.\n\nWait, another approach: 8 multiplied by something. For instance, 8*(something) =34. 34 divided by8 is 4.25. So if I can get 4.25 using the other numbers. The remaining numbers are 334, 359, and 1. How? 359 -334 is 25. 25 divided by something. 25/1 is 25. 25 + something. Not sure. Alternatively, 334 - 359 = -25. Then maybe (-25 + something)/ something. Not sure. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe combining 334 and 359 into a division. Let's say 334 / 359. That's less than 1. Then multiply by 8 or something. Not helpful. Alternatively, 359 divided by something. 359 / (8 +1) = 359/9 ≈39.888, which is more than 34. If I subtract 334 from that? 39.888 -334 would be negative. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe using subtraction and division. Let's think: 334 - (359 / (8 +1))? Let's compute that. 8+1=9, 359/9≈39.888, then 334 - 39.888≈294.111. Not 34. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, (334 - 359) / (8 +1). That's -25/9 ≈-2.777. No. Not 34.\n\nHmm. Let me go back to the first idea. Using 359 -334 =25, then adding 8 +1. That gives 25 +8 +1=34. So the equation is (359 -334) +8 +1. Let's check if all numbers are used once: 359, 334, 8, 1. Yes. And the operations are subtraction and additions. Each number used once. So that's valid.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"create an equation that equals 34\" using all the numbers. So maybe parentheses can be arranged differently, but the key is that all numbers are used. So (359 - 334) +8 +1 =34. That's correct.\n\nAlternatively, could there be a multiplication involved? Let's see. Suppose I need to do 8 * something. For example, 8 *4.25 =34. How to get 4.25 from 334, 359, and 1. Let's see. 334 -359 = -25. Then -25 +1 =-24. Then divide by something. Hmm. Not helpful. Alternatively, (359 -334 -1)/ something. 359-334=25, 25-1=24. 24 divided by something to get 4.25. But 24/5.647≈4.25. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (334 + 359) divided by something. 334+359=693. 693 divided by 20.382≈34. But where to get 20.382 from 8 and 1. 8*2.547… which we don't have. So that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, 8*(something) +1. Let's see. 8x +1=34. So x= (34-1)/8=33/8=4.125. So if I can get 4.125 using 334 and 359. Maybe 359 -334=25. 25 divided by something. 25/6≈4.166, but not exactly. Not helpful. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (359 - (334 /8 )) +1. Let's compute that: 334/8=41.75. 359 -41.75=317.25. 317.25 +1=318.25. Not 34. No.\n\nAlternatively, 334 divided by (8 -1) + something. 8-1=7. 334/7≈47.714. 47.714 +359=406.714. No.\n\nHmm. Maybe the first solution is the correct one. Let me verify again. 359-334=25. Then 25+8=33. 33+1=34. So the equation is (359 - 334) + 8 + 1 =34. All numbers used once. That works. I think that's the solution.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(359 - 334) + 8 + 1 = 34</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using all the numbers 11, 72, 70, and 36 exactly once, with basic operations (+, -, *, /) to get 23. Hmm, how do I approach this?\n\nFirst, maybe I should look at the target number, 23. It's a prime number, which might make it a bit tricky. Since we have to use all four numbers, I need to figure out how to combine them in a way that the operations result in 23. Let's list out the numbers: 11, 72, 70, 36. They're all different, and some are larger than others.\n\nLet me think about possible combinations. Maybe subtract some of the larger numbers to get a smaller number, then divide or add others. For example, 72 and 70 are close to each other; their difference is 2. If I subtract 70 from 72, I get 2. Then maybe use that with other numbers. But how would that help get to 23?\n\nAlternatively, maybe start with division. 72 divided by 36 is 2. That's a small number. Then, 70 divided by something? Wait, 70 divided by 35 is 2, but we don't have 35. Hmm.\n\nWait, 72 divided by 36 is 2. Then if I take 70 minus that 2, that's 68. Then 68 plus 11 is 79, which is way over. Not helpful. Alternatively, 70 divided by something. Let's see, 70 divided by (72 - 36). 72-36 is 36. 70/36 is about 1.944. Not helpful. Hmm.\n\nWhat if I try to make 23 by combining 11 and 12. Because 11 + 12 = 23. How can I get 12 from the other numbers? The remaining numbers are 72, 70, 36. Let's see. 72 - 70 = 2. Then 36 divided by something. Wait, 36 divided by 3 is 12, but where do I get 3? Maybe 72 - 70 + 1, but I don't have a 1. Alternatively, 72 / something. 72 divided by 6 is 12. How to get 6 from 70 and 36? 36 - 30 is 6, but 30 from where? Maybe 70 - (something). This seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, 36 - (72/ something). If 72 divided by 6 is 12, but again, getting 6 from 70 and 36. Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe use 70 and 36 first. 70 minus 36 is 34. Then subtract something else. 34 - 11 = 23. Then we have 72 left. Hmm, but how to incorporate 72. Because we have to use all numbers. So if I do 70 - 36 - 11 = 23, but then where does 72 come in? Maybe multiply or divide somewhere. For example, (70 - (72 / something)) - 11. Let's try 72 divided by 36 is 2. Then 70 - 2 = 68. 68 - 11 = 57. Not 23. Alternatively, 72 divided by (something else). Maybe 72 divided by 70 is approximately 1.028, which isn't helpful.\n\nAnother angle: maybe use multiplication. 11 multiplied by 2 is 22, which is close to 23. How to get 2? 72 divided by 36 is 2. So 11 * (72/36) = 22. Then add 1? But we need to use 70. Wait, 22 + 1 = 23, but how to get 1 from 70? Maybe 70 minus 69, but I don't have 69. Alternatively, 70 divided by 70 is 1, but we already used 72, 36, and 11. Wait, maybe:\n\n(11 * (72/36)) + (70/70) = 22 + 1 =23. But that uses 70 twice, which we can't do. So that's invalid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 70 - something =23. Then that something would be 47. How to get 47 from 11,72,36. 72 - 36 =36. 36 +11=47. So 70 - (72 -36 +11) =70 -47=23. Let's check that:\n\n70 - (72 -36 +11) =70 - (36 +11)=70 -47=23. Yes! Wait, but that uses 72, 36, 11 in the parentheses. Then 70 minus that. So all numbers are used once. Let me check:\n\n70 - 72 +36 -11. Wait, but that would be (70 -72) + (36 -11) = (-2) +25=23. Wait, but the way I wrote it before was 70 - (72 -36 +11). Which is 70 -47=23. But if you distribute the negative sign, it's 70 -72 +36 -11. So yes, that's the same as (70 -72) + (36 -11)= -2 +25=23. So the equation would be 70 -72 +36 -11=23. Let me compute that step by step:\n\n70 -72 = -2\n\n-2 +36 =34\n\n34 -11=23. Yes! So the equation is (70 -72) + (36 -11) =23. But the way to write it with all numbers used once and operations. Alternatively, you can write it as 70 -72 +36 -11=23. But the problem states that each number is used once, and all numbers are used. Let's check:\n\nNumbers used: 70,72,36,11. All four. Each once. Operations: -, +, -. So that's three operations. That's allowed. So this equation works. Let me verify again:\n\n70 -72 = -2\n\nThen -2 +36=34\n\n34 -11=23. Correct. So the equation is 70 -72 +36 -11 =23. But maybe using parentheses to group differently. For example, (70 +36) - (72 +11) =106 -83=23. Wait, that's another way. Let me check:\n\n70 +36 =106\n\n72 +11=83\n\n106 -83=23. Yes! So that's (70 +36) - (72 +11)=23. This uses all numbers once and the operations + and -, with two subtractions. Let me confirm:\n\nYes, 70+36 is 106, then 72+11 is 83. 106-83=23. That works. So this equation would be (70 + 36) - (72 + 11) =23. That's a valid equation using all numbers once with + and - operations. That's another possible solution. \n\nWait, but the problem says \"create an equation that equals 23. You can use basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) one or multiple times but each number can only be used once, and you must use all the numbers.\" So either of these solutions work. The second one is perhaps simpler. Let me check again:\n\n(70 +36) =106\n\n(72 +11)=83\n\n106 -83=23. Correct. So the equation is (70 + 36) - (72 + 11) =23. Alternatively, without parentheses, 70 +36 -72 -11=23. Let's compute:\n\n70 +36 =106\n\n106 -72=34\n\n34 -11=23. Correct. So that works as well. Either way, both expressions are valid. So this seems like the solution. \n\nAlternatively, there might be other solutions using multiplication or division, but this seems straightforward. Let me check if there's another way. For example, using division. Maybe 72 divided by 36 is 2, then 70 divided by 2 is 35. Then 35 -11=24. Close but not 23. Or 72 /36=2, 70 -2=68, 68 -11=57. No. \n\nHow about 70 - (72 / (36 -11)). Let's compute denominator:36-11=25. 72/25=2.88. 70-2.88≈67.12. Not 23. \n\nAlternatively, (70 -72) * (36 -11). That's (-2)*(25)= -50. Not 23. \n\nWhat if I do 11 + (72 -70) *36. So 72-70=2, 2*36=72, 11+72=83. Nope. \n\nAlternatively, 70 / (72 - something) + something. Let's see: 72 -36=36. 70/36 ≈1.944. Then 1.944 +11 + ... Not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, 11 * (70 - something). Let's say 70 - (72/36) =70-2=68. 11*68=748. Not helpful. \n\nAnother angle: Maybe 72 - (70 - (36 -11)). Let's compute innermost:36-11=25. 70-25=45. 72-45=27. Not 23. \n\nAlternatively, 72 - (70 -36) -11. 70-36=34. 72-34=38. 38-11=27. Still no. \n\nHmm. It seems like the earlier solution (70 +36) - (72 +11) =23 is the most straightforward. Let's verify one more time:\n\n70 +36 =106\n\n72 +11=83\n\n106 -83=23. Correct. So the equation is (70 +36) - (72 +11) =23. Alternatively, written as 70 +36 -72 -11 =23. Both are correct. \n\nAlternatively, if we need to use all operations, but the problem allows using operations one or multiple times. But since we used only + and -, that's acceptable. So this should be the answer.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(70 + 36) - (72 + 11) = 23</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using the numbers 89, 8, 86, and 86 exactly once each, with basic arithmetic operations, to equal 712. Hmm, 712 is a pretty big number. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, maybe I should consider multiplication because that can get big numbers quickly. Let's look at the numbers. I have two 86s. Maybe I can use them together. If I subtract them, that gives zero, which probably isn't helpful. If I add them, that's 172. Hmm, 172 times something. Let's see, 172 times 4 would be 688, which is close but not 712. Maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe multiply 86 by something else. Let's try 86 * 8. That's 688. Then 688 plus 89 would be 777, which is over. If I subtract 86 instead, 688 minus 86 is 602. Not helpful. Wait, 86 * 8 = 688. Then 688 + 89 - 86 would be 688 + (89-86) = 688 +3 = 691. Still not 712. Hmm.\n\nWait, 89 is a big number. If I multiply 89 by 8, that's 712. Oh! Wait, that's exactly the target number. So 89 * 8 = 712. But then I need to use both 86s. Oh, right, the problem requires using all four numbers. So I can't just do 89*8. I have to include both 86s somehow.\n\nHmm, maybe I can use the two 86s in a way that cancels them out or combines them into something that doesn't affect the 89*8. For example, 86 - 86 = 0, then adding that to 89*8 would still be 712. But does that work? Let me check: 89 * 8 + (86 - 86) = 712 + 0 = 712. But I have to use all numbers exactly once, so that should be allowed. Wait, but in the problem statement, it says \"using the numbers 89, 8, 86, 86\" and each number can only be used once. So using both 86s in (86 -86) is okay because each is used once. So that might work. So the equation would be 89 * 8 + (86 - 86) = 712. Let me check that:\n\n89 *8 is 712. Then 86 -86 is 0. So 712 +0 is 712. Yes. That seems to fit. But let me verify if the problem allows such operations. The user mentioned basic arithmetic operations: +, -, *, /, which includes subtraction. So yes, that should be acceptable.\n\nBut wait, sometimes people might consider that using two numbers to make zero as trivial, but according to the problem's rules, it's allowed. Let me confirm the problem statement again: \"each number can only be used once, and you must use all the numbers.\" So yes, using both 86s in (86 -86) is necessary, as we have to use all four numbers. So that's a valid solution.\n\nSo the equation is (89 × 8) + (86 - 86) = 712. Alternatively, maybe 89 × (8 + (86 -86)) would also work, but that would be 89 ×8, which again uses all numbers. Wait, no, if I do 89 × (8 + (86 -86)), that would be 89 × (8 + 0) = 89×8=712. But in that case, the numbers used are 89,8,86,86. Yes. So either way, that works.\n\nBut the problem might require the equation to not have unnecessary parentheses. Let me see. The user provided example is like (1 + 2)/3. So parentheses are allowed. So either way, both equations would work. Let me check both possibilities.\n\nFirst option: 89 * 8 + 86 - 86. Since addition and subtraction are left associative, that would be (89*8) +86 -86. So 712 +86=798, then minus 86 is 712. So that's valid. So writing it as 89*8 +86 -86 =712. This uses all four numbers once each. No parentheses needed, but perhaps adding parentheses for clarity. Alternatively, 89*8 + (86 -86). Either way is correct.\n\nSo the answer could be written as (89 * 8) + (86 - 86) = 712, or 89 * 8 + 86 - 86 =712. Both are correct, but the former uses parentheses, which is acceptable as per the example. So I think either is fine. But maybe the simplest way is to present it as (89 * 8) + (86 - 86). That way, it's clear that each number is used once.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way. Let me check if there's another combination. For example, using division. Suppose I do something with 86 divided by something. But 86 divided by something else... 86 divided by 8 is 10.75, which might not help. Let me see. 89 + 8 +86 +86 = 269, which is way too low. So addition alone won't work.\n\nWhat about multiplication and division. Let's see, maybe 86 * 8 = 688. Then 688 + (89 -86) = 688 +3=691. No. Or 86 * (8 + (89/86))? Let's calculate 89/86 is approximately 1.0349. Then 8 +1.0349=9.0349. 86*9.0349≈ 777, which is over. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, 89 * (8 + (86/86)) = 89*(8+1)=89*9=801. That's too high. 89*(8 +1)=801. Not helpful.\n\nWait, 86/86 is 1, so 8 +1=9. So that's 89*9=801. Not helpful. Alternatively, 89*(8 - (86/86))=89*(8-1)=89*7=623. No.\n\nAlternatively, (89 +86) * (86 -8). Let's see. 89+86=175. 86-8=78. 175*78=13650, which is way too big. Not helpful.\n\nHmm, perhaps subtraction. 89*8 is 712. Then using the two 86s as 86-86=0. That's the simplest way. So the equation would be 89*8 +86 -86=712. That seems to be the correct and only way given the numbers. Because any other combination either doesn't reach 712 or doesn't use all numbers.\n\nSo the answer is (89 * 8) + (86 - 86) = 712. Let me just verify once again:\n\n89 *8 = 712.\n\n86 -86 =0.\n\n712 +0 =712.\n\nYes, that works. All numbers are used once. The operations are valid. So that should be the correct equation.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(89 * 8) + (86 - 86) = 712</answer>"}]}

But then I have to use the other numbers: 26, 39, 3. Let's see.\n\nIf I use 66 multiplied by something, maybe 2. But how to get 2 from 26, 39, and 3. Wait, 26 divided by 13 is 2, but I don't have 13. Alternatively, 3 subtracted from 26 would be 23, which isn't helpful. Maybe 39 divided by something. 39 divided by 3 is 13. Oh, so 39/3 =13. Then if I can subtract 13 from 26, that would give 13. Wait, but 26 - (39/3) = 26 -13=13. Then 13 times something? Not sure. Alternatively, 66 * (something) =132. So if I can get 2 from the other numbers. Let's see. 26, 39, 3.

Let me start by thinking about how these numbers can combine to reach 320.\n\nFirst, 320 is a multiple of 80. Specifically, 80 times 4 is 320. Hmm, maybe I can use 80 as a base and see if the other numbers can be manipulated to get 4. Let's see: 80 * (something) = 320. That something would need to be 4. So how can I get 4 from 24, 11, and 66?\n\nAlternatively, maybe another approach. Let's look at the other numbers. 66 is a larger number; perhaps multiplying it with something. 66 * 5 is 330, which is close to 320, but that's 10 over. Hmm.\n\nWait, 24 and 11. Let me see: 24 - 11 = 13. Then 13 * something? Not sure. Or maybe 24 + 11 = 35. 35 * 66 would be way too big. 35 * 9.14 is 320, but that's not helpful here.\n\nWait, maybe combining 80 with 66 first. 80 + 66 = 146. 146 * 2.19 would be 320, but again, fractions complicate things. Alternatively, 80 - 66 = 14. Then 14 multiplied by something. 14 * 24 is 336. Close to 320, but 16 over. Then subtract 11? 336 -11=325. Still not 320. \n\nAlternatively, 80 divided by something. 80 / (something) = ... Let's see. If I divide 80 by 0.25, I get 320. But how to get 0.25 from 24,11,66. 0.25 is 1/4. So maybe 80 divided by (something) equals 320. Wait, no, 80 divided by (1/4) is 320, but I need to create (1/4) using 24, 11, 66. Hmm. Maybe (24 - 11) / 66? 13/66 is approximately 0.196, not 0.25. Hmm.\n\nWait another angle: 320 divided by 80 is 4. So if I can make 4 from 24, 11, 66. Let's see. 24 - (66 / 11) = 24 - 6 = 18. No. 66 / (24 - 11) = 66 /13 ≈5.07. Not 4. How about (66 - 24) / 11. That's 42 /11 ≈3.81. Close to 4, but not exactly. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe 24 * 11 = 264. Then 264 + 66 = 330. 330 - 80 = 250. Not 320. Alternatively, 24 * 11 =264. 264 +80=344. 344-66=278. Still not.\n\nWhat if I multiply 66 by 5? 66*5=330. But how to get 5? Maybe 80 - (24 + 11) =80 -35=45. 45 divided by 9=5. But I don't have 9. Alternatively, 24 - 11=13. 66 divided by 13 is approximately 5.07. So 66/(24-11)=5.07. Then 5.07 * 63.1 ≈320. Hmm, but that's not exact and uses decimals. Not allowed here.\n\nWait, perhaps subtract some numbers. 80 * (66 - (24 + 11)). Let's compute that: 66 - (24+11)=66-35=31. Then 80*31=2480. Way too big.\n\nAlternatively, (80 - 66) * (24 +11). That's 14 *35=490. Not helpful.\n\nHow about 66 * (24 - (80 /11 ))? Let's compute 80/11≈7.27. 24 -7.27≈16.73. 66*16.73≈1100. Again, way off.\n\nHmm, maybe division. Let's see, 80 * (66 / (24 - 11)) =80*(66/13)=80*5.07≈405.7. Not 320.\n\nWait, what if I take 80 * (24 - 11) - 66. 80*13=1040. 1040 -66=974. Not.\n\nAlternatively, 80 * 11 = 880. Then 880 - (66*24). 66*24=1584. 880-1584 is negative, so no.\n\nWait, 24 * 66 = 1584. Then 1584 divided by something. 1584 / 4.95=320. But how to get 4.95 from 80 and 11. 80 /11≈7.27. Not helpful.\n\nAnother approach: 66 - 24 =42. Then 42 * 80 =3360. Then 3360 /11≈305.45. Close to 320 but not quite.\n\nWait, maybe 80 * 4 =320. So how to get 4 from 66,24,11. Let's see: 66 -24=42. 42 -11=31. No. 24 / (66 -11) =24/55≈0.436. Not 4. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, (66 - (24 +11)) =66-35=31. Then 80 -31=49. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe 80 + 66 =146. 146 * 2.19≈320. But that's using fractions again. Alternatively, 146 * 2 =292. 292 +24=316. Close. Then +11=327. No.\n\nWhat if I use division with 80 and another number. Like 80/(something) * another =320. Let's think: 80/(x) * y =320. So (80y)/x=320. Which simplifies to y/x=4. So y=4x. So maybe find x and y from 24,11,66 such that y=4x. Let's see possible pairs: 24 and 66: 66=24*2.75. Not 4x. 11 and 44: but 44 isn't here. 11*4=44. 24/6=4. Wait, 24 divided by 6 is 4. So if x=6, then y=24. How can I get 6 from the remaining numbers, which would be 11 and 66. 66 divided by 11 is 6. So putting that together: x=66/11=6, y=24. Then (80 *24)/(66/11). Let's compute that: 80*24=1920. 66/11=6. 1920/6=320. Yes! That works.\n\nSo the equation would be (80 * 24) / (66 / 11) = 320. Let's check: 66 divided by 11 is 6. 80 multiplied by 24 is 1920. 1920 divided by 6 is indeed 320. And all numbers are used once: 80, 24, 66, 11. Perfect. So the equation is (80 * 24) / (66 / 11) = 320.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(80 * 24) / (66 / 11) = 320</answer>"}]}

Each number has to be used once, and I can only use basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division. Hmm, let's start by thinking about the target number, 214. It's a bit over 200, so maybe I need to combine some of the larger numbers here. The largest numbers I have are 75 and 60. If I add those together, that's 135. Then, adding 53 would bring it to 188. Then 26 would make it 214. Wait, let me check: 75 + 60 = 135, plus 53 is 188, plus 26 is 214. Wait, but that would be using all numbers with addition. But 75 + 60 + 53 + 26 equals 214? Let me add that up. 75 + 60 is 135. 135 +53 is 188. 188 +26 is 214. Oh! Wait, that works! So just adding them all together? But that seems too straightforward. Let me double-check. 75 + 60 is 135, 135 +53 is 188, 188 +26 is 214. Yes, that's correct. But wait, the problem says \"create an equation\" but perhaps I need to use different operations, but maybe addition is allowed. Let me check the problem statement again. It says you can use basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) one or multiple times but each number can only be used once, and you must use all the numbers. Oh, but if I use only addition, that's allowed. So maybe the answer is just 26 + 60 +53 +75. Let me calculate that again. 26 +60 is 86, 86+53 is 139, 139 +75 is 214. Yes, that adds up. So maybe the simplest solution is just adding all the numbers. But is there a trick here? The problem didn't say that you have to use different operations, so maybe that's acceptable. But wait, sometimes puzzles like this expect you to use a combination of operations. Let me see if adding all the numbers is allowed. The problem states that each number can be used once and all must be used, and operations can be used multiple times. Since addition is allowed multiple times, then yes. So the equation would be 26 + 60 + 53 + 75 = 214. Let me check once more: 26 +60 is 86, 86+53 is 139, 139+75 is 214. Yep, that works. So maybe that's the answer. But wait, the user might think this is too easy, but according to the problem's rules, it's allowed. Alternatively, perhaps I need to use other operations. Let me try another approach to confirm. Suppose I try to multiply some numbers to get closer. For example, 75 - 53 is 22. Then 22 * 60 is 1320. Then 1320 divided by 26 is approximately 50.77, which isn't helpful. Hmm. Or maybe 60 divided by something. 75 * 53 is 3975, which is way too big. Maybe 75 * 2 is 150, but I don't have a 2. Alternatively, 75 + (60 - 26) * something. Let's see: 60 -26 is 34. 34 * 5 is 170, but 75 + 170 is 245, which is over. Alternatively, 53 * 4 is 212, but I don't have a 4. Maybe 53 * (something). Wait, maybe 53 * 4 is 212, then add 2 to get 214. But how to get 4 and 2 from the remaining numbers? Let's see. The numbers are 26, 60, 75. If I take 60 - 26 = 34. Then 34 / 75 is less than 1. Not helpful. Alternatively, 75 - (60 / 26). That's 75 - approximately 2.307, which is about 72.69. Then adding 53 gives around 125.69, which isn't enough. Hmm. Another approach: 75 * 2 + 60 + something. But again, not sure. Alternatively, maybe 60 * 3 is 180, plus 34 (from 75 - 41) but not sure. Wait, maybe 26 * 5 = 130. Then 130 + 53 = 183, plus 75 -60 =15, so 183 +15=198. No. Alternatively, 75 - 53 =22, 22*10=220. Then subtract 6 (from 26 -20, but not sure). Alternatively, 26 * (60 / (75 -53)). Let's see: 75 -53=22. 60 /22 is approximately 2.727. 26 *2.727≈70.9, which is not 214. Hmm. Let's try combining operations. For example, 75 + 60 =135, 53 -26=27. Then 135 +27=162. Not enough. Alternatively, 75 * 3 =225, but 225 -11=214. How to get 11 from 60,53,26? 60 - (53 +26)= -19. Not helpful. Alternatively, 53 - (60/26)=53 -2.307≈50.69. 75 *2.807≈210.5. Close but not exact. Alternatively, 60 +26=86. 86 +53=139. 139 +75=214. Oh wait, that's the same as before. So that's adding all the numbers. So the equation is 26 + 60 +53 +75 =214. So maybe that's the correct answer. But why did the problem ask for using operations one or multiple times, implying that maybe just addition is allowed. Since addition is one of the allowed operations, and using it multiple times (three additions) is allowed. So perhaps that's the solution. Let me check again: 26 +60=86, 86+53=139, 139+75=214. Yep. So maybe that's the answer. The problem didn't exclude using all additions, so that's valid. So the equation is 26 + 60 +53 +75 =214.\n</think>\n\n<answer>26 + 60 + 53 + 75 = 214</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using the numbers 17, 32, 26, and 49 exactly once each, combining them with basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) to get 731. Hmm. Alright, first step is probably to think about the target number, 731, and see how these numbers can be manipulated to reach it. \n\nFirst, I should note that 731 is a relatively large number, so maybe multiplication will be involved here. Let's check the approximate sizes. The largest numbers we have are 49 and 32. Let me see: 49 multiplied by something. 49*15 is 735, which is very close to 731. That's only 4 less. Interesting. So if I can somehow get 15 from the remaining numbers (17, 32, 26), but wait, 49 is already used. Wait, but I have to use all four numbers. So 49 is part of the equation. \n\nWait, if 49*15 is 735, which is 4 more than 731. So maybe 49*15 - 4 = 731. But where would I get 15 and 4 from the remaining numbers? Let's see. The remaining numbers are 17, 32, 26. Let's think: 32 - 17 is 15. Oh! Then 49*(32 - 17) = 49*15 = 735. Then subtract 4. But 4 could come from 26? Hmm, 26 is left. Wait, 26 can be used. But how? Let's see. If I have 49*(32 -17) - (26 / something). Wait, but we need to use all numbers. So 17, 32, 26, 49 are all used. So 49*(32 -17) - (26 / something). Wait, but if I do 26 divided by something to get 4, then 26 / 6.5 =4, but 6.5 is not available. Alternatively, maybe 49*(32 -17) - 26 + something? Wait, 735 -26 = 709, which is less than 731. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 49*(32 -17) - (something). Wait, 735 -4=731. So how to get 4 from 26 and 17. Wait, 26 - 22=4. But 22 is 32 -10. Not sure. Alternatively, 26 - (17 + something). Hmm, maybe not. Wait, 26 / 17 is roughly 1.529, which isn't helpful. \n\nAlternatively, maybe instead of 49*(32 -17), perhaps another combination. Let's think of other operations. What if we multiply 32 and 26? 32*26=832. Then subtract something. 832 - 49=783. Then 783 -17=766. Not 731. Hmm. \n\nAnother approach: Let's see 731 divided by 49 is approximately 14.918. So maybe 49*14.918, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps adding 49 and 32 first. 49 +32=81. 81*9=729, which is close to 731. So 81*9 +2=731. But how to get 9 and 2 from 17 and 26. Hmm. 26 -17=9, so 81*(26 -17)=81*9=729. Then 729 +2=731. But where does 2 come from? We have used 49,32,26,17. Wait, all numbers would be used in that case, but 2 isn't part of the numbers. So that approach might not work. \n\nAlternatively, maybe (49 +17) * something. 49+17=66. 66*11=726, which is close. 726 +5=731. 11 could be from 32 -21, but 21 from where. Maybe not. \n\nWait, let's think differently. Let's try to use division to create larger numbers. For example, 26 divided by something. But 26/17 is about 1.529. 32/16=2, but 16 isn't there. \n\nWait, perhaps 32 * 26 = 832. Then 832 - (49 +17) = 832 -66=766. No. Not 731. \n\nWait, 49*17=833. Then 833 - (32* something). 32*3=96. 833 -96=737. Close. 737 -6=731. So 49*17 -32*3 -6=731. But where do we get 3 and 6 from the remaining numbers. 26 can be used. 26 divided by something. 26/ (something)=3? 26/8.666, which isn't available. Not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, 49*17=833. 833 - (32 + 26) = 833 -58=775. Still not. \n\nHmm. Let's try to break down 731. 731 divided by 17 is 43. So 17*43=731. So if we can get 43 from 32, 26, 49. Let's see. 32 + (49 -26)=32+23=55. Not 43. Alternatively, 49 - (32 -26)=49-6=43. Oh! 49 - (32 -26)=43. Then 17*43=731. So putting it all together: 17*(49 - (32 -26)). Let's check that. \n\nFirst, compute the inner parentheses: 32 -26=6. Then 49 -6=43. Then 17*43=731. Yes! That works. Let me verify all numbers are used once: 17, 49, 32, 26. All four numbers are used exactly once. The operations are subtraction inside the parentheses and multiplication. So the equation is 17 * (49 - (32 - 26)) = 731. That should be the correct answer.\n</think>\n\n<answer>17 * (49 - (32 - 26)) = 731</answer>"}]}

Let's see. Hmm, basic operations are allowed: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division. Let me start by thinking about possible combinations.\n\nFirst, maybe I can group some numbers together. Let's see, 141 is a big number, so maybe subtracting something from it. If I do 141 minus something to get close to 20. But 141 minus what? Let's see, 141 - 121 = 20. How can I get 121 from the remaining numbers 27, 33, 47. Wait, 47 plus 27 is 74, 74 plus 33 is 107. Not enough. Maybe multiply. 27 times 33 is 891, which is way too big. 27 times 47 is 1269, also too big. Maybe 47 times 3 is 141, but 3 isn't here. Wait, 27 divided by something? 27 divided by 3 is 9, but again, no 3 here. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe combine 141 with another number first. Like 141 divided by something. 141 divided by 47 is 3. Then 3 times something else. Let's see, 141 / 47 = 3. Then maybe 3 times 27 is 81. Then subtract 33? 81 - 33 = 48. Not 20. Or 3 times 33 is 99, then subtract 27? 99 - 27 =72. No. Maybe that's not the right path.\n\nWait, maybe subtract 141 and another number. Let's see, if I do 141 - (something) = 20, then the something would be 121. So can I make 121 from 27, 33, 47? Let's try. 47 times 2 is 94, plus 27 is 121. But where's the 2? Maybe 33 - 27 = 6, but not helpful. Wait, 33 + 47 = 80. 80 + 27 = 107. Not 121. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, 47 + 27 = 74. 74 + 33 = 107. Still not 121. Maybe multiply? 27 * 47 is 1269, way too big. 33 * 47 is 1551. No. What if we do (33 + 47) * something? 80 * 1.5 would be 120, but 1.5 isn't available. Hmm.\n\nAnother approach: Let's think about combining numbers in pairs. Let's see. Let's say I take 141 and 47 first. 141 divided by 47 is 3. Then maybe 3 times something. Let's use the 27 and 33. So 3 * (something with 27 and 33). For example, 33 - 27 = 6. Then 3 * 6 = 18. Not 20. Or 27 + 33 = 60. 3 * 60 = 180. Then 180 divided by something, but we've already used all numbers except maybe not. Wait, in this case, we used 141, 47, 27, 33. So that's all four numbers. Wait, but 141/47=3, then 3*(27+33)=3*60=180. That's using all numbers, but 180 isn't 20. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 141 minus something. Let's try 141 - (47 + 33) = 141 - 80 = 61. Then 61 minus 27 = 34. Not 20. Hmm. What if I do 141 - 47 - 33 -27 = 141 - 107 = 34. Same result.\n\nWhat if we do (141 - 47) divided by something. 141-47=94. 94 divided by (33 - 27)=6. 94/6 is about 15.666. Not 20. Close but no.\n\nWait, 33 - 27 =6. Then 47 -6=41. 141 divided by 41 is approximately 3.439. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 47 - (33 -27) =47 -6=41. Then 141 -41=100. 100 divided by something? But we already used all numbers. Wait, 141,47,33,27. If I do 141 - (47 - (33 -27)) = 141 - (47 -6) =141 -41=100. But that's 100. Not 20. How to get 20 from 100? Maybe divide by 5, but 5 isn't available. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe (141 - (47 + 33)) =141 -80=61. Then 61 -27=34. Still no. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, use division in a different way. Let's try 27 + 33 =60. Then 47 - something. 47 - (141 divided by something). Let's see. Suppose 141 divided by 60 is 2.35. 47 -2.35=44.65. Then 44.65 + something? Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (141 / (47 - something)). Let's see. 47 minus 27=20. Then 141 /20=7.05. Then 7.05 plus 33=40.05. Not 20.\n\nWait, maybe 33 - (141 / (47 -27)). 47-27=20. 141/20=7.05. Then 33-7.05=25.95. Close to 20 but not exactly.\n\nHmm. Maybe trying a different combination. Let's think about multiplying some numbers to get a larger value and then divide.\n\nFor example, 27 * 33 =891. Then 891 divided by 47 is approximately 18.957. Close to 19. Not 20. Then adding 141? Wait, but we have to use all numbers once.\n\nAlternatively, 141 divided by 47 is 3. Then 3 times (33 -27) =3*6=18. Still not 20.\n\nWait, 141 minus (47 + 33 +27) =141-107=34. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe 141 - (47 * 3). But 47*3=141, so 141 -141=0. But 3 isn't in the numbers. Unless we can get 3 from the other numbers. 27 divided by 9 is 3, but 9 isn't available. Alternatively, 33-27=6. Then 6/2=3. But 2 isn't available. So that's not possible.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe using subtraction and division. Like (141 - 27) / (47 - 33). Let's calculate. 141-27=114. 47-33=14. 114 divided by14 is approximately8.142. Not 20.\n\nWait, what if (141 - 33) divided by (47 -27). 141-33=108. 47-27=20. 108/20=5.4. Not 20.\n\nHmm. Let's try (47 + 33) * something. 47+33=80. 80 * something. 80 * (27 - (141/something)). Wait, getting complicated. Maybe 80 * (27 / (141 - something)). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, 141 - (47 * (33 -27)). Let's compute 33-27=6. 47*6=282. 141-282= -141. No.\n\nWait, maybe 27 + 33 =60. Then 60 divided by something. 60/3=20. But how to get 3 from 141 and47. 141 divided by47 is3. So then (27 +33)/(141/47)=60/3=20. Oh! Wait, that works! Let me check:\n\n(27 + 33) divided by (141 divided by47) =60 /3=20. And all numbers are used: 27,33,141,47. Each once. Yes!\n\nSo the equation would be (27 + 33) / (141 / 47) = 20. Let me verify:\n\n27 +33=60\n\n141 divided by47=3\n\n60 divided by3=20. Correct!\n\nYes, that works. So the equation is (27 + 33) / (141 / 47) =20.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(27 + 33) / (141 / 47) = 20</answer>"}]}

Oh right, the problem says all numbers must be used once. So that approach uses three numbers but leaves out 1. So that won't work.\n\nSo maybe I need to include the 1 somehow. Let's adjust the previous idea. If 40*7 -22 =258, but need to use 1. Maybe 40*(7 +1) -22=40*8 -22=320-22=298. Not 258. Alternatively, 40*(7-1) +22=40*6 +22=240+22=262. Close but not 258. Hmm. 262-4=258, but I don't have a 4. Alternatively, 40*(7) + (22 -1) =280+21=301. Nope.\n\nWhat if I do 22* something? 22*11=242. 242 +16=258. How to get 11 and 16? 40,7,1. Maybe (40 - (7+1))=32. 22*32=704. Not helpful. Or 22*(40/(7-1))=22*(40/6)=22*6.666≈146.666. No.\n\nWait, maybe using division. Let's see. 40 + 22=62. 62* something. 62*4.16=258. But how to get 4.16 from 7 and 1. Maybe (7-1)=6. 62*6=372. Too high. Alternatively, (7+1)=8. 62*8=496. Still not.\n\nAlternatively, 22* (40 - 7) +1. 22*33 +1=726 +1=727. No. Not even close.\n\nWait, maybe combine operations. Let's think of 258 as 258 = (40 * 6) + 18. How to get 6 and 18 from 22,7,1. Hmm. 22 - (7 +1)=14. 14 isn't helpful. 7-1=6. Then 40*6=240. Then 240 +22=262. Still not. But if I could subtract 4, but where?\n\nAlternatively, 40*( (22 / (7 -1)) ) + something. 7-1=6. 22/6≈3.666. 40*3.666≈146.666. Adding that to the remaining numbers? But the remaining numbers would be used already. Wait, maybe 40*(22 - (7 -1))=40*(22 -6)=40*16=640. No, way over.\n\nHmm. Let's try different combinations. Maybe subtract and multiply. For example, (40 -1) *7= 39*7=273. Then 273 -22=251. Close to 258 but 7 off. 251 +7=258, but I already used 7.\n\nWait, (40 - (7 -1)) *22. 40 -6=34. 34*22=748. Nope.\n\nAlternatively, (22 +7) * (40 -1)=29*39=1131. Way too big.\n\nHow about 22*(7 +1) +40=22*8 +40=176+40=216. Still low. 216 + something? But I have to use all numbers. Wait, 22*(7+1) +40*1=176 +40=216. Still same.\n\nWait, maybe 22* (40 - (7 +1))=22*(32)=704. No. 704 is too big.\n\nAnother approach: 258 divided by 40 is 6.45. Maybe 40*(6.45)=258. So how to get 6.45 from 22,7,1. Let's see: 22/(7 -1) = 22/6≈3.666. 7 -1=6. Then 22/6 + something? Not sure. Alternatively, (22 +7)/ (1) =29. 40*29=1160. No.\n\nWait, perhaps 40*7=280. Then 280 -22=258. But then where does the 1 come in? Since I have to use all numbers. So maybe 40*7 -22 +1=258 +1=259. Not helpful. Or 40*7 -22 -1=280-23=257. Close but no. So that approach doesn't work because the 1 is left over.\n\nWait, but maybe use 1 as part of the operations. Like 40*(7 - (1)) -22=40*6 -22=240-22=218. No. Not 258.\n\nAlternatively, 40*(7) + (22 -1)=280 +21=301. Not 258.\n\nHmm. Maybe division. 40/(1) + 22*7=40 +154=194. No.\n\nWait, 22* (40 - (7/1))=22*(40-7)=22*33=726. No.\n\nAlternatively, 22*( (40/7) +1). 40/7≈5.714. 5.714+1≈6.714. 22*6.714≈147.7. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe 40 + 22 =62. Then 62 * (7 -1)=62*6=372. Then 372 - something? But I've already used all numbers. So that's 62*6=372. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, (40 +22) *7 /1=62*7=434. No.\n\nWait, maybe 22*7=154. Then 40* (something) +154=258. So 40*x +154=258 → 40x=104 → x=2.6. How to get 2.6 from 1 and the remaining numbers. But remaining numbers would be 40 and 22 already used. Hmm, not possible.\n\nAnother angle: 258 is 43*6. So 43*6=258. How to get 43 from the numbers. Let's see: 40 + (22 / (7 -1)) =40 + (22/6)=≈43.666. Multiply that by (7-1)=6. So (40 +22/6)*6=40*6 +22=240+22=262. Close to 258. But that uses 40,22,7,1 (since 7-1=6). But the result is 262. Not 258. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (40 + (22 -7)) * (something). 40+15=55. 55 *4.69≈258. But how to get 4.69 from the remaining number 1. Not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps 40*(22 -7) +1=40*15 +1=600+1=601. No.\n\nAlternatively, 22* (40 - (7+1))=22*(32)=704. No.\n\nHmm, maybe subtract instead. Let's think: 40*7=280. 280 -22=258. But again, missing the 1. So maybe adjust to use 1 somehow. Like 40*(7 -1) +22=240 +22=262. No. Or 40*7 -22*1=280-22=258. Wait! That uses 40,7,22, and 1. Each exactly once. Let me check: 40 multiplied by 7 is 280. Then subtract 22 multiplied by 1, which is 22. 280-22=258. Yes! That works. So the equation is 40*7 -22*1=258. But I need to make sure that all numbers are used once. 40,7,22,1. Yes. So the equation would be (40 × 7) - (22 × 1) = 258. So written as 40*7 -22*1=258. Or using parentheses for clarity, maybe (40*7) - (22*1). But since multiplication is implied, maybe even just 40*7 -22*1. That should work.\n</think>\n\n<answer>40*7 - 22*1</answer>"}]}

Let's start by thinking about the target number, 84. Hmm, maybe if I can find combinations that get close to 84 first and then adjust.\n\nFirst, looking at the numbers given: there's a 5, two 71s, and an 89. The two 71s are the same, so maybe that could help in some way. Let's see. The largest number here is 89, so maybe subtracting something from 89 could get close to 84. If I subtract 5 from 89, that's 84. But then I have the two 71s left. Wait, but I need to use all the numbers. So that approach might not work directly. Because if I do 89 - 5 = 84, then I still have two 71s left that I haven't used. So that's a problem. So that idea won't work unless I can incorporate the 71s into the equation somehow.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe combine some numbers first. For example, if I add 71 and 71, that's 142. Then maybe subtract something. Let's see. 142 - 89 = 53. Then 53 + 5 = 58, which is not 84. Not helpful. Alternatively, 142 divided by something. 142 divided by 5 is 28.4, which isn't helpful. Hmm.\n\nWait, 89 minus 5 is 84. So if I can somehow use the 71s to make up the rest. Let's think. If I have 89 - 5 = 84, but I need to use the two 71s. Maybe use them in a division or multiplication that results in 1, so that when multiplied, it doesn't change the 84. But 71 divided by 71 is 1. So maybe 89 - 5 + (71 / 71). Let's check that: 89 -5 is 84, plus 1 is 85. Not 84. Close, but not quite. Alternatively, 89 - (5 + (71 /71)). Let's compute: 71/71 is 1, plus 5 is 6. So 89 -6 is 83. Still not 84. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (89 + 71) divided by something. 89 +71 is 160. 160 divided by 5 is 32. Not helpful. If I add both 71s: 89 +71 +71 =231, subtract 5 gives 226. No. Not close.\n\nWhat if I multiply? Let's see. 71 * 5 is 355. Then subtract 89 and 71: 355 -89=266, 266 -71=195. Nope. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 89 - (71 - (71 /5)). Let's compute that step by step. 71 divided by 5 is 14.2. Then 71 -14.2 is 56.8. Then 89 -56.8 is 32.2. Not 84.\n\nWait, maybe combine the two 71s first. 71 +71=142. Then 142 -89=53. Then 53 +5=58. Still no. How about 142 divided by something? 142 divided by (89 -5) is 142/84≈1.69. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 89 - (71 / (71 -5)). Let's compute denominator: 71-5=66. Then 71/66≈1.075. Then 89 -1.075≈87.925. Close to 84, but not quite. Hmm.\n\nAnother angle: Let's see if we can get 84 by multiplying some numbers. 84 is 12*7, but not sure. Alternatively, 84=14*6. Not sure if that helps. Alternatively, 84=90-6. Maybe use 89 and 5 to get 90, then subtract 6. But how to get 6 from the 71s? 71-71=0, not 6. 71 divided by 71=1. Then 5+1=6. Wait, that's possible. Let's try that. So 89 +5=94, then subtract (71/71). 71/71 is 1. So 94 -1=93. Not 84. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe 89 - (5 + (71/71)). That's 89 - (5 +1)=83. Close but not 84. Alternatively, 89 + (71/71) -5. That's 89 +1 -5=85. Still not 84.\n\nWhat if we do 71 +5=76. Then need 8 more to reach 84. How to get 8 from 89 and 71? 89 -71=18. Not 8. 89/71≈1.25. Not helpful. 71-89= -18. Hmm. Not useful.\n\nAlternatively, 89 - (71 / something). Let's see. If we divide 71 by 5, that's 14.2. Then 89 -14.2=74.8. Then add 71 to get 145.8. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe (89 -71) * something. 89-71=18. 18 *5=90. Then subtract 71? 90-71=19. Not 84.\n\nAlternatively, 18 * (71/71) =18. Then 18 +5=23. No.\n\nHmm. Maybe using division in a different way. Let's think. Suppose I take 89 and 71 and do something. Maybe 89 +71=160. Then 160 divided by 5=32. Then add the other 71: 32+71=103. Not 84.\n\nAlternatively, 89*5=445. Then subtract 71 and 71: 445-71=374, 374-71=303. Not 84.\n\nWait, maybe (89 * 5) - (71 +71)=445-142=303. Still not.\n\nAlternatively, 89 - (5 * something). For example, 5*14=70. 89-70=19. Not helpful. How to get 14 from 71 and 71? 71-71=0. Not helpful.\n\nAnother approach: Let's see what 84 can be expressed as. 84 is 84. Let's see: 71 +13=84. How to get 13 from 5, 71, 89. Maybe 89 -71=18, 18-5=13. So 71 + (89 -71 -5). Let's compute: 89-71=18, 18-5=13. Then 71 +13=84. But wait, this uses 71, 89, 71, and 5. Yes. All numbers are used once. Wait, but in this case, it's 71 + (89 -71 -5). Let me check: 89 -71=18, then 18 -5=13. Then 71 +13=84. So the equation would be 71 + (89 -71 -5) =84. Let me verify: 89-71 is 18, 18-5 is 13, 71+13=84. But in this case, we have used 71 twice. Wait, but the original numbers are 5,71,71,89. So the two 71s are allowed. Because each number can be used once, but since there are two 71s, we can use both. So this equation would be valid. Let's check: 71 (first one) + (89 -71 (second one) -5). So yes, both 71s are used, 89 and 5. So that works. So the equation is 71 + (89 -71 -5) =84. Which simplifies to 71 +13=84. Correct.\n\nWait, but does this satisfy the requirement of using each number once? Let's see. The numbers used are: 71, 89, 71, 5. So yes, each number is used once, and all are used. The two 71s are separate instances, so it's allowed. So that equation works. Therefore, the answer is 71 + (89 -71 -5) =84. Which can be written as 71 +89 -71 -5=84. Alternatively, (71 +89) -71 -5=84. But maybe using parentheses to group as (71 + (89 -71) -5). Wait, but that might not be necessary. Let me check the arithmetic. 89 -71 is 18, then 18 -5 is 13. Then 71 +13=84. So yes. So the equation would be 71 + (89 -71 -5) =84. Alternatively, 71 +89 -71 -5. The order of operations would handle that as (71 +89) -71 -5, but since addition and subtraction are left associative, it would compute as ((71 +89) -71) -5 = (160 -71) -5=89 -5=84. Wait, that's a different way. Wait, if you compute 71 +89 first, then subtract 71, then subtract 5. Let's see:\n\n71 +89 =160\n\n160 -71=89\n\n89 -5=84.\n\nYes. So that works. So the equation can be written as 71 +89 -71 -5=84. But since we need to use each number once, and this uses both 71s, 89, and 5, that's valid. So the equation is 71 +89 -71 -5 =84. That's a valid equation. So that's the answer.\n</think>\n\n<answer>71 + 89 - 71 - 5 = 84</answer>"}]}

Let's list the numbers: 4, 96, 72, 27. Target is 9. Let's think about factors or multiples that might lead to 9. For example, 27 divided by 3 is 9. But do I have a 3 here? Not directly. But maybe I can create a 3 using other numbers. Let's see.\n\nWait, 72 divided by 24 is 3. How can I get 24? 96 minus 72 is 24. Wait, 96 - 72 = 24. Then 24 could be used with 4? 24 divided by 4 is 6. Hmm, not sure. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 96 divided by something. 96 divided by 4 is 24. Then 27 minus 24 is 3. Then 72 divided by 3 is 24. Hmm, not helpful. Wait, but the target is 9. Let me think of possible combinations.\n\nAnother approach: maybe combine 27 and 72 first. 72 minus 27 is 45. Then 96 divided by something. 96 divided by 4 is 24. 45 and 24... 45 minus 24 is 21. Not helpful. Maybe 45 divided by 24 is 1.875. No.\n\nAlternatively, 72 divided by 27 is about 2.666, not helpful. Maybe 27 divided by something. 27 divided by 3 is 9. How to get a 3? 96, 4, 72. Let's see: 72 divided by 24 is 3. How to get 24 from 96 and 4? 96 divided by 4 is 24. So 72/(96/4) = 72/24 = 3. Then 27 divided by that 3 is 9. Oh, that's a possibility!\n\nSo putting it together: 27 divided by (72 divided by (96 divided by 4)). Let's check the order of operations. First, 96 divided by 4 is 24. Then 72 divided by 24 is 3. Then 27 divided by 3 is 9. Yes! So the equation would be 27 / (72 / (96 / 4)).\n\nWait, but let's make sure all numbers are used once: 96, 4, 72, 27. Yes, each is used once. So that works. Let me write that as (96 / 4) gives 24, then 72 / 24 is 3, then 27 /3 =9. So the equation is 27 / (72 / (96 / 4)) =9. That should work. Let me verify the calculation step by step.\n\nFirst: 96 /4 =24. Then 72 /24=3. Then 27 /3=9. Yep, exactly. So the equation is 27/(72/(96/4))=9. So in the required format, it's (27 / (72 / (96 / 4))). Let me check if there's any other way, but this seems to use all numbers once and reach 9.

Let's start by thinking about possible combinations.\n\nFirst, maybe I can look for pairs that can result in numbers that can then be combined further. For example, if two numbers can be multiplied or divided to get a smaller number, then maybe adding or subtracting with the others. Let's see.\n\nLooking at 86 and 15: 86 divided by 15 is about 5.73, which isn't an integer. 15 divided by 86 is less than 1. Maybe that's not helpful.

Not 6.\n\nWait, maybe I need to use division somewhere to get a smaller number. Let's think: 15 divided by 5 is 3. Then if I can get another 3 from 43 and 86, then 3 + 3 =6.

I need to use all the numbers 18, 18, 10, and 38 exactly once each with basic operations to make 380. Hmm. Let's start by thinking about what operations can get me to 380. Since 380 is a multiple of 10 and 38, maybe those can be part of the equation.\n\nFirst, 38 multiplied by 10 is 380. That's a good start. So if I can get 38*10, that's 380. But then I have to use both 18s. How can I incorporate the two 18s into the equation without changing the result? Maybe subtract and add them in a way that cancels out? Let's try.\n\nIf I do 38*10 + 18 - 18. That would be 380 + 0 = 380. But wait, that uses all numbers: 38, 10, 18, 18. But is subtraction and addition allowed here? The problem says each number is used once. So yes, 38*10 +18 -18 would technically use all numbers. Let me check: 38*10=380, then +18-18=0. So total is 380. But maybe that's considered valid. However, sometimes in these puzzles, they want all numbers to be part of the main operations, not just canceling each other out. Let me see if there's another way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe combine the 18s first. Like (18/18) which is 1. Then multiply by 38*10. So (18/18)*38*10 = 1*380 = 380. That uses all numbers: 18 divided by 18, then multiplied by 38 and 10. Wait, but does that use each number once? Yes: 18, 18, 38, 10. All used once. That could work. Let me write that down: (18 / 18) * 38 * 10 = 380. That seems valid.\n\nBut let me check if there are other possibilities. Maybe using subtraction or addition in a different way. For example, 38*10 is 380, and then maybe using the 18s as part of a division or something. Like 380 * (18/18) = 380*1 = 380. But that's similar to the previous idea. Alternatively, 38* (10 + (18-18)) = 38*10 =380. That uses all numbers: 10, 18, 18, 38. But again, the 18s cancel out. So that's 38*(10 + 0) = 380.\n\nHmm. So there are multiple ways, but the key is to use all numbers. Let me make sure the operations are allowed. For example, in (18/18)*38*10, that's valid. Each number used once, and operations are basic. So that's acceptable. Another way could be (38*10)*(18/18) = 380*1=380. That's the same as the first one but written differently. Alternatively, 38*10 + (18-18) =380 +0=380. \n\nBut I need to check whether the problem allows using numbers in such a way where they cancel each other. If the problem requires that each number contributes meaningfully, then maybe the division or subtraction approach is not preferred. But according to the problem statement, it just says each number can be used once and all must be used, with any basic operations. So both approaches are valid. However, the first one with division might be more efficient. Let me verify once again.\n\nWait, the problem says \"create an equation that equals 380\" using all the numbers once each. So the equation can be structured in different ways. Let's check the first idea: (18 / 18) * 38 * 10. Breaking it down: 18 divided by 18 is 1, multiplied by 38 is 38, multiplied by 10 is 380. So yes, that works. Alternatively, 38 * 10 * (18 / 18) is the same.\n\nAnother approach: Let's see if there's a way without using division. For example, 38*10 is 380. Then how to use the two 18s. Maybe 380 + 18 -18 =380. But that's the same as before. Alternatively, could I do something like (38 + 18) * something. 38+18=56. Not sure. 56 * something. 56*10=560, which is too much. What if 38 -18 =20, then 20 * (18 +10)=20*28=560. Still not 380. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, 18*10=180, then 180 + 38=218, which is too low. The other 18 is left. Not helpful. 18*38=684, then subtract 10 and 18? 684-10-18=656. Not 380. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe using multiplication and division in another way. Let's try 38 * (18 - (18/10)). Wait, let's compute that. 18/10=1.8. 18 -1.8=16.2. 38*16.2=616. That's not 380. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, (38 -18) * (18 +10). That's 20*28=560. Still not 380. Hmm.\n\nWhat if I do 18 * 18 = 324. Then 324 +38 +10= 372. Close but not 380.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, 18*10 + 38*18. Let's compute that. 180 + 684=864. No. Not 380.\n\nWait, maybe 38*10 + 18 +18. 380+36=416. No. Too high.\n\nAlternatively, 38*10 - 18 -18= 380-36=344. No. Not helpful.\n\nHmm. So far, the only ways that work are the ones where the 18s cancel each other out or divide to 1. Let me check again the first approach. (18/18) *38*10=380. Yes. That works and uses all numbers once. So that's a valid equation. So I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(18 / 18) * 38 * 10 = 380</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using the numbers 23, 8, 90, and 85, each exactly once, and combine them with basic arithmetic operations to get 189. Hmm. Let's start by thinking about the target number, 189. Maybe breaking it down into factors or seeing what operations could lead there.\n\nFirst, 189 is an odd number. Let's note that. The numbers given are 23, 8 (which is even), 90 (even), 85 (odd). Since 189 is odd, the result of the operations must be odd. That might help in determining which operations to use. For example, adding or subtracting two evens gives even, adding or subtracting two odds gives even, but adding an even and an odd gives odd. Multiplying even by anything gives even, etc. So the final step might involve combining an even and an odd number.\n\nWait, but we have two even numbers (8 and 90) and two odd numbers (23 and 85). So perhaps if I can combine the evens and odds in such a way to get an odd result. Let me think. Maybe subtract two evens to get an even, then add or subtract with an odd. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe multiply some numbers to get close.\n\nLet me try to find combinations. Let's see: 85 is a big number. If I subtract 23 from 85, that's 62. Then maybe add or multiply with others. But 62 + 8 = 70, then 70 + 90 = 160. Not enough. Alternatively, 85 - 23 = 62. 62 multiplied by something? 62 * 3 is 186, which is close. But how to get 3 from 8 and 90? 90 divided by something? Wait, 90 divided by 30 is 3, but I don't have 30. Alternatively, 90 divided by 8 is 11.25, which doesn't help. Hmm.\n\nAnother approach: 90 is a large number. Maybe use it in multiplication. Let's see. 90 times 2 is 180, which is close to 189. Then 189 - 180 = 9. So maybe 90*2 + 9. But how to get 2 and 9 from the remaining numbers. We have 23, 8, 85. Wait, 8 divided by something? 8/ (85-23) is 8/62, which is not helpful. Alternatively, 85 - 23 = 62. Then 62 minus 8 is 54. Not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps 85 plus 8 is 93. Then 93 minus 23 is 70. 70 multiplied by 90 is way too big. No. Alternatively, 85 divided by something? 85/23 is approximately 3.69. Then 3.69 times 90 is like 332, which is over.\n\nAlternatively, think of 189 as 23*8 + something. Let's calculate 23*8. 23*8 is 184. Then 184 plus 5 is 189. Where can I get 5 from the remaining numbers, which would be 90 and 85. But 90 - 85 is 5. So 23*8 + (90 - 85) = 184 +5 = 189. Wait, that uses all four numbers! Let me check: 23,8,90,85. So 23*8 uses 23 and 8. Then (90 -85) uses 90 and 85. Then adding them together. Yes! So the equation would be 23*8 + (90 -85) = 184 +5 = 189. That works. Let me verify:\n\n23*8 = 184\n\n90 -85 =5\n\n184 +5=189. Perfect!\n\nSo the equation is 23×8 + (90 -85) =189. All numbers used once, and all operations allowed. That should be the answer.\n</think>\n\n<answer>23 * 8 + (90 - 85) = 189</answer>"}]}

Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, let me think about the target number, 189. It's an odd number, which might be helpful. Since all the numbers except 29 are even or multiples of 41 (which is prime), maybe I need to combine them in a way that results in an odd number. Let me jot down possible combinations.\n\nStarting with the largest numbers first: 82 and 80. If I subtract them, 82 - 80 = 2. That's small. If I add them, 82 + 80 = 162. Hmm, 162 is still less than 189. Maybe multiplying? 82 * 80 is way too big (6560), so that's not helpful. Dividing them, 82/80 is about 1.025, which doesn't help much. Maybe combining with other numbers.\n\nNext, 41 and 29. 41 is a prime number, so it might be useful in multiplication or division. 41 + 29 = 70, which is even. 41 - 29 = 12, also even. 41*29 is 1189, which is way over. 41/29 is around 1.413. Not sure.\n\nSo perhaps I need to combine operations. Let's think, if I can get 162 from 82+80, then 189-162=27. So maybe adding 27? But I have 41 and 29 left. 41 - 29 = 12, which isn't 27. Or 29 -41 = -12. Not helpful. Alternatively, 41 +29=70, which if added to 162 would give 232, too much. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe multiply 41 and 29: 41*29=1189. Then subtract something. Let's see: 1189 - (82 +80) = 1189 -162=1027. Way too big. Not useful.\n\nWait, maybe using division. Suppose I do (82 + 80) + (41 - 29). That would be 162 +12=174. Still not 189. Or 162 + (41* something). If I multiply 41 by something. Wait, 41*4 would be 164, but how to get 4 from the remaining numbers? 29 can't be used again. Wait, I have to use all numbers once. So maybe the operations need to be structured differently.\n\nLet me try different groupings. What if I do 82 * (something) to get close to 189. 82*2=164. 189-164=25. So maybe 82*2 +25=189. How to get 2 and 25 from 41,80,29? Hmm, 80/40=2, but 40 isn't here. Wait, 80- (41-29)=80-12=68. Not helpful. Alternatively, 41 - (80/ something). 80 divided by 29 is about 2.758... Maybe not. Hmm.\n\nAnother angle: 189 divided by 41 is approximately 4.609. Maybe 41*4.609=189. But how to get 4.609 from 82,80,29. Not sure. Alternatively, 41*4 + something. 41*4=164, then add 25. Again, need 25 from 82,80,29. Wait, 80 - (82-29)=80-53=27. Close, but not 25. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe 80 - (82/ something). 82 divided by 29 is roughly 2.827. 80 -2.827=77.173. Then 41*77.173 is way too big. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, subtract 82 from 80 to get -2, then multiply by 41: (-2)*41= -82. Then add 29: -82 +29= -53. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe 41*5=205. 205 -16=189. How to get 5 and 16 from 82,80,29. Hmm. 80/16=5. So 41*(80/16) - (82-29). Wait, but 16 isn't a number here. Alternatively, 82 -29=53. 53- something=16. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, 80 - (82 -41)=80-41=39. Then 39* something. 39*5=195. Close to 189. Then subtract 6. But how to get 5 and 6. Maybe 29 - (something). Not sure.\n\nThis is tricky. Let's try another approach. Let's list possible operations:\n\nWe need to use all four numbers: 82,41,80,29.\n\nPossible operations: Maybe two operations, combining three numbers first and then the fourth. For example, (a op b) op c) op d. But with parentheses, there are multiple possibilities.\n\nAlternatively, think of combining two pairs: (a op b) op (c op d). Let's see.\n\nLet's try (82 +80) + (41 +29) = 162 +70=232. Too big.\n\n(82 +80) - (41 +29)=162 -70=92. No.\n\n(82*80) is way too big, as before.\n\n(82 -80) * (41 +29)=2*70=140. Not enough.\n\n(82 -80) * (41 -29)=2*12=24. Still not.\n\n(82 +41) * (80 -29). Let's see: 123 *51=6273. Way too big.\n\n(82 -41) * (80 -29)=41*51=2091. Nope.\n\nWhat about division? For example, (82*41)/(80-29). Let's compute that. 82*41=3362. 80-29=51. 3362/51≈65.92. Not 189.\n\nAlternatively, (80*41)/(82-29). 80*41=3280. 82-29=53. 3280/53≈61.886. No.\n\nHow about (41*29) - (82 +80)=1189 -162=1027. No.\n\nWait, 41*5=205. 205 -16=189. If I can get 5 and 16 from 82,80,29. But 80/16=5, but 16 isn't available. Alternatively, 82 -66=16. How to get 66 from 80 and 29? 80-14=66. 29-15=14. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 29 - (82 -80)=29 -2=27. Then 41* something=189. 189/41≈4.609. So 27 divided by something? 27 / (80/ something). Not sure.\n\nAnother idea: 189 = 80*2 +29. But 80*2=160, 160+29=189. So can I get 2 from 82 and41? 82/41=2. Yes! So 80*(82/41) +29. Let's check: 82 divided by41 is2, 80*2=160, 160+29=189. Perfect! But wait, does this use all numbers? 82,41,80,29. Yes, all four. Let me verify the equation:\n\n80 * (82 /41) +29 = 80*2 +29=160 +29=189. Exactly. That works. So the equation is 80*(82/41) +29. But need to make sure operations are allowed and each number is used once. Yes, 82 divided by41, then multiplied by80, then add29. All numbers used once. Perfect.\n</think>\n\n<answer>80 * (82 / 41) + 29</answer>"}]}

Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should consider the basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Since 294 is a relatively large number, maybe multiplication will be necessary. Let me check the target number. 294 is even, so maybe if I can get close to it with multiplication and then adjust with addition or subtraction.\n\nLet me try multiplying some of the larger numbers first. For example, 65 and 79 are the two largest numbers. If I multiply them, 65*79 is way too big (5135), which is way over 294. Maybe subtract something? But that seems too big. How about 62 and 79? 62*79 is 4898, still way too high. Hmm. So maybe multiplying two of the larger numbers isn't the way to go.\n\nAlternatively, maybe combining numbers through addition first and then multiplying. Let's see. For example, 65 + 62 = 127. Then if I multiply by something. 127 * 2.31 is roughly 294, but I need integers. Wait, but I need to use all four numbers, each once. So maybe I need to pair two numbers in a multiplication and then combine with the others through addition or subtraction.\n\nWait, maybe another approach. Let's see the total sum of all numbers: 65 + 62 + 79 + 57 = 263. That's less than 294. So to reach 294, we need to have some multiplication involved to increase the total.\n\nAlternatively, maybe subtract a smaller number from a product. Let's try. Let's see if 79 and 57 can be used. 79 - 57 is 22. Not helpful. Maybe multiply them: 79*57=4503, way too big. Not helpful. Hmm.\n\nWhat about 65 and 57? 65*57=3705. No. Maybe 62*57=3534. Still too big. Maybe 65*62=4030. Still too big. All two-number multiplications are giving numbers way above 294. So perhaps combining three numbers in some way.\n\nWait, maybe (a + b) * c - d or something. Let's think. Let's suppose (65 + 62) = 127. Then multiply by something. If I do 127 * 2.31, which is approximately 294, but 2.31 isn't an integer. Alternatively, perhaps (65 + 62) * (79 - 57). Let me check that. 65+62=127, 79-57=22. 127*22=2794. That's way over. Hmm.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe divide a product by a number. For example, (65 * 79) / something. 65*79=5135. If I divide by 17, that's about 302, but 17 isn't one of our numbers. Alternatively, maybe (62 * 57) = 3534. Divided by 12 is 294.5, but 12 isn't in our numbers. Hmm.\n\nWait, 62 * 57 = 3534. 3534 - 65 -79 = 3534 - 144 = 3390. No. Not helpful. Alternatively, 3534 divided by 12 is 294.5. Hmm. Not precise. Maybe use division with other numbers.\n\nWhat if I take 79 and 57. 79 - 57 = 22. Then 65 + 62 = 127. 127 * 22 = 2794. Still too high. Alternatively, 79 + 57 = 136. 65 + 62 = 127. 136 * 127 is way too big. Maybe subtract them: 136 - 127 = 9. Not helpful.\n\nWait, let me try combining three numbers. Suppose I do 65 * (62 - (79 - 57)). Let's compute inside the parentheses first: 79 -57 =22. Then 62 -22=40. 65*40=2600. No, that's too high. Not 294.\n\nAlternatively, 79 - (57 + 62) =79 - 119= -40. Then 65 * (-40)= -2600. No. Not helpful.\n\nHmm. Maybe using division. Let's see. 79 divided by something. 79 is a prime number. Maybe 65 - (79 / (62 -57)). Let's compute denominator:62 -57=5. 79/5=15.8. Then 65 -15.8=49.2. No. Not 294.\n\nWait, maybe (65 + 79) * (62 -57). Let's see: 65+79=144. 62-57=5. 144*5=720. That's more than 294. Maybe subtract something else. But we've used all four numbers here. Wait, 144*5=720. How can we get 294 from 720? If we subtract 426, but we don't have that number. Wait, but we have already used all four numbers, so maybe that's not the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, 62*57=3534. If we subtract 65*79=5135, but that would be negative. 3534 -5135= -1601. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe (79 + 57) * (62 - 65). 79+57=136. 62-65= -3. 136*-3= -408. No. Not 294.\n\nHmm. Let's think differently. Maybe 294 divided by one of the numbers. 294/57≈5.157. 294/62≈4.741. 294/65≈4.523. 294/79≈3.721. Maybe we can use one of these as a multiplier. For example, if we can get 294 by multiplying 65 by approximately 4.523. But how? Since we have to use other numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 62*4.741=294. But 4.741 is approximately 294/62. Not helpful. Alternatively, 79*3.721=294. Again, not exact. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe using subtraction. Let's see, 79*4=316. 316-22=294. Where can I get 22? 65- (62-57)=65-5=60. Not 22. Alternatively, 62-57=5. 79*5=395. 395 - 65=330. Not 294.\n\nWait, 57*5=285. 285 +9=294. How to get 9? 65 -62=3. 3*3=9. But that would require using 65,62, and then 3, but we don't have a 3. Alternatively, 79 -70=9, but that's not helpful.\n\nWait, 57*5=285. To get 294, need +9. Maybe (65 + (79 -62)) =65+17=82. 82 -57=25. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 79 -62=17. 57 +17=74. 74* something? 74*4=296. Close to 294. Then 74*4 -2=294. But how to get 4 and 2. Not helpful.\n\nWait, let's try another angle. 294 can be broken down into 300 -6. How can I make 300 and subtract 6? 65 + 62=127. 79 +57=136. 127 +136=263. Not 300. Alternatively, 62*5=310. 310-16=294. But 5 isn't available.\n\nAlternatively, 65*4.5=292.5. Close. But again, fractions. Maybe 65*4 + 57=260+57=317. No.\n\nWait, maybe 57*5.157=294. But 5.157 is 294/57=5.157. But how to get that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe ((65 * 62) - 79) /57. Let's compute 65*62=4030. 4030-79=3951. 3951/57=69.315. Not 294.\n\nHmm. Maybe a different combination. Let's try (79 + 57) * (62 / 65). 79+57=136. 62/65≈0.953. 136*0.953≈129.6. Not close.\n\nWait, perhaps (79 -57) * (65 - 62). That's 22 * 3=66. No.\n\nWait, another approach. Let's see, 294 is equal to 42 *7. Hmm, but how to get 42 and 7 from the numbers. 57-15=42. 15 is 65-50. But this seems too convoluted.\n\nAlternatively, 62 +57=119. 79 -65=14. 119 +14=133. Not 294.\n\nWait, maybe (79 + 62) * (57 / (65 - something)). Not sure. Let me think.\n\nWait, perhaps (65 * 62) - (79 * 57). Let's compute 65*62=4030. 79*57=4503. 4030-4503= -473. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 79*65=5135. 62*57=3534. 5135 -3534=1601. Not helpful.\n\nHmm. Maybe using division and multiplication together. For example, (79 - 57) * (65 - 62). As before, 22 *3=66. Not 294. Alternatively, (79 + 57) * (65 - 62) =136*3=408. Close but not 294.\n\nWait, 408 - (something)=294. 408-114=294. How to get 114? 62*1.838. Not helpful. But we don't have any numbers left. So maybe that's not the way.\n\nAlternatively, 79*3=237. 237 +57=294. But where do I get the 3? 65-62=3. So 79*(65-62) +57. Let's check: 65-62=3. 79*3=237. 237+57=294. Yes! That uses all numbers: 79, 65,62 (used in 65-62), and 57. Each used once. Wait, let me verify:\n\n79 * (65 - 62) +57 = 79*(3) +57 = 237 +57=294. Yes! That works. So the equation would be 79*(65 -62) +57 =294. Let's check if all numbers are used once: 79,65,62,57. Yes. Each used exactly once. Operations are subtraction, multiplication, and addition. So that should be the correct answer.\n</think>\n\n<answer>79 * (65 - 62) + 57 = 294</answer>"}]}

I need to make an equation using all the numbers 68, 16, 22, and 31 exactly once, and the result has to be 253. The operations allowed are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Hmm, let's start by thinking about the target number, 253. What's 253 close to? Well, 250 is a round number, so maybe I can get close to that and adjust. \n\nFirst, I should check if there's a way to combine these numbers through multiplication because that could get me to a higher number quickly. Let's see. The largest numbers here are 68 and 31. If I multiply those two together, 68*31 is... let's calculate that. 60*30=1800, 60*1=60, 8*30=240, 8*1=8. So 1800+60+240+8=2108. That's way too big. So maybe multiplying those isn't the way to go.\n\nWhat about adding some of the larger numbers? 68 + 31 is 99. Then maybe multiply that by something. If I take 99 and multiply by, say, 22 divided by 16. Wait, 22/16 is 1.375. 99*1.375 is 136.125. Not close. Alternatively, maybe 99 plus 22 is 121, then multiply by 16/31. That seems messy. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe subtract some numbers. Let's think. If I take 68 and subtract 16, that's 52. Then 31 minus 22 is 9. 52 multiplied by 9 is 468. That's over. Hmm. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe division can help reduce numbers. For example, if I divide 68 by 16, that's 4.25. Then multiply by 31? 4.25 *31 is 131.75. Then add 22, that's 153.75. Still too low.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 31 divided by 16 is about 1.9375. Multiply by 68: 1.9375*68. Let's see: 1*68=68, 0.9375*68=63.75. Total is 131.75. Then add 22: 153.75 again. Same result.\n\nWhat if I try combining two numbers through multiplication and then adding or subtracting others. For example, 22*16=352. Then 352 plus 68 is 420, plus 31 is 451. Too big. Or 352 - 68=284. Then 284 -31=253. Wait, wait! Wait, 22*16 is 352. Then 352 minus 68 is 284. Then 284 minus 31 is 253. Oh! That works! Let me check again:\n\n22 multiplied by 16 is 352. Then subtract 68: 352-68=284. Then subtract 31: 284-31=253. Yes! That uses all the numbers: 22, 16, 68, 31. Each used once, and the operations are multiplication, subtraction, subtraction. So the equation would be 22*16 - 68 -31 = 253. Let me verify the calculation:\n\n22*16: 22*10=220, 22*6=132, so 220+132=352. 352 -68 is 284. 284-31 is indeed 253. Perfect! So that's the equation.\n</think>\n\n<answer>22*16 - 68 - 31 = 253</answer>"}]}

Let me start by thinking about what operations could get me to a large number like 896 since 98 is already a big number here.\n\nFirst, maybe multiplying some of the numbers. Let's see, 98 times 8 is 784. Then, 784 plus another 8 would be 792. Hmm, that's not enough. Wait, 784 times something else? But I only have 7 left. 784 times 7 is way too big—like 5488. That's not helpful. So maybe that's not the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, what if I multiply 98 by 7? 98*7 is 686. Then I have two 8s left. How can I get from 686 to 896 using 8 and 8? 896 minus 686 is 210. So I need to get 210 from 8 and 8. But 8*8 is 64, which is too small. 8+8=16, which is even smaller. 8/8=1. Doesn't help. Maybe subtract: 8-8=0. No. So that might not work.\n\nWait, maybe I should use division or subtraction somewhere. Let's think differently. 896 divided by 98 is approximately 9.142. Hmm, not sure if that helps. Let me see: 98 * something equals 896. Let's calculate 896 ÷ 98. 98*9=882, 98*9.142... = 896. So 896 is 98 multiplied by 9.142857... which is 64/7. Wait, 64 is 8*8. So maybe 98 multiplied by (8*8)/7. Let's check: 8*8=64, 64 divided by 7 is approximately 9.142857, then 98* that is 896. So the equation would be 98 * (8 * 8) / 7. Let's verify that. First, 8*8=64. Then 64 divided by 7 is about 9.142857. Multiply by 98: 9.142857 *98. Let's compute: 9*98=882, 0.142857*98 is approximately 14, so total is 882+14=896. Exactly. So that works. So 98 multiplied by (8 times 8) divided by 7. All numbers used once, and operations are multiplication and division. So the equation would be (98 × (8 × 8)) ÷ 7. Let me check again: 8×8=64, 64×98=6272, then 6272 ÷7= 6272/7= 896. Yes, that's correct. So that's the equation.\n</think>\n\n<answer>98 * (8 * 8) / 7</answer>"}]}

Each number can be used only once, and I have to use all of them. The result should be 723. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should note that 723 isn't a number that immediately stands out in terms of factors. Let me check if 723 is divisible by any of the given numbers. Let's see: 723 divided by 17. 17*42 is 714, which leaves 9, so that's not a whole number. Divided by 57: 57*12 is 684, 57*13 is 741, so no. Divided by 36: 36*20 is 720, so 723-720 is 3, so 36*20 +3=723, but that would require using 36 and 3, which I don't have. Hmm. Divided by 799: that's way too big. So maybe combining operations.\n\nLet me think about the numbers I have. The largest number here is 799. Maybe subtracting something from 799 to get close to 723. 799 - something equals 723. Let's calculate: 799 - 723 = 76. So if I can get 76 from the remaining numbers (17, 57, 36), that would work. But 17, 57, 36. Let's see: 57 + 17 = 74. 57 + 36 =93. 36 +17=53. Not 76. 57 -17=40. 57-36=21. 36-17=19. Not helpful. How about multiplying? 17*4.25=72.25. Hmm. 57*1.333 is 76. But I need exact numbers. Wait, maybe combining operations. For example, 57 + (36 -17) =57+19=76. Oh! That would work. So 799 - (57 + (36 -17)) = 799 - (57+19) =799-76=723. Let me check the numbers: 799, 57, 36, 17. All used once. So that's 799 - (57 + 36 -17). Wait, but 36-17 is 19, then +57 gives 76. Then subtract that from 799. Yes. So the equation would be 799 - (57 + (36 -17)) =723. Let me verify the calculation step by step. 36-17=19. 57+19=76. 799-76=723. Correct. So that uses all four numbers: 799, 57, 36, 17. Each once. Operations used are subtraction and addition. So the equation is 799 - 57 - 36 +17. Wait, because 799 - (57 + (36 -17)) is equivalent to 799 -57 -36 +17. Let me check that: 799 -57 is 742. 742 -36 is 706. 706 +17 is 723. Yes, same result. But the parentheses might be necessary for clarity. Alternatively, writing it as 799 -57 - (36 -17). Let me confirm: 36-17=19, so 799-57=742, then 742-19=723. Correct. Either way, the equation uses all numbers once. So the equation would be 799 - 57 - (36 - 17) =723. Alternatively, 799 - (57 +36 -17)=723. Both are valid. The problem allows using operations multiple times, and as long as each number is used once. So this should work. Let me just check again if there's another possible combination, but this seems to fit. Let me think if there's another way. Maybe using multiplication or division. For example, 17 * 57 is 969, which is larger than 723. 17*42=714, but that's not helpful. 36*20=720, but again, 3 left. Maybe 36*20 +3, but 3 is not available. Alternatively, 57*12=684, then 684 + something. 684 +39=723. 39 can be made from 17 and 36. 36 +17=53, not 39. 36 + (something). 57-17=40. 40 + something? Not sure. Alternatively, 799 divided by something. 799/17 is about 47. So that's not helpful. Hmm. Alternatively, 57*(17) = 969, then subtract 36*7=252. 969-252=717, which is close but not 723. Not helpful. Alternatively, 57*12.5=712.5, but again, not helpful. So maybe the first approach is the correct one. Let me make sure I didn't miss any other combinations. What if I take 17 and 36: 17*36=612. Then 612 + something. 723-612=111. So need to get 111 from 799 and 57. Hmm, 799-57=742. Not 111. 57*2=114, which is close. 57*1.947=111. Not useful. Alternatively, 799/57≈14. So 14*57=798, which is close to 799. 799-57=742. 742 + something? Not helpful. Another angle: 36*20=720, so 720 +3. But how to get 3 from 17, 799, 57. Maybe (799 -57)/17. Let's compute: 799-57=742. 742/17=43.647, not 3. Alternatively, 57-36=21. 21-17=4. Not 3. So that might not work. So going back to the original idea, the equation 799 -57 - (36 -17) =723 seems to work. Let me write it properly with parentheses. It's 799 -57 -36 +17. But to group them, maybe (799 -57) - (36 -17). Which is the same as 799 -57 -36 +17. So yes, that equals 723. So the equation is (799 - 57) - (36 - 17) = 723. Alternatively, 799 - (57 + 36 - 17) =723. Either way, the equation uses all numbers once. Therefore, the answer should be (799 - 57) - (36 - 17) =723. But the problem requires the equation in a single line with proper operations. Let me check the arithmetic again. 799 -57 is 742. Then 36-17 is 19. 742 -19 is 723. Yes. So the equation is 799 -57 - (36 -17) =723. So in the required format, that would be written as <answer>799 - 57 - (36 - 17) = 723</answer>.\n</think>\n\n<answer>799 - 57 - (36 - 17) = 723</answer>"}]}

Breaking it down, maybe I can see what operations could get close. Let's check the big numbers first. 93 and 71 are both in the 90s and 70s. Maybe multiplying some of them?\n\nIf I multiply 93 by 7, that's 93*7=651. That's close to 644, but 651-7=644? Wait, but I already used 7 and 93. Then I have 71 and 70 left. Hmm, maybe subtract 71-70=1, then 651-1=650. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 71*70 is a big number, 4970. That's way too big. Maybe divide instead. 70 divided by 7 is 10. Then 71*10=710.

Not helpful.\n\nAnother approach: 70*7=490. Then 490 plus 93 is 583. Then add 71, which is 654. That's over. 583+71=654. Hmm. 654-10=644. Wait, how do I get 10? Maybe 70 divided by 7 is 10. So 654 -10=644. But then how do I use all numbers? Let me see. If I do 70*7 +93 +71 - (70/7). Wait, but I'm using 70 twice here. That's not allowed. Each number can only be used once.\n\nWait, maybe I need to structure it differently. Let's think. Let's try 93 * 7 = 651. Then 651 - something. What if I use 71 and 70. 71 +70=141. 651 -141=510. Not enough. 651 - (71 -70) = 650. Still not.\n\nWait, maybe 93 +71=164. Then 164 * something. 164*4=656, which is close. But how to get 4 from 70 and 7. 70/7=10. Hmm. Not helpful. 70-7=63. 164* (70-7) would be way too big.\n\nWait, what if I subtract 70 and 7 first? 70-7=63. Then 93*63? That's 93*60=5580, 93*3=279, so 5580+279=5859. Way too big. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 71 multiplied by something. 71*9=639. Close to 644. 71*9 +5=644. But how to get 9 and 5 from 93,70,7. Not sure.\n\nWait, 71*9=639. 9 can be 93-70=23. No. Not 9. Wait, 7* something. 7*92=644. Oh! Because 7*90=630, 7*2=14, 630+14=644. So 7*(90+2)=644. But how to get 90+2 from 93,71,70. Let's see. 93-3=90, and 71-70=1. So 3 and 1. But 3+1=4, not 2. Hmm. Maybe 93 - (71 +70) = 93-141= -48. That's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 93 -70=23. Then 23 + something. 23*7=161. 161*4=644. But where to get 4? 71-70=1, 7-1=6. Not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps 70*(something) + something. 70*9=630. Then 630 +14=644. 14 can be 7*2. So 70*9 +7*2. But how to get 9 and 2 from 93 and 71. Let's see: 93 - (71 +2). Wait, 93-71=22. 22 divided by something. 22/11=2. But how to get 11. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, 70*9 + (93 -71). 70*9=630. 93-71=22. 630+22=652. Close, but not 644.\n\nHmm. Let's try another angle.

Let me start by thinking about possible combinations.\n\nFirst, maybe start with the larger numbers. 88 and 58 are both big. If I subtract them: 88 - 58 is 30. Then what about 54 and 3? Let's see, maybe 54 divided by 3 is 18. Then 30 + 18 would be 48. Not close. Alternatively, maybe 54 - 3 = 51. Then 30 + 51 = 81. Still not 89.\n\nAlternatively, if I add 88 and 58, that's 146.

But wait, are we allowed to use all the numbers in that way? Each number is used once, and the operations are addition and subtraction. Let me count: 88, 58, 54, 3. All used once. The equation would be (88 +58) -54 -3. Let's compute step by step. 88+58=146. 146-54=92. 92-3=89. Yes! That works. So the equation is (88 +58) -54 -3 =89. Let me make sure there's no other way. Alternatively, maybe multiplication or division can be involved. Let's check if another combination works. For example, maybe 54 divided by 3 is 18. Then 88 - (58 -18) =88 -40=48. Not 89. Or 88 -58=30. Then 54 divided by 3 is 18. 30 +18=48. Still not. Another idea: 54 +3=57. 88 -57=31. 58 +31=89. Wait, 58 + (88 - (54 +3)) =58 + (88-57)=58 +31=89. That's another way. Let me check: 54+3=57. 88-57=31. 58+31=89. So the equation would be 58 + (88 - (54 +3)) =89. Which uses all numbers once. Both equations work. Which one is simpler? The first one is 88+58-54-3. The second one is 58 +88 -54 -3. Either way, same result. But maybe the parentheses are needed in the second version.

So maybe either form is acceptable. But the problem says to return the equation, so I should format it properly. Let's see, the first approach: 88+58-54-3. Let's verify: 88+58=146. 146-54=92. 92-3=89. Correct. So that's a valid equation. Alternatively, the second approach uses parentheses: 58 + (88 - (54 +3)). Which would be 58 + (88 -57) =58 +31=89. Also correct. So both are valid. Which one to choose? The problem allows any use of the operations as long as all numbers are used once. So either equation is acceptable. However, perhaps the first one is simpler without parentheses. But let's check if the problem requires parentheses. The example given was (1 + 2)/3. So maybe when operations have different precedence, parentheses are needed. In the first equation, since we are doing addition and subtraction left to right, parentheses aren't necessary. So 88 +58 -54 -3 would be the same as (88 +58) -54 -3. But perhaps to make it explicit, the user might prefer parentheses. Alternatively, maybe another equation uses multiplication or division. Let's check if there's another solution. Let me see. For example, maybe 88 - (54 / (58 - 3)). Let's compute that. 58-3=55. 54/55 is approximately 0.98. 88 -0.98≈87.02. Not 89. Not helpful. Another idea: 58 * 3 =174. Then 88 +54=142. 174 -142=32. Not 89. Alternatively, 54*3=162. 88 -58=30. 162 +30=192. Not 89. How about 88 - (54/(58-3))? Wait, that was tried earlier. What about (58 +54) + (88/3)? But 88/3 is around 29.333. 58+54=112. 112+29.333≈141.333. Not 89. Also, division would not result in an integer here. Maybe (88 -54) * 3 +58. Let's compute: 88-54=34. 34*3=102. 102+58=160. Nope. How about (88 -3) * (54 -58). That would be 85*(-4)= -340. Not 89. Not helpful. Another angle: 58 + 88 =146. 54 /3=18. 146 -18=128. Not 89. Hmm. Alternatively, 88 + (54 /3) =88+18=106. 106 -58 -3=45. No. Not helpful. So the two equations I found earlier are the possible ones. Either 88+58-54-3=89 or 58 + (88 -54 -3)=89. Since all numbers are used once and operations are basic. The first equation is straightforward. Let me confirm once more: 88 +58 is 146, minus 54 is 92, minus 3 is 89. Correct. So the equation would be (88 + 58) - 54 - 3 = 89. Or written without parentheses as 88 +58 -54 -3 =89. But perhaps the user expects the equation with parentheses for clarity, even if not strictly necessary. The example given used parentheses even though division has higher precedence. So maybe to format it properly, adding parentheses for clarity. So (88 + 58) - 54 - 3 =89. Alternatively, it's okay to write it without parentheses since addition and subtraction are left-associative. But according to the example, the user provided (1 + 2)/3, which includes parentheses. So perhaps the user wants equations that explicitly group operations, even if not necessary. So in this case, maybe (88 + 58) -54 -3. Alternatively, another way: 58 + 88 -54 -3. Either way. Both are correct. Let's write it as (88 + 58) -54 -3. Alternatively, maybe another arrangement. Let me check if there's a way to use division or multiplication. Let's think again. Suppose I do 88 divided by something. 88 divided by (3 - (58-54)). Let's see: 58-54=4. 3-4= -1. 88/-1= -88. Not helpful. Another idea: 54 divided by (58 -88) *3. 58-88= -30. 54/-30= -1.8. *3= -5.4. Not useful. How about (88*3) -58 -54. 88*3=264. 264-58=206. 206-54=152. Not 89. Hmm. Another attempt: (54 -3) * (88 /58). 51*(1.517)= around 77.37. Not 89. Not helpful. Maybe (58 +3) * (88 -54). 61*34=2074. Way too big. No. So seems like the only valid equations are the ones using addition and subtraction. So the answer is either of those. Let me confirm once more. Using all numbers once, and the result is 89. Yes. So the equation is (88 +58) -54 -3 =89. Alternatively, 88 +58 -54 -3 =89. Either way. The problem allows any basic operations, but in this case, addition and subtraction suffice. So the answer is (88 + 58) - 54 - 3 =89.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(88 + 58) - 54 - 3 = 89</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using the numbers 1, 15, 81, and 15 exactly once each, and combine them with basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) to get 144. Hmm, where do I start?\n\nFirst, I should think about the target number, 144. What are some factors of 144? Let's list them out. 144 is 12 squared, 16*9, 18*8, 24*6, etc. But maybe there's a way to use multiplication here. Since we have 81, which is 9 squared, and 15s, maybe multiplying 15 by something could help.\n\nWait, 15 multiplied by 9 is 135. If I could get 9 from the remaining numbers, but I have 1 and another 15 left. That might not work. Alternatively, 81 is 9*9, maybe I can use that. Let's see: 15 + 15 is 30. If I subtract 1, that's 29. Not helpful. Hmm.\n\nAnother approach: 81 divided by something. 81 divided by 1 is 81. Then 81 plus 15 is 96, plus 15 is 111. Not 144. Maybe 81 times (15/15) would be 81*1, which is 81, but then plus 1 is 82. Still not.\n\nWhat if I subtract numbers? 81 - 15 is 66, then 66 -15 is 51, then 51 +1 is 52. Nope. \n\nMaybe multiplication and division together. Let's try combining the two 15s. 15 divided by 15 is 1. Then we have 1 and 1 and 81. 81 times 1 times 1 is 81. Not enough. So that's not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps using 15 * 15. That's 225. Then subtract 81? 225 -81 = 144. Oh! Wait, that's 15*15 -81 = 144. But we have to use all the numbers, including the 1. Oh right, we need to use all four numbers once. So this approach uses two 15s and 81, but leaves out the 1. So that's a problem.\n\nSo maybe we need to incorporate the 1 somehow into that equation. Let's see. If we take 15*15 -81 =144, but we have an extra 1. How can we adjust it? Maybe divide by 1? Because dividing by 1 doesn't change the value. So (15*15 -81)/1 = 144. But wait, is that acceptable? Let me check: 15*15 is 225, 225 -81 is 144, then divide by 1 is still 144. Yes. So that uses all numbers: 15,15,81, and 1, each once. And the operations are *, -, /.\n\nBut wait, does the problem allow parentheses? The example given includes parentheses, so I think it's allowed. So the equation would be (15 * 15 - 81) / 1 = 144. Let me verify:\n\n15 * 15 = 225\n\n225 - 81 = 144\n\n144 / 1 = 144. Yes, that works. And all numbers are used once. So that's the solution. Alternatively, maybe another arrangement, but this seems to fit. Let me check if there's another way, just to be sure.\n\nAnother idea: 81 + 15 + 15 + 1 = 112. No, that's too low. Multiplication? 81 * 1 =81, then 15*15=225. 225 -81=144. Wait, that's the same as before but written differently: 15*15 -81*1 =144. So that uses all numbers. So the equation would be 15*15 -81*1 =144. Let's check:\n\n15*15 =225, 81*1=81. 225-81=144. Yes. So this way, multiplication is used twice, subtraction once. All numbers used once. But the problem says \"using each number once and all numbers\". So both approaches are valid. Which one is better? The first one uses division, the second uses two multiplications. The problem allows any operations, so either would work. Let's see the example given was (1 + 2)/3, which uses parentheses. So perhaps the first version with parentheses is acceptable. But the second version without parentheses is also correct.\n\nWait, let me check the order of operations in the second equation: 15*15 -81*1. Since multiplication is done before subtraction, this would compute as (15*15) - (81*1) = 225 -81=144. So parentheses are not needed here. So the equation can be written as 15 * 15 - 81 * 1 = 144. That uses all numbers once and operations correctly. So this is another valid equation.\n\nBut the problem requires creating an equation that equals 144. So either form is acceptable. However, the problem requires that all numbers are used, and in either case, they are. Let's check both possibilities.\n\nAlternatively, maybe another arrangement: (81 - (15 -1)) *15. Let's compute:\n\n15-1=14\n\n81-14=67\n\n67*15=1005. No, that's too big. Not helpful.\n\nAnother idea: 81 * (15 /15 ) +1. 15/15=1, so 81*1 +1=82. Not 144.\n\nHmm. What about 81 + (15 * (15 -1))? Let's see: 15-1=14, 15*14=210, 81+210=291. No.\n\nAlternatively, (15 +15) * (81 / something). 15+15=30, 81 divided by... Maybe 81 divided by (something) to get 4.8, but that's not an integer. 30*4.8=144. So 81 divided by (something) equals 4.8. Let's see. 81 divided by x =4.8 → x=81/4.8=16.875. But we have to make that x using the remaining numbers, which would be 1 and... Wait, but we already used 15 and 15. So perhaps (15 +15) * (81 / (1 * something)), but we don't have a number left. So that might not work.\n\nAlternatively, 81 * ( (15 +15) /1 ). But that's 81*30=2430. Way too big.\n\nWait, maybe (81 -1) * (15/15). That would be 80 *1=80. Not 144.\n\nHmm. Let me go back to the previous idea. The two possible equations are:\n\n(15 * 15) - (81 / 1) = 225 -81=144. Wait, no, 81 divided by 1 is 81. Wait, 15*15=225, 225 -81=144. Then, where is the 1 used? Oh, right, the other idea was (15*15 -81)/1=144. But that uses the 1 in division. But in this case, if I just write 15*15 -81*1=144, that uses all numbers: 15,15,81,1. So that's valid. Because each number is used once. Let me confirm: 15 (used in 15*15), 15, 81 (used in 81*1), and 1. All four numbers used. So that's correct. Therefore, the equation is 15 * 15 - 81 * 1 = 144. Alternatively, if written with parentheses, but multiplication takes precedence, so it's okay.\n\nTherefore, this equation works. Let me check once more:\n\n15 * 15 = 225\n\n81 * 1 =81\n\n225 -81 =144. Correct.\n\nYes, that's the solution. So the equation is 15*15 -81*1 =144.\n</think>\n\n<answer>15 * 15 - 81 * 1 = 144</answer>"}]}

The result should be 288. Let me think.\n\nHmm, the target is 288, which is already one of the numbers. That's interesting. So maybe I need to use 288 as the result and somehow manipulate the other numbers to form an expression that equals 288. But wait, the problem says I have to use all the numbers, including 288. Wait, no, the target is 288, and I need to create an equation that equals 288 using all the given numbers once each. So 288 is the result, and I have to use 68, 2, 34, and 288 in the equation. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the problem says \"create an equation that equals 288\" using the numbers 68, 288, 2, 34. Each number can be used only once, and all must be used. So 288 is one of the numbers to be used in the equation, not the result. Wait, but the equation's result needs to be 288. So the numbers given are 68, 288, 2, 34, and I have to use all of them with each used once, combining them with operations to get 288. Wait, that makes more sense. So 288 is part of the input numbers, and the equation's result is 288. So I need to use 68, 288, 2, 34, each once, with operations, to make 288. So maybe 288 is part of the equation, but how?\n\nWait, but if I have 288 as one of the numbers, perhaps I can subtract or add it to something to get back to 288. For example, 288 + (something - something) = 288. But then I have to use all numbers. Let's see. For instance, 288 + (68 - 68) would be 288, but I can't use 68 twice. Wait, the numbers are 68, 288, 2, 34. So maybe 288 + (68 - 34 - 2) = 288 + (32) = 320. Not 288. Not helpful. Alternatively, 288 * (something). But multiplying 288 by anything other than 1 would change it. Alternatively, dividing 288 by 1, but 1 isn't a given number. Wait, but maybe 288 * (34 / 34) = 288, but again, 34 is a number here. Let me try to see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using 68 and 34. Since 68 is 2*34. So maybe I can use that relationship. For example, 68 / 34 = 2. But 2 is another number we have. So if I do 68 / 34 = 2, then I have used 68, 34, and 2. Then I have 288 left. But how to combine them. Maybe 288 * (68 / 34) / 2 = 288 * 2 / 2 = 288. Wait, that's possible. Let me check. 68 divided by 34 is 2, then multiplied by 288 gives 576, divided by 2 gives 288. So that uses all numbers: 288, 68, 34, 2. The equation would be (288 * (68 / 34)) / 2 = 288. Let me compute that step by step. 68 divided by 34 is 2. Then 288 multiplied by 2 is 576. Then 576 divided by 2 is 288. Yes, that works. All numbers are used once: 288, 68, 34, 2. The operations are division, multiplication, and division again. So the equation would be (288 * (68 / 34)) / 2 = 288. Alternatively, written without parentheses, but order of operations applies. Let me check if the parentheses are necessary. 68 / 34 is 2, so 288 * 2 is 576, then /2 gives 288. So yes, the parentheses are necessary to do the division first. Alternatively, 288 * 68 /34 /2. Let's compute that: 288*68=19584, divided by 34 is 576, then divided by 2 is 288. So yes, that works. So the equation can be written as 288 * 68 / 34 / 2. Let me confirm:\n\n288 * 68 = 19584\n\n19584 / 34 = 576\n\n576 / 2 = 288\n\nYes, that's correct. So all numbers are used once, operations are * and /, and the result is 288. So the equation is 288 × 68 ÷ 34 ÷ 2 = 288. Alternatively, with parentheses, maybe (288 × (68 ÷ 34)) ÷ 2. Either way, both expressions are equivalent. So this should be the answer.\n</think>\n\n<answer>288 * 68 / 34 / 2</answer>"}]}

Let's start by thinking about the target number. 456 is a bit large, so maybe multiplication is involved here.\n\nFirst, let's list the numbers: 1, 44, 6, 32. Let's consider possible pairings. The larger numbers are 44 and 32. If I multiply those together, 44*32=1408. That's way bigger than 456. So maybe subtract something from that? But 1408 minus something else... Maybe 44*(32 - something)? Let's see. 32-6=26. 44*26=1144. Still too big. Hmm.\n\nWait, 456 divided by 44 is about 10.36. So 44*10.36 would be 456. But how to get 10.36 with 1,6,32? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe 44* (something). Let's think of 32 and 6. 32-6=26. 44*26=1144. Then subtract 1? That's 1143. No. Not helpful. \n\nWhat if I use division?

Then subtract 6? 1408-6=1402. Nope. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe 6 multiplied by something. 6*44=264. Then 264*1.727... would be 456. But getting 1.727 from 32 and the other numbers. Wait, 32/1=32. Hmm. 264 + 32=296. No. Not enough. \n\nAlternatively, 6*32=192. Then 192*2.375=456. How to get 2.375 from 44 and 1. Maybe (44/1)/something. 44 divided by 16 is 2.75. Wait, 44 divided by (something like 16). But we don't have 16. Alternatively, 44 - 1 =43. 192 +43=235. No.\n\nWait, maybe (44 +32)=76. Then 76 *6=456. Oh! Wait, 44 +32=76. 76*6=456. But then where does the 1 go? Because we have to use all numbers. Oh, right. So 76*6=456, but we still have the 1 left. How to incorporate 1? Maybe 76*(6 +1)=76*7=532. No, that's over. Or (76+1)*6=77*6=462. Closer, but not 456. 462-6=456, but that would use 6 twice. Not allowed.\n\nAlternatively, 44* (32 - (6/1))=44*(32-6)=44*26=1144. Not helpful. \n\nWait another approach: 456 divided by 32 is 14.25. So if I can get 14.25 from 44, 6, and 1. Let's see. 44 divided by (6 -1) is 44/5=8.8. 32*8.8=281.6. Not helpful. \n\nHmm. Maybe 44* (something). Let's see 44*10 =440. Then adding 16 would get to 456. How to get 16 from 6,1,32. 32/ (6-1)=32/5=6.4. Not 16. 6*1=6. 32-6=26. No. \n\nWait, 32 - (6/1) =32-6=26. Then 44*26=1144. Again, too big.\n\nAlternatively, 44* (6 +1) =44*7=308. 308*32=9856. Way too big. Maybe 308 +32=340. Not enough.\n\nWait, maybe (44 -1) =43. 43* (32-6)=43*26=1118. Nope.\n\nAlternatively, 6*(44 + 32) =6*76=456. Oh! Wait, 44+32 is 76. Multiply by 6: 76*6=456. That uses 44,32,6. Then where's the 1? Oh, we have to use all numbers. So this approach uses three numbers but leaves out the 1. So that's a problem. How can we include the 1 without changing the result? Maybe (44 +32) *6 +1=456+1=457. No. Or subtract 1: 456-1=455. Not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, maybe (44 +32 +1) *6=77*6=462. Close but not 456. 462-6=456 but that uses 6 twice. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps using division. Let's think: 44* (32 - (6/1))=44*(32-6)=44*26=1144. Not helpful. Alternatively, (44*6) * (32-1)=264*31=8184. Way too big.\n\nAlternatively, 44 * (32 / (6 -1))=44*(32/5)=44*6.4=281.6. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe (32* (44 -6)) /1. Let's see: 32*38=1216. 1216/1=1216. No.\n\nAlternatively, (44 -6) * (32 +1)=38*33=1254. No.\n\nHmm. Maybe combine the 1 with another number. Like 1+44=45. Then 45 * (32-6)=45*26=1170. Still not.\n\nWait, 32 divided by (something). Let's see 32/(1/6)=32*6=192. Then 192* (44- something). 192*2=384. 192*2.375=456. How to get 2.375 from 44. Maybe (44/ something). 44 divided by 32=1.375. Then 1.375 +1=2.375. Wait, 44/32=1.375. So (1.375 +1)=2.375. Then 192*2.375=456. So putting this together: (32/(1/6)) * ( (44/32) +1 ) = ?\n\nBut let's check the operations. Breaking it down:\n\nFirst, 1/6 is a division. Then 32 divided by (1/6) is 32*6=192. Then, 44 divided by 32 is 1.375. Adding 1 gives 2.375. Multiply 192 by 2.375: 192 * 2.375 = 456. \n\nBut let's see if we can write this equation using each number once. Let's see:\n\nThe operations used are: (32 / (1/6)) * ( (44 /32) +1 )\n\nBut let's parse this step by step. \n\nFirst part: 32 divided by (1/6) uses 32, 1, 6. Then the second part: 44 divided by 32 uses 44 and 32 again, which is a problem because we can't reuse 32. So that's invalid. So that approach doesn't work because 32 is used twice.\n\nSo that's not allowed. So that idea is out.\n\nHmm. Let's think differently. Maybe use subtraction. Let's try 44* (6 +32) -1. So 44*38=1672, minus 1=1671. Nope. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, (44*6) + (32*1). 264 +32=296. Not enough.\n\nWait, 44* (6 +1) =44*7=308. 308 +32=340. Still not 456.\n\nAlternatively, 44*10.3636=456. So 10.3636 is approximately 32/ (something). Let's see 32 /3.125=10.24. Close but not exact. Maybe not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps 44* (32 -6) /1=44*26=1144. No. Not helpful.\n\nAnother angle: 6* (44 +32) =6*76=456. As before. But how to use 1. So maybe we can write it as (44 +32) *6 *1. Because multiplying by 1 doesn't change the value. So (44 +32) *6 *1 =76*6=456. But that uses all numbers: 44,32,6,1. Each once. Wait, is that allowed? Let's check: Yes, because multiplication is associative. So (44 +32) *6 *1. But wait, addition is part of the equation. So the equation would be ((44 +32) *6) *1 =456. Which is the same as (44+32)*6*1=456. But since multiplying by 1 doesn't change anything, but we have to use all numbers. So including the 1 as a multiplier is valid. So maybe the equation is (44 +32) *6 *1 =456. Let me check:\n\n44+32=76. 76*6=456. 456*1=456. So yes. But is this acceptable? Because each number is used once. So 44,32,6,1. All used. The operations are +, *, *. So yes. So this equation would be (44 + 32) × 6 × 1 =456. But the problem says to create an equation using each number once and all the numbers. So this works. Wait, but the problem says \"using the numbers 1, 44, 6, 32\" each once, with operations. So in this case, the equation is (44 + 32) *6 *1. Let's see:\n\nYes, each number is used once: 44,32,6,1. Operations: +, *, *. So that's valid. \n\nWait, but is multiplication by 1 considered an operation? Because technically, you can write it as multiplying by 1, which is allowed. So this seems like a valid solution. \n\nBut maybe the system expects all operations to be explicitly used, but multiplication by 1 is allowed. So the equation would be ((44 +32) *6) *1 =456. Alternatively, without parentheses: 44 +32 *6 *1. But that would be 44 + (32*6*1)=44+192=236. Which is wrong. So the correct way is (44+32)*6*1=456.\n\nSo this equation uses all numbers once and the operations + and * twice. So that's acceptable. So the answer is (44 + 32) * 6 * 1 =456. But in the required format, inside <answer> tags. So the equation is (44 + 32) * 6 * 1. \n\nBut let me verify again. 44+32 is 76. 76*6 is 456. 456*1 is 456. So yes, equals 456. All numbers used once. Operations: +, *, *.\n\nYes, this should work. That seems to be the solution. So the answer is (44 + 32) * 6 * 1. But in the example given, the user showed (1 + 2)/3. So parentheses are used for the order of operations. Here, the parentheses are needed to group the addition first. So the equation is correct.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(44 + 32) * 6 * 1</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using the numbers 40, 12, 55, and 23 exactly once each, with basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) any number of times, and the result should be 20. Hmm, tricky.\n\nFirst, maybe I should list out all possible operations and see if I can combine them step by step. Let's think about the order of operations and how combining these numbers might lead to 20.\n\nStarting with the larger numbers: 55 and 40. If I subtract them, 55 - 40 = 15. Then maybe use the other numbers 12 and 23. But 15 plus 12 is 27, minus 23 is 4. Not 20. Alternatively, 55 divided by something? 55 divided by 23 is about 2.39, which might not help. Hmm.\n\nWait, 23 is a prime number. Let's think about combining 12 and 23 first. 23 minus 12 is 11. Then 55 minus 40 is 15. 11 plus 15 is 26. Not helpful. Maybe multiply 23 and 12? 23*12=276, which is too big. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, could I use division in a smart way? Like (55 - 23) is 32. Then 32 divided by something. 40 divided by 12 is around 3.333. If I do 32 / (40/12), that's 32 * (12/40) = 32*0.3 = 9.6. Not 20. Hmm.\n\nWait, 55 minus 23 minus 12? 55-23=32, 32-12=20. Oh, but then I still have 40 left. But I need to use all numbers. So that approach leaves 40 unused. So that doesn't work.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe use multiplication and division together. For example, 40 divided by (something) to get a smaller number. Let's see. If I do 40 / 20 = 2, but how to get 20 from the other numbers. Wait, maybe (55 - 23) is 32. Then 32 - 12 = 20. But again, 40 is left. So that approach uses 55,23,12 but not 40. Not allowed.\n\nWait, perhaps combine operations in a different way. Let's think of combining 40 and 12 first. 40 - 12 = 28. Then 55 - 23 = 32. 28 + 32 = 60. Not helpful. Or 55 + 23 =78, 78 -40=38, 38-12=26. Nope.\n\nHow about (55 - (40 / (23 -12)))? Let's check. 23-12=11. Then 40/11≈3.636. Then 55 -3.636≈51.364. Not 20. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (55 - 23) / (40 /12). So 32 divided by (40/12) = 32*(12/40)= 9.6. Not 20.\n\nWait, 55 divided by something. 55/(23 - (40/12))? Let's compute that denominator: 23 - (40/12) ≈23 -3.333=19.666. Then 55/19.666≈2.8. Not 20.\n\nAlternatively, 23 - (55 -40)/12. (55-40)=15. 15/12=1.25. 23 -1.25=21.75. Close but not 20.\n\nWhat if I do (55 - (23 + 12)) * something. 55-35=20. Then multiply by (40/x). Wait, but 20 * something would need to be 20, so 20*(40/x)=20 implies 40/x=1, so x=40. But then x would have to be from another number, but all numbers are used. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nWait, maybe (40 / (12 - (55 -23))). Let's compute 55-23=32. 12-32= -20. 40 / (-20)= -2. Not 20.\n\nAlternatively, 40 / ( (55 -23)/12 ). 55-23=32. 32/12≈2.666. 40 /2.666≈15. Not 20.\n\nHmm. Maybe using multiplication and subtraction. For example, 55 - (23 * (12 /40)). Let's see: 12/40=0.3. 23*0.3=6.9. 55-6.9≈48.1. Not 20.\n\nAnother approach: Combine 40 and 55. 40 +55=95. Then subtract something. 95 -23=72. 72 -12=60. Not helpful. Or 95 - (23+12)=95-35=60. Still no.\n\nWhat if we use division with 55 and 12? 55/12≈4.583. Then 23 - (40 - (55/12))? Let's compute: 40 -4.583≈35.417. Then 23 -35.417≈-12.417. Nope.\n\nWait, maybe 40 - (55 - 23) +12. 55-23=32. 40-32=8. 8+12=20. Oh! Wait, that uses all numbers: 40,55,23,12. Let me check:\n\n40 - (55 -23) +12 = 40 -32 +12 = (40 -32) +12 =8 +12=20. Yes! So the equation is 40 - (55 -23) +12 =20. But let's check if that uses all numbers once. 40,55,23,12. Yes, each is used once. So that works. But let me confirm the order of operations. Subtraction is left associative, but here parentheses are used. So 55-23 is done first, then 40 minus that result, then plus12. So yes, correct. So the equation is (40 - (55 -23)) +12. Wait, but is that the way to write it? Let's see: 40 - (55 -23) +12. But according to order of operations, parentheses first, then subtraction and addition from left to right. So 40 -32=8, then 8+12=20. So the equation is 40 - (55 -23) +12 =20. So written as (40 - (55 -23)) +12, but maybe with different grouping? But the original numbers are used once each. Let me verify again: 40,55,23,12. Each number is used once, and all are used. So the equation is 40 - (55 -23) +12 =20. So the equation written would be (40 - (55 - 23)) + 12 =20. But since we can arrange the numbers and operations, perhaps using parentheses correctly. Let me write the equation as (40 + 12) - (55 -23). Let's check: 40+12=52. 55-23=32. 52-32=20. Yes! That's another way. So (40 +12) - (55 -23)=20. This uses all numbers once and gives 20. That seems better and uses all numbers. So 40+12=52, then subtract (55-23)=32. 52-32=20. So the equation is (40 +12) - (55 -23)=20. So that works. So I think that's a valid equation. Let me check again: 40,12,55,23 each used once. Yes. Operations: + and - and the parentheses. Perfect. So the answer is (40 +12) - (55 -23)=20. Therefore, in the required format, the equation would be (40 + 12) - (55 - 23).\n</think>\n\n<answer>(40 + 12) - (55 - 23)</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using 555, 8, 53, and 68, each exactly once, and the result should be 911. Hmm, 911 is a pretty big number, so maybe multiplication will be involved here. Let me think about how these numbers can combine.\n\nFirst, looking at the largest number, 555. If I can use that in a way that gets close to 911, maybe subtract or add something. Let's see, 555 multiplied by something... 555*2 is 1110, which is way over. But maybe if I subtract or add other numbers. Wait, 555 plus 68 would be 623, still way below 911. Then adding 53 would get to 676, and 8... that's not enough. So adding directly probably isn't the way.\n\nWhat if I use multiplication with some of the other numbers. Let's check 53 and 68. 53 times 17 is 901, which is close to 911, but 17 isn't one of the numbers. Alternatively, 68 times 13 is 884, still not quite. Hmm. What if I subtract something from a product. Let me see: 68 * 53 is 3604. That's way too big. Then maybe 3604 divided by something. If I divide by 4, that's 901. But 4 isn't one of the numbers. Wait, but I have an 8. 3604 divided by 4 is 901, but 8 divided by 2 is 4. Hmm, but I can't split the 8. Wait, perhaps 68*53 = 3604. Then 3604 - 555 = 3049. That's way over. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 555 plus something. Let's see: 555 + 68 = 623. Then 623 + 53 = 676. Still need 235 more. But I have an 8 left. 8*29.375 is 235, but that's using 8 and another number, which I don't have. Hmm. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe combine the numbers in a different way. Let's think about 555 and 8. If I do 555 - 8, that's 547. Then multiply by something. 547*1.66 is about 911, but 1.66 is not a number here. Alternatively, maybe 555 divided by something. 555 divided by 5 is 111, which is not helpful. Or 555 divided by 8 is about 69.375. Then 69.375 plus 53 is 122.375. Then 122.375 * 68 is way over. That doesn't work.\n\nAnother angle: 911 is 900 + 11. How can I get 900 and 11 from the numbers? 555 + 345 = 900. But 345 can be made from 68, 53, 8? Let's see: 68*5 = 340, plus 5 is 345, but I don't have a 5. Alternatively, 53*6 is 318, 68*4 is 272. Not quite. Maybe 53*6 + 68*3 = 318 + 204 = 522. No, that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 900 can be 53*17 - 1. Not sure. Wait, 53*17 is 901. Oh, that's very close to 911. So 53*17 is 901, then 901 + 10 = 911. How can I get 17 and 10 from the remaining numbers? The remaining numbers would be 555, 8, 68. Hmm. Let me see. If I have 53*17, which is 901, then maybe add 10. But how to get 17 from 555, 8, 68? 68 divided by 4 is 17. But 4 would come from 8/2, but I need to use 555. Wait, perhaps 555 - (68 / (8))? Let's see: 68 divided by 8 is 8.5. Then 555 - 8.5 is 546.5. Not helpful. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 555 - (53*8). Let's calculate that: 53*8=424. 555-424=131. Then 131 + 68=199. Not 911. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe 555 multiplied by something. Let's see: 555*1.64 is approximately 911. How to get 1.64 from 68, 53, 8. Let me see. 68 divided by (53-8) is 68/45 ≈1.51. Not enough. Or (53+8)/68=61/68≈0.897. Multiply that by 555 gives about 497. Not helpful.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe combine 68 and 8 first. 68 - 8 = 60. Then 60*53=3180. Then 3180 divided by 555 is about 5.73. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 68 +8=76. 76*53=4028. Then 4028 divided by 555≈7.26. Still not useful.\n\nWait, maybe 68*53=3604. Then 3604 - (555* something). Let's see. 3604 - 555*5=3604-2775=829. Then 829 + 8=837. No. Not 911.\n\nAlternatively, 3604 - 555*4=3604-2220=1384. Then subtract 8*53=424. 1384-424=960. Not 911.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Let me try different operations. What if I use subtraction and division. For example, 555 - (68 / (8 - something)). Let's see. 8 - 53= -45. Then 68 / (-45)≈-1.51. 555 - (-1.51)=556.51. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe 555 + (68 * (8 - 53)). That's 555 + (68*(-45))=555 - 3060= -2505. No. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 555 + 68=623. Then 623 -53=570. 570*8=4560. Not helpful. Or 555 + (68 -53)=570. Then 570*8=4560. No. Not right.\n\nWait, 555 divided by 5 is 111, but I don't have a 5. But maybe 53-8=45. Then 555/45≈12.333. Then 12.333*68≈839. Not 911. Close, but not there.\n\nHmm. Let me try another angle. Let's see, 911 minus 555 is 356. So can I get 356 from 8, 53, 68? 68*5=340, 340+16=356. 16 is 8*2. But I can't use 2. Alternatively, 53*6=318, 318+38=356. 38 is 68-30. Not helpful. Wait, maybe 68*5 + 8=340+8=348. Close to 356. 348 + 8=356, but I can't reuse 8. Hmm. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 68 +53=121. Then 121*3=363. 363-7=356. But again, 7 isn't available. Not helpful.\n\nWhat if I do 53*8=424. 424-68=356. Yes! Wait, 53*8=424. Then 424-68=356. Then 555 + 356=911. Oh! Wait, but I need to use all the numbers once. Let's check:\n\n555 + (53*8 -68) = 555 + (424 -68) = 555 + 356 = 911. Yes! Let's verify if all numbers are used once: 555, 53, 8, 68. All four numbers are used exactly once. So that works. So the equation is 555 + (53*8 -68) = 911.\n\nLet me check the calculation again:\n\n53*8 = 424. 424 -68=356. 555 +356=911. Correct. So the equation is 555 + 53*8 -68 =911. But since all operations are addition and subtraction/multiplication, parentheses might not be necessary, but to make the order clear, maybe include them. But according to order of operations, multiplication comes first, so 53*8 is calculated first, then subtract 68, then add to 555. So the equation can be written as 555 + (53 × 8) − 68 = 911.\n\nYes, that works. So I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\n<answer>555 + (53 * 8) - 68 = 911</answer>"}]}

Each number has to be used once, and I can use basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division. Alright, let's start by thinking about the target number, 51. Maybe breaking it down into parts.\n\nFirst, 51 is a prime number, so factoring might not help much. But maybe combining some of the larger numbers. Let's look at the numbers given: 3, 39, 96, 36. Let's see, 39 is close to 40, which is 51 - 11. Not sure. Wait, 39 is 3*13, but 3 is already one of the numbers. Maybe that's a path. If I use 3 and 39, perhaps in a division. Like 39 divided by 3 is 13. Then maybe combine that with 96 and 36. But how?\n\nAlternatively, 96 is a big number. If I subtract something from 96 to get close to 51. 96 minus 45 is 51. But do I have a 45? Well, 36 + 9 is 45. Do I have a 9? Maybe 3*3, but I can only use 3 once. Hmm. Alternatively, 36 divided by something. 36 divided by 4 is 9, but I don't have a 4. Wait, 96 divided by something? Let's see.\n\nAnother approach: 39 + 12 = 51. How to get 12? Maybe 36 divided by 3 is 12. So 39 + (36/3) = 39 +12=51. Then what about 96? Wait, that uses 39, 36, 3, but leaves out 96. Oh, but we have to use all numbers. So that's a problem. So maybe that's not the way.\n\nAlternatively, 96 - 45 = 51. So how to make 45 from 3, 39, 36. Let's see. 36 + 9 =45. How to get 9 from 3 and 39? 39 divided by something. 39/13=3, but 13 isn't available. Wait, 3*3=9, but again, can't use 3 twice. Hmm. Maybe 36 - (39/3). 39/3=13, so 36-13=23. Then 96 -23=73. Not helpful.\n\nWait, another idea: 96 divided by something. 96/16=6. But how to get 16? Maybe 36 - 20=16. But where's 20? 39 -19=20? Not helpful. Alternatively, 3 + 39=42. Then 96 -42=54. 54-3=51, but that uses 3 twice. Not allowed.\n\nWait, maybe combining 96 and 36. 96 -36=60. Then 60 -9=51. How to get 9 from 3 and 39? 39 divided by something. 39 divided by 13 is 3, but again, no 13. Alternatively, 3*3=9. Can't do that. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, 39 + 36=75. Then 75 - something=51. 75-24=51. How to get 24? 96 divided by 4=24. How to get 4? 36 divided by 9=4. But 9 would be 3*3. Not possible. Alternatively, 96 divided by (3 + something). Let's see, 96/(3 + x)=24. Then x would be 1. But how to get 1 from 39 and 36? Maybe 39-36=3. Then 3 +3=6. 96/6=16. Hmm. Not helpful.\n\nAnother angle: Use multiplication and division to combine numbers. For example, 96 / 3 =32. Then 32 + something=51. 51-32=19. Can I get 19 from 39 and 36? 39 -20=19. How to get 20 from 36? Not sure. 36 divided by something? 36/1.8=20. But that's not an integer. Alternatively, 39 - (36/ something). If 36/2=18, 39-18=21. Not 19. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe 39 - (36/3). 36/3=12, so 39-12=27. Then 96 /3=32, 32 +27=59. Not 51.\n\nAlternatively, 96 - (39 + 36) +3. Let's compute that: 96 -75 +3=24. Not 51.\n\nWait, 36 +3=39. Then 39 + (96 -39)=96. But that doesn't help. Alternatively, 96 - 36=60. 60 -39=21. 21 +3=24. No.\n\nHmm. Let's think of combining operations. Maybe 96 divided by (something) plus something else. For example, 96/(36/3) + 39. Let's see: 36 divided by3 is 12. So 96/12=8. Then 8 +39=47. Not 51.\n\nWait, 39 + (96/ (36/3)). Let's compute that. 36/3=12, 96/12=8. 39+8=47. Still no.\n\nHow about 96 - (39 - (36/3))? Let's see: 36/3=12, 39-12=27, 96-27=69. Not 51.\n\nAlternatively, (96 + 36) divided by something. 96+36=132. 132 divided by 2.588≈51. But 2.588 is not an integer. Not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps using multiplication. Let's see: 3 * something. 3 *17=51. How to get 17 from 39,96,36. Let's see: 39 - (96/36)=39 - (2.666)=36.333. Not 17. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, (96 - 39) =57. Then 57 - (36/3)=57 -12=45. Not 51. Close.\n\nWait, 39 + 3=42. 96 - 36=60. 60 -42=18. No. Not helpful.\n\nAnother thought: 36 * 3=108. Then 108 - something=51. 108-57=51. 57 can be 39 +18. 18 from 96? 96/ something. 96/5.333=18. Not helpful. Alternatively, 96 - 39=57. Then 108 -57=51. But that would be (36*3) - (96-39)=108 -57=51. Let's check if all numbers are used: 36,3,96,39. Yes, each once. Wait, is that correct?\n\nWait: 36 * 3 =108. Then 96 -39=57. Then 108 -57=51. So combining these steps: (36 *3) - (96 -39)=51. Let's compute:\n\n36*3=108\n\n96-39=57\n\n108-57=51. Yes, that works. Let me check if all numbers are used: 36,3,96,39. Yes! All four numbers are used once. So the equation would be (36 * 3) - (96 - 39) =51. But wait, the original numbers given are 3,39,96,36. So that uses all four. That's the solution. Let me verify:\n\n36*3=108\n\n96-39=57\n\n108-57=51. Correct.\n\nSo the equation is (36 * 3) - (96 - 39) =51. So written as an equation with all numbers used once, that's correct.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(36 * 3) - (96 - 39) = 51</answer>"}]}

Let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should note that all numbers must be used, so I can't leave any out. The operations can be combined in any way, but each number is used once. Let's start by looking at the target number, 813, and see how these numbers can combine to reach it.\n\nLet me list the numbers again: 271, 31, 88, 295. Let's see their approximate sizes. 271 and 295 are both in the 200s, 88 is around 100, and 31 is smaller. Maybe adding some of them together? Let's check:\n\nIf I add 271 + 295, that gives 566. Then 566 + 88 = 654, and adding 31 would give 685, which is too low. Alternatively, if I subtract instead. Maybe 295 - 271 = 24, which is small. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, multiplying some of them. Let's see, 295 is a big number. If I multiply 295 by 3, that's 885, which is close to 813. But how can I get 3 from the remaining numbers? Let's see: 31, 88, 271. Hmm. 88 divided by 31 is approximately 2.838... which isn't 3. Alternatively, 271 minus 268 (but we don't have 268). Hmm, not sure.\n\nWait, maybe 295 multiplied by something else. Let's try 295 * 3 = 885. 885 - 72 = 813. Where can I get 72 from? The numbers left would be 271, 31, 88. Let's see: 88 - (271/31). Wait, 271 divided by 31 is approximately 8.7419. 88 minus that is about 79.258. Then 885 - 79.258 ≈ 805.74, not 813. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 295 * 2. Let's see, 295*2 = 590. Then 813 - 590 = 223. Can I get 223 from the remaining numbers: 271, 31, 88. Let's see. 271 - 31 = 240. 240 - 88 = 152. No. 88 + 31 = 119. 271 - 119 = 152. Not 223. Alternatively, 271 + 31 = 302. 302 - 88 = 214. Close to 223 but not quite.\n\nAlternatively, 295 * 3 = 885, and then subtract 72. Wait, 885 - 72 = 813. So how to get 72. Let's see, remaining numbers are 271, 31, 88. Maybe 88 - (271/31). Wait, 271 divided by 31 is approximately 8.7419, so 88 - 8.7419 ≈ 79.258. That's not 72. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 271 - 31 = 240. Then 240 / 88 = approximately 2.727. If we take 295 * that, 295 * 2.727 ≈ 804. That's close to 813 but not exactly. Maybe not helpful.\n\nAnother approach: Let's see what 271 + 295 = 566. Then 566 + 88 = 654. Then 654 + 31 = 685. Not enough. Alternatively, 566 * something. But 566 * 1.44 would be around 813, but how to get 1.44 from 88 and 31. 88/31 ≈ 2.838. Not 1.44. Alternatively, 31/88 ≈ 0.352. 566 + (something), but not sure.\n\nWait, maybe using division and multiplication. Let's think: 295 is a big number. If we do 295 * 3, as before. 3 could come from 88 / 31 ≈ 2.838. Not quite 3. Maybe 271 divided by something. 271 / 31 ≈ 8.7419. Hmm. 88 - (271/31) ≈ 79.258. Then 295 + 79.258 ≈ 374.258. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe 295 + 271 = 566. Then 566 + 88 = 654. Then 654 + 31 = 685. Still not 813. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, 295 - 271 = 24. Then 24 * 31 = 744. Then 744 + 88 = 832. Close but over. 832 - 19 = 813. But where to get 19? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe 24 * something else. 24 * 34 = 816, which is 3 over. But how to get 34? 88 - 54 = 34. Not helpful.\n\nWait, another idea: 88 * 9 = 792. Then 792 + 21 = 813. Where would 21 come from? Maybe 31 - (295/271). Let's calculate 295/271 ≈ 1.088. Then 31 - 1.088 ≈ 29.912. 88 * 9 would need to be 792, but how to get 9? 271/31 ≈ 8.7419. Not 9. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, 88 * (something) = 813. Let's see 813 divided by 88 ≈ 9.2386. So if I can get 9.2386 from 271, 31, 295. Not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps combining subtraction and division. Let's try 295 * 3 = 885, then subtract 72. How to get 72 from 271, 31, 88. Let's see: 88 - (271 / 31). Wait, 271 divided by 31 is approximately 8.7419. So 88 - 8.7419 ≈ 79.258. 885 - 79.258 ≈ 805.74. Not 813. Close but not exact.\n\nAlternatively, 88 + 31 = 119. Then 271 - 119 = 152. Then 295 + 152 = 447. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe (295 + 271) = 566. Then 566 + (88 - 31) = 566 + 57 = 623. Still too low.\n\nHmm, maybe multiplication and division. Let's think about 271 and 31. 271 is a prime number, maybe that's tricky. 88 is 8*11. 295 is 5*59. Let's see:\n\nWhat if we do 88 * 31? 88*31=2728. That's way too big. Maybe subtract something. 88*31=2728. 2728 - 295=2433. Still way over. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 271 * 3 = 813. Oh! Wait, 271*3=813. That's exactly the target. So can we get 3 from the remaining numbers 31, 88, 295? Let's see. If 271 * (something) = 813, then that something needs to be 3, which would require 31, 88, 295 to make 3. Let's see. How to get 3 from 31, 88, 295. Let's try:\n\n295 - (88 + 31) = 295 - 119 = 176. That's not 3.\n\nAlternatively, (295 - 88) / 31 = (207)/31 ≈ 6.677. Not 3.\n\nOr (88 - 31) = 57. 57 / something? 57 / 19 = 3. But we don't have 19. Hmm.\n\nWait, 295 divided by something. 295 / 31 ≈ 9.516. Not helpful.\n\nWhat about 88 divided by something. 88 / (295 - 271) = 88 / 24 ≈ 3.666. That's approximately 3.666, which is close to 3.666, but not exact. Let me check:\n\n295 - 271 = 24. Then 88 / 24 = 3.666... So 271 * (88 / (295 - 271)) = 271 * (88/24) ≈ 271 * 3.666 ≈ 994.833. That's over 813. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 271 * (something) where the something is 3. So if I can make 3 from 31, 88, 295. Let's see:\n\nHow about 31 - (295 - 88) = 31 - 207 = -176. No. Not useful.\n\nWait, 88 - 31 = 57. 57 - (295/5) = 57 - 59 = -2. Not helpful. Maybe 295 - 88 = 207. Then 207 / 31 ≈ 6.677. Still not 3.\n\nAnother approach: Let's consider that 271 * 3 = 813. So we need to create 3 using the remaining numbers: 31, 88, 295. How?\n\nWait, 88 divided by 31 is approximately 2.838. If we subtract that from 295 divided by something. Hmm, 295 / x - 88/31 = 3. Let's solve for x:\n\n295/x - 88/31 = 3\n\n295/x = 3 + 88/31 = (93 + 88)/31 = 181/31 ≈5.8387\n\nSo x ≈ 295 / (181/31) ≈ 295 * 31 / 181 ≈ 9145 / 181 ≈50.524. But we don't have a 50.524, only the numbers left. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (295 - 31) / 88 = 264 / 88 = 3. Yes! 295 minus 31 is 264, divided by 88 is exactly 3. Oh! Wait, that works. So:\n\n271 * [(295 - 31)/88] = 271 * 3 = 813.\n\nLet me check:\n\nFirst, 295 - 31 = 264. Then 264 divided by 88 is 3. Then 271 multiplied by 3 is 813. Perfect! And all numbers are used: 271, 295, 31, 88. Each exactly once. So the equation is 271 * ((295 - 31) / 88) = 813. Let me verify the arithmetic steps:\n\n295 - 31 = 264\n\n264 / 88 = 3\n\n271 * 3 = 813. Yep, that's exactly correct. So the equation is 271 × ((295 − 31) ÷ 88) = 813.\n\nSo the answer would be <answer>271 * ((295 - 31) / 88)</answer>\n</think>\n\n<answer>271 * ((295 - 31) / 88)</answer>"}]}

Let me start by thinking about possible combinations.\n\nFirst, I should note that 55 is a relatively small number compared to some of the numbers given, like 60 and 34. Maybe I can subtract some of the larger numbers to get down to 55. Alternatively, combining them through division or multiplication might help adjust the values.\n\nLet me list out the numbers: 7, 60, 34, 22. All need to be used. Let's think about possible operations. Maybe 60 minus something? If I do 60 - 5 = 55, but how do I get 5 from the remaining numbers 7, 34, 22. Hmm. Let's see: 34 - 22 = 12, then 12 -7=5. So 60 - (34 -22 -7) = 60 - (12-7)=60-5=55. Wait, but that uses 34,22,7 to make 5, which is 5. Then 60 -5=55. But does that use all numbers? Let's check: 60 is used, 34,22,7 are used. Yes, all four. But wait, the expression would need to be structured correctly. Let me try writing that as an equation: 60 - (34 -22 -7) =55. But 34 -22 -7 is 5, so 60-5=55. But I need to make sure each number is used once and only once. In this case, 60,34,22,7 are all used once. So that seems to work. Let me check the arithmetic again: 34-22=12, 12-7=5. Then 60-5=55. That's correct. But does the order of operations matter here? Let me write it properly with parentheses. The expression would be 60 - (34 - 22 -7) which simplifies to 60 - (12 -7) =60 -5=55. Yes. So that would be 60 - (34 -22 -7) =55. Let me check if that's a valid equation. But wait, the problem requires using each number exactly once, and all four numbers. Here, yes: 60,34,22,7 are all used once. So that seems to work. But let me verify that all operations are allowed. Subtraction is allowed, and grouping with parentheses. So the equation would be 60 - (34 - 22 -7) =55. But actually, when you compute 34 -22 -7, that's (34-22)=12, then 12-7=5. Then 60-5=55. That's correct. So maybe that's the solution.\n\nAlternatively, maybe another approach. Let's see. What if I combine 22 and 7 first. 22 +7=29. Then 34 -29=5. Then 60-5=55. So that's the same as before, just a different grouping. So 60 - (34 - (22 +7))=55. That's equivalent. So either way, grouping the 22 and7 together. Either 34 -22 -7, or 34 -(22+7). Both result in 5. So 60 -5=55. So the equation would be 60 - (34 -22 -7)=55. Or 60 - (34 - (22 +7))=55. Either way, the numbers are used once each. So that's a possible solution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using multiplication or division. Let's see. For example, 60 divided by something. 60 divided by (something) to get close to 55. 60/1.09≈55, but that's not helpful. Maybe 60 - (34/(22-7)). Let's see: 22-7=15. Then 34/15≈2.266. 60-2.266≈57.733, which is not 55. Not helpful. Or maybe 22 - (60/ (34 -7)). Let's compute denominator:34-7=27. 60/27≈2.222. Then 22-2.222≈19.778. Not 55. Hmm.\n\nAnother approach: let's think about 34 +22=56. That's close to 55. Then 56-1=55. How to get 1 from 60 and7? 7- (60/ something). Wait, 60 divided by 60 is 1, but 60 is already used. Alternatively, 7/7=1, but we can't reuse 7. Alternatively, 60- (7* something)=1. 7*8=56, 60-56=4. Not 1. Hmm. Maybe 60- (7* something else). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, 34 +22=56. Then 56 - (60 / something). Wait, 60 divided by something to get 1. If I do 60/60=1, but 60 is already used. Hmm. Not helpful. Or maybe 56 - (60/12) =56-5=51. Not 55. Hmm.\n\nWait, what if we do 22 +34=56. Then 56 - (60 / (7* something)). Wait, 7 is left. 60 divided by 7 is approximately 8.57. 56 -8.57≈47.43. Not close.\n\nAnother idea: 60 - (22 +7) =60-29=31. Then 34 -31=3. Not helpful. Alternatively, 34 - (60 -22 -7)=34 -31=3. Not useful.\n\nWait, let's think again. The first approach worked. So the equation is 60 - (34 -22 -7) =55. Let me verify:\n\n34 -22 -7 =5. 60-5=55. Yes. So that uses all four numbers once each. The operations are subtraction, subtraction. So that's valid. Therefore, the equation is 60 - (34 -22 -7) =55.

Each number can be used only once, and I can use basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division. Hmm. Let me start by thinking about how these numbers can combine.\n\nFirst, maybe I can look for pairs that could get me closer to 56. Let's list the numbers again: 27, 49, 82, 62. Let me see which pairs might have a relationship that could be useful. For example, 82 and 62 are both even numbers. If I subtract them, 82 - 62 = 20. That's not too helpful. Alternatively, adding them gives 144, which is way too big. Maybe multiplication or division? 82 divided by 62 is roughly 1.32, which doesn't help. 82 multiplied by 62 is way too big, like over 5000. So maybe subtraction or addition isn't the way with those two.\n\nLooking at 49 and 27. 49 minus 27 is 22. That's still below 56. Adding them gives 76. Hmm, 76 is 20 more than 56. If I could subtract 20 from 76, that would work. But how to get 20 from the remaining numbers. Wait, but we have 82 and 62 left. Oh, wait, 82 minus 62 is 20. So maybe 49 + 27 = 76, then subtract (82 - 62) which is 20. So 76 - 20 = 56. Let's check: 49 + 27 - (82 - 62). Let me compute that step by step. First, 82 -62 is 20. Then 49 +27 is 76. 76 -20 is 56. That works! But wait, did I use all the numbers? Let's see: 49, 27, 82, 62. Yes, all four numbers are used once each. So the equation would be (49 + 27) - (82 - 62) = 56. Let me verify again. 82-62 is 20. 49+27 is 76. 76-20 is 56. Yep, that's correct. So that's the equation. Wait, but I need to structure it properly with parentheses to ensure the order of operations. So that should be correct. Let me just check if there's any other way, but this seems straightforward. Let me think if there's another combination. For example, maybe using division or multiplication. Let's see: 82 divided by something. 82 divided by 27 is about 3, which might not help. 62 divided by 27 is about 2.3. 49 divided by 27 is around 1.8. Not sure. Alternatively, maybe 62 - (something). 62 - (49 -27) = 62 -22=40, no. Or 49 * (something). 49* (82-62) = 49*20=980, way too big. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe (82 + 62) - (49 +27) = 144 -76=68. Not 56. Or 82 - (62 + 27) =82 -89= -7, no. 49 * (82 -62) /27. Let's compute that: 49*20=980, 980/27≈36.3. No. Hmm. So the first idea seems the best. So the equation is (49 +27) - (82 -62) =56. That's the correct one. Let me just make sure there's no parentheses missing or order of operations issue. Since subtraction is left associative, but with the parentheses, it's okay.

Let's try 17 and 7. 17 -7 is 10. Then 62 divided by 32 is a little over 1.9. Not sure. If I do 62 / (32) that's about 1.9375. Then adding 10 would be around 11.9, not 20. Not helpful. What about 32 divided by something. 32/16 is 2, but we don't have 16. Hmm. Maybe 7*(something). Let's see. 7*3 is 21, but 3 isn't here. Maybe 62 - (17 + 32) = 62 -49=13. Then 13 +7=20. Wait, that's 62 -17 -32 +7 =20. Which is the same as before. So the equation would be (62 -17 -32) +7 =20. Or 62 -17 -32 +7 =20. Either way, same result. So that seems to work. Let me verify again: 62 -17 is 45, 45 -32 is 13, 13 +7 is 20. Yes. All numbers used once. So that's a valid equation. I think that's the solution. Let me check if there's another possible way, but this seems straightforward.\n</think>\n\n<answer>62 - 17 - 32 + 7 = 20</answer>"}]}

I need to create an equation using the numbers 10, 62, 10, and 38, each exactly once, with basic operations, to get 432. Hmm. Let me start by thinking about how to combine these numbers.\n\nFirst, 432 is a fairly large number. The largest numbers I have are 62 and 38. Maybe multiplying them would help. Let me check: 62 times 38. Let's calculate that. 60*38 is 2280, and 2*38 is 76, so 2280 + 76 = 2356. That's way too big. Hmm, maybe that's not the way.\n\nWait, maybe adding them first. 62 + 38 is 100. That's a nice round number. Then I have the two 10s left. If I can use 100 and the two 10s somehow. Let's think. 100 multiplied by something. 100 * 4 = 400, and we need 432. So maybe 100*4.32. But how to get 4.32 from 10 and 10. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe 100* (10 - something). Wait, but I have to use both 10s. Let's see: If I do 100 * (10 - (10 / something)), but not sure. Wait, maybe 100 * (10 + something). Let's see. Let's try combinations.\n\nWait, if I do 62 + 38 = 100. Then use the two 10s. Maybe 10 * 10 = 100. Then 100 + 100 = 200, which is too low. Not helpful. Alternatively, 100 * 10 = 1000, then maybe subtract 10. 1000 - 10 = 990. Still not 432.\n\nAlternatively, maybe combine 62 and 10 first. 62 * 10 is 620. Then subtract 38 and use the other 10? Let's see: 620 - 38 = 582, then 582 -10 = 572. No, that's not helpful. Or 620 / 10 = 62, which doesn't help. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe 62 * (10 - (something)). Let's see. Let's say 62 multiplied by (38 - 10/10). So 10 divided by 10 is 1, so 38 -1=37. Then 62*37. Let me calculate that: 60*37=2220, 2*37=74, total 2294. That's way over. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 62 * 10 = 620. Then 620 - 38 = 582. Then use the other 10. 582 -10=572. Not useful. How else?\n\nWhat if I do 38 * 10 = 380. Then 380 + 62 = 442. Then subtract 10: 442-10=432. Wait, that works! Let me check: 38*10 is 380. Then add 62: 380 +62=442. Then subtract 10: 442-10=432. But wait, have I used all numbers once? 38, 10, 62, and 10. Yes. Each number is used once. So that would be 38*10 +62 -10 = 432. Let me compute that step by step. 38*10=380. 380+62=442. 442-10=432. Yes! That works. So the equation is (38 × 10) + 62 - 10 = 432. Let me verify again. Numbers used: 38, 10, 62, 10. Each exactly once. Operations: multiplication, addition, subtraction. Perfect. That seems to work.

Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, 649 is a bit less than 650. Maybe I can get close by multiplying some of the larger numbers. Let's look at the numbers given: 55, 59, 7, 35. The two biggest numbers are 55 and 59. If I multiply them, 55*59 would be... let me calculate that. 55*50 is 2750, and 55*9 is 495, so total is 2750+495=3245. That's way too big. So maybe adding them? 55+59=114. Then I still have 35 and 7. Maybe 114* something? Let's see. 114*5 is 570, which is still less than 649. 114*6=684, which is over. Hmm. Maybe 55* something. Let's think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 59 multiplied by 11? Because 59*11 is 649. Wait, exactly! But how do I get 11 from the remaining numbers 55, 7, and 35. Wait, I need to use all four numbers. So if I use 59, then 55, 7, and 35 to make 11. Let me check. Let's see, 55 divided by 5 is 11, but 5 isn't here. Alternatively, 35 divided by something. 35 divided by 7 is 5. Then 55 divided by 5 is 11. Oh! So 55 divided by (35/7) would be 11. Because 35/7 is 5, then 55/5=11. Then 59*11=649. That uses all numbers: 59, 55, 35, 7. Let me check. 35 divided by 7 is 5, then 55 divided by 5 is 11, then 59 times 11. So the equation would be 59 * (55 / (35 / 7)). Let me compute that step by step. 35 divided by 7 is 5. Then 55 divided by 5 is 11. Then 59 times 11 is indeed 649. Yes! So that works. Let me make sure all numbers are used once: 59, 55, 35, 7. All four. And each only once. The operations used are division and multiplication. That should be acceptable. So the equation is 59 * (55 / (35 / 7)).\n</think>\n\n<answer>59 * (55 / (35 / 7))</answer>"}]}

Hmm. Let me think.\n\nFirst, let me check the total if I just add them all up. 81 + 86 is 167, plus 19 is 186, plus 550 is 736. That's way too low. So adding all together isn't enough. Maybe I need to use multiplication or division to get a higher number.\n\nLooking at the numbers, 550 is the largest. If I can multiply 550 by something, that might get me close. Let's see. 550 multiplied by... Maybe 81 divided by something? Wait, 550*1.6 is 880, which is still lower than 903. Hmm. Maybe 550 plus something? Let's see. 550 plus 81 is 631, plus 86 is 717, plus 19 is 736 again. Not helpful.\n\nWhat if I subtract some numbers to get a higher value? For example, 550 multiplied by 2 is 1100, but I don't have a 2. Wait, but maybe using division to create a multiplier. Like 86 divided by 19 is around 4.526. If I multiply that by 550, that's 2489.3, which is way over. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 86 - 19 is 67. Then 550 + 67 is 617, plus 81 is 698. Still not enough. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I can use subtraction in a different way. Let's think: 903 is the target. Let's see, 550 is a big number. If I do 550*2 - something, but how can I get 2 from the remaining numbers? Like 81/(86-19)=81/67≈1.209. Then 550*1.209≈665. Not enough. Alternatively, 86-19=67. 81/67≈1.209.

Wait, but 550 is another number. Let me think differently.\n\nWhat if I do 550* (86/19) ? 86 divided by 19 is approximately 4.526. 550*4.526≈2489.3. Then subtract 81: 2489.3 -81≈2408.3. No, way too high.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 550 + (86*19). Let's calculate 86*19: 80*19=1520, 6*19=114, so total 1634. 550+1634=2184. Then minus 81 is 2103. Still too high.\n\nHmm. Maybe division. Let's see. 550 divided by something. 550/19≈28.947. Then 28.947 +81 +86=195.947. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 86*19=1634. 1634 - 550=1084. 1084 -81=1003. Close but not 903. 1003 is 100 more than 903. Maybe that's a wrong path.\n\nWait, 903 is 1003 -100. But how to get 100 from the numbers left? Not sure.\n\nAnother approach: 81*19=1539. Then 1539 - 86=1453. Then 1453 -550=903. Wait, that works! Let me check:\n\n81 * 19 = 1539\n\n1539 - 86 = 1453\n\n1453 - 550 = 903\n\nBut wait, that uses all numbers: 81, 19, 86, 550.

Let me see what operations can combine these numbers. Maybe start by looking for numbers that are close to the target. The largest number here is 240, which is about 89 less than 329. Hmm, if I can get the remaining numbers to add up to around 89, that might work. Let's check: 33, 97, 41. Wait, 97 is a big number. If I subtract something from 240, maybe?\n\nWait, 240 + 97 is 337, which is 8 more than 329. So 240 + 97 = 337. Then maybe subtract 8? But where can I get 8 from the remaining numbers 33 and 41. 33 - 41 would give me negative, which might not help. Alternatively, 41 - 33 is 8. So maybe 240 + 97 - (41 - 33) = 240 + 97 -8 = 329. Let me check: 240 +97 is 337, then subtract (41-33)=8, so 337-8=329. That works. Let me make sure I used all numbers: 240, 97, 41, 33. Yes, each used once. So the equation would be 240 + 97 - (41 - 33) = 329. Let me write that properly with parentheses. Alternatively, maybe 240 + 97 - 41 +33. Wait, that would be 240 +97=337, then 337-41=296, then +33=329. Wait, that also works. So 240 +97 -41 +33. But does that use all numbers? Let me see: 240, 97, 41, 33. Yes. So that's another way. But which one is correct? Let me check the arithmetic again. 240 +97 is 337. Then 337 -41 is 296. Then 296 +33 is 329. Yes. So that equation would be 240 + 97 -41 +33 = 329. That uses all numbers once with addition and subtraction. That seems valid. Let me confirm each number is used once: 240, 97, 41, 33. Yes. So that's a possible solution. Alternatively, the other way with parentheses: 240 +97 - (41 -33) = 240 +97 -8= 329. Both ways work, but the second approach doesn't require parentheses if you do the operations in order. Wait, but subtraction is left associative, so 240 +97 -41 +33 would be ((240 +97) -41) +33. Let me compute that step by step. 240 +97=337. Then 337-41=296. Then 296+33=329. Correct. So the equation is 240 +97 -41 +33 =329. That's a valid equation using all numbers once. So that's the answer. Let me just check again. 240+97=337, minus 41=296, plus 33=329. Yes.

The largest number is 71, which is a prime number. Then there's 20, 10, and 2. Let's see if combining 71 with another number could get close to 329. For example, 71 multiplied by something. 71*4 is 284, 71*5 is 355. Hmm, 355 is a bit over 329. So if I can get 355 and then subtract 26 (since 355-26=329), but how?\n\nWait, 355 minus 26 is 329. Let's see. If I can get 355 by 71*5, but where would 5 come from? The available numbers are 2,10,20. Maybe 10/2=5. So 71*(10/2) = 71*5 = 355. Then subtract 26. But how to get 26 from the remaining numbers 20 and 20? Wait, I already used 10 and 2. Wait, the numbers must be used once each. So the remaining numbers after using 71,10,2 would be 20. But 355 minus 20 is 335, which is not 329. So that approach isn't working.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 71*4 + something. 71*4=284. 329-284=45. How to get 45 from the remaining numbers 20,10,2. Let's see: 20*2 +10=50. That's too much. 20*2=40 +10=50. Not 45. Maybe 20 + (10*2)=20+20=40. Still not 45. Hmm.\n\nAnother approach: maybe combine 20 and 10 first. 20*10=200. Then 200 + something with 71 and 2. 200 +71=271. Then 271 +2=273. Not close. Or 200*2=400. Then 400-71=329. Wait, 400-71 is 329. But how to get 400. 20*10*2=400. Then subtract 71. Yes! Wait, let's check: 20*10=200, then 200*2=400. Then 400-71=329. But wait, are all numbers used exactly once? Let's see: 20, 10, 2, and 71. Yes. So the equation would be (20 * 10 * 2) - 71 = 329. Let me check the calculation: 20*10 is 200, times 2 is 400. 400-71=329. Exactly. So that works. So the equation is 20*10*2 -71 = 329. Let me make sure that's allowed. Each number is used once: 20, 10, 2, 71. All operations are multiplication and subtraction. So yes. That should be the correct equation.\n</think>\n\n<answer>20 * 10 * 2 - 71 = 329</answer>"}]}

Let me see which numbers could multiply to get close. The largest number in the set is 92. If I multiply 92 by something else, maybe that will help.

Maybe 92 multiplied by 9.5 would get us 874, since 92*9 = 828, 92*10=920, so halfway between 9 and 10 (9.5) would be 92*9.5=874. But do I have a way to get 9.5 from the remaining numbers? The remaining numbers would be 19, 8, 16. Let's see. If I subtract 8 from 19, that's 11. 11 plus 16 is 27. Not helpful. Alternatively, 16 divided by 8 is 2, then 19 minus 2 is 17. Still not 9.5. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 19 - (16/8) = 19 - 2 = 17. Then 92 * 17 is 1564, which is way over. Not helpful. Maybe that's not the right approach.\n\nWait, another thought. What if I use 92 and 19 together? 92 multiplied by 19 is 1748, which is double the target. If I can somehow divide that by 2, but I don't have a 2. But I have 8 and 16. 16 divided by 8 is 2. So 92 * 19 / (16 / 8). Let's compute that: 92*19 = 1748, 16/8=2, so 1748 / 2 = 874. Oh! That works. Let me check again: 92 multiplied by 19 is 1748. Then divide by (16 divided by 8). Since 16 divided by 8 is 2, 1748 divided by 2 is indeed 874. And all numbers are used once: 92, 19, 16, 8. So the equation would be 92 * 19 / (16 / 8) = 874. Let me just make sure that order of operations is respected. The division in the denominator would happen first, so 16/8 is 2, then 92*19 is 1748, divided by 2 is 874. Yes, that works. So that's the equation.\n</think>\n\n<answer>92 * 19 / (16 / 8) = 874</answer>"}]}

So I need 132 from the remaining numbers, which are 38 and 32. How can I get 132 from 38 and 32? Let's see: 38 + 32 is 70, which is too low. 38 * 32 is 1216, way too high. 38 - 32 is 6. 32 - 38 is -6. So that's not helpful. Maybe dividing? 38/32 is about 1.1875. 32/38 is around 0.842. Still not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 38 * 3.5 is 133, but I don't have a 3.5. Wait, maybe 32 divided by something? Let's think differently. Maybe I can combine 38 and 32 in a way that gives me 132 when multiplied by something else, but since we have to use all numbers, perhaps there's another approach.\n\nWait, maybe start with a different combination. Let's see 38 and 32. If I subtract them, 38 - 32 = 6. Then 64 * 11 is 704, and 704 + 6 = 710. Not enough. Alternatively, 38 + 32 = 70. 70 * 11 = 770. Then 770 + 64 = 834. Close, but 2 short. Hmm.\n\nWhat if I do 38 * 32? That's 1216. Then 1216 - 64 = 1152. 1152 / 11 is about 104.7, not helpful. Or maybe 1216 - (64 * 11) = 1216 - 704 = 512. Not 836.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 64 * 32 = 2048. Then 2048 - 11 = 2037. Then 2037 - 38 = 1999. Nope, way off.\n\nWait, what's 836 divided by 11? Let me check. 11*76=836. Oh, right? Because 11*70=770, 11*6=66, so 770+66=836. So 11*76=836. So maybe if I can make 76 from the remaining numbers: 64, 38, 32. Hmm. How?\n\n64 + 38 = 102. 102 - 32 = 70. Not 76. 64 - 38 = 26. 26 +32=58. No. 38 +32=70, 70 +64=134. No. Maybe (64 +32) =96. 96 -38=58. Still no. Alternatively, 64 - (38 -32)=64-6=58. Still not 76. Hmm.\n\nWait, 64 + (38 -32) =64+6=70. No. How else? What if I multiply? 38*2=76, but I don't have a 2. Wait, but maybe 32 divided by something gives 2. Like 32/16=2, but I don't have 16. Alternatively, 64 divided by 32 is 2. So maybe 38 * (64/32) =38*2=76. Ah! Then 76*11=836. So that uses all numbers: 11, 64, 32, 38. Let me check:\n\n38 multiplied by (64 divided by 32) equals 38*(2)=76. Then 76 multiplied by 11 equals 836. Let's verify:\n\n64 /32 =2\n\n38*2=76\n\n76*11=836\n\nYes! So the equation is 11 * (38 * (64 /32)) = 836. But we need to write it using all numbers once each, with each operation. Let's structure it properly. Since all operations must be used, but each number once. So the equation would be 11 × 38 × (64 ÷ 32) = 836. Let's compute:\n\n64 ÷32 =2\n\n38 ×2 =76\n\n76 ×11=836. Perfect. So the equation is (11 × 38) × (64 ÷ 32) =836. Alternatively, 11 × 38 × (64 /32) =836. That uses all numbers once, each operation allowed. Let me check if parentheses are needed. The order would be division first, then multiplication. So 64/32 is 2, then 38*2=76, then 76*11=836. So the equation could be written as 11 * 38 * (64 / 32) =836. That's correct. So that's the answer.\n</think>\n\n<answer>11 * 38 * (64 / 32) = 836</answer>"}]}

I need to use all the numbers 91, 74, 95, and 61 exactly once each with basic arithmetic operations to get 17. Hmm. Let's start by thinking about possible combinations.\n\nFirst, 17 is a relatively small number compared to these, so maybe division or subtraction will be involved to reduce larger numbers. Let's consider the largest numbers first. 95 and 91 are the biggest. If I subtract them: 95 - 91 = 4. That's a small number. Then maybe use that result with the other numbers. But how?\n\nWait, maybe combining 95 and 74. Let's see. 95 minus 74 is 21. Then 21 minus something else. But then I have 61 and 91 left. If I take 21 - (91/61), but that's not going to be an integer. Hmm. Alternatively, 74 - 61 = 13. Then 95 - 91 = 4. 13 + 4 = 17. Oh, wait! That might work. But wait, I need to use all four numbers in a single equation. So maybe (74 - 61) + (95 - 91) = 13 + 4 = 17. But does that use all four numbers? Yes: 74,61,95,91. Each used once. But the problem says to create an equation using all numbers with operations. So the equation would be (74 - 61) + (95 - 91) = 17. Let me check that. 74 minus 61 is 13, 95 minus 91 is 4, 13 plus 4 is 17. Yes. But how to structure the equation using all numbers in one expression. So maybe ((74 - 61) + (95 - 91)) = 17. But the way to combine them is with operations. Alternatively, maybe another arrangement. Let's verify:\n\nAnother approach: 91 - (74 + 61 + 95). No, that would be way negative. Not helpful. How about division? For example, 95 divided by something. 95 / 5 = 19. But I don't have a 5. Wait, maybe 95 divided by (something) minus another number. Let's see. 95 / (74 - 61) = 95/13 ≈7.3. Then maybe 91 - (95/13) ≈ 83.7, not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 91 - (74 + 61) = 91 - 135 = -44. Then adding 95: -44 +95=51. Not 17. Hmm.\n\nWhat if I multiply: 61 * something. Let's see. 61 * 1 =61. 95 - 61=34. Then 74 - 34=40. Not helpful.\n\nWait, another angle: (95 - 74) =21. Then 21 - (91 / 61). 91 divided by 61 is approximately 1.49. 21 -1.49≈19.5. Close to 17 but not quite. Not exact.\n\nAlternatively, 74 - (95 - (91 -61)). Let's compute inside out: 91-61=30. Then 95-30=65. Then 74-65=9. Not 17.\n\nHmm. What if we group 91 and 61 first. 91 -61=30. Then 95 -74=21. 30 -21=9. Still no.\n\nAlternatively, 91 divided by something. 91/7=13, but how to get 7 from 74,95,61. Maybe 74 - (95-61)=74-34=40. 91/40=2.275. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe using multiplication and subtraction. Let's try 95 - (74 + 61) =95 -135= -40. Then -40 +91=51. Still not.\n\nWhat about (95 -91) =4. Then 74 - (61 +4)=74-65=9. Not 17.\n\nWait, earlier thought: (74 -61) + (95 -91)=13 +4=17. That seems to work. Let's check again. 74-61=13. 95-91=4. 13+4=17. All four numbers used once. So the equation would be (74 - 61) + (95 - 91) =17. So that's possible. Let me make sure there's no other combination. Alternatively, maybe some other arrangement with division.\n\nFor example, (95 -74) * (61 -91). That's 21 * (-30)= -630. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 95 - (74 + 61 +91)=95-226= -131. Not.\n\nAnother idea: 91 - (95 - (74 -61)). Let's compute inner parentheses first:74-61=13. Then 95-13=82. 91-82=9. No.\n\nWait, maybe using division in a clever way. For instance, 95 divided by 5 is 19, but again, getting 5 from other numbers. 74 - 61=13. 95 /13 is about 7.3. 91 -74=17. Wait, 91 -74=17, but that uses 91 and 74, leaving 95 and 61 unused. So that's not allowed. But maybe (91 -74) + (95 -61). 17 +34=51. Not 17.\n\nAlternatively, (91 - (95 /5 )) but again, need a 5. How else? Maybe 95 divided by (something). Let's see: 95 divided by (74 -61) =95/13≈7.3. Then 91 -7.3≈83.7, which isn't 17.\n\nAlternatively, 61 - (95 / (91 -74)). Let's compute denominator:91-74=17. Then 95/17≈5.588. 61-5.588≈55.412. Not 17.\n\nHmm. Let's go back to the original idea where (74 -61) + (95 -91) gives 17. That seems to work. Let's check again: 74 minus61 is 13, 95 minus91 is 4. 13 plus4 is 17. All numbers used once. So the equation is (74 - 61) + (95 - 91) =17. That's valid. But maybe the problem expects the equation to be written with operations combining all four numbers in a single expression without separate parentheses. Wait, but the example given in the problem is (1 +2)/3, which uses three numbers. So in this case, we need to use all four. So perhaps combining them in a way that uses all four. The solution I found uses two subtractions and an addition. So (74-61)+(95-91). But each number is used once. So that's acceptable. Let me check the rules again: each number can be used once, all must be used, and operations can be used multiple times. So this equation satisfies all conditions. Therefore, the answer is ((74 - 61) + (95 - 91)) =17, but the equation would be written as (74 - 61) + (95 - 91) =17. But maybe the way to write it is using all four numbers in the equation. So yes, that works. I think that's the solution.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(74 - 61) + (95 - 91) = 17</answer>"}]}

Or maybe 78 * (something) plus another number.\n\nWait, 78 * 2 is 156, and 156 + 14 is 170. How to get 14 from 32, 8, 35. Let's see: 35 - (32 / 8). 32 divided by 8 is 4, so 35 - 4 is 31. Not 14. Alternatively, 35 - 32 is 3, then 3 + 8 is 11. Still not 14. Maybe 32 - 8 is 24, then 35 - 24 is 11. Not helpful.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe 35 * 5 is 175, which is close to 170. How to get 5 from other numbers. 32 divided by 8 is 4, then 78 - 4 is 74. Not helpful. Or 78 - (32/8) = 78 -4=74. Then 74 +35=109. No. Not there.\n\nWait, 78 + 35 is 113. Then 32 and 8 left.

Let's see, 35 * 5 is 175. But again, getting 5. Hmm.\n\nWait, 32 * 5 is 160. 160 +10=170. How to get 10 from 78,8,35. Maybe 78 / 8 is 9.75, and 35 -9.75 is 25.25. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe combining division and multiplication. Like (78 - 8) * something. 78-8=70. 70 * 2.428...=170. But that would need a fraction, and I don't see how to get that with 32 and 35. Maybe 70 * (35/32). Let's check: 70 *35=2450, divided by 32 is 76.5625. Not 170.\n\nHmm. Maybe using subtraction and multiplication. Let's think of 170 as 32*5 + 35 + something. Wait, 32*5=160. 160+10=170. Wait, but 35 is there. 35- (something)=10. So 35 -25=10. How to get 25 from 78 and 8. 78-8=70. Not 25. 78/8=9.75. Not helpful. Maybe 8*3=24, but where's the 3?\n\nAlternatively, maybe (78 + 32) * something. 78+32=110. 110 * something =170.

I need to create an equation using the numbers 12, 39, 39, and 75, each exactly once, with basic operations to get 900. Hmm. First, let me think about the target number, 900. It's a large number, so maybe multiplication will be involved here. Let's check the factors of 900. 900 is 9*100, 30*30, 25*36, etc. Maybe I can get two numbers that multiply to 900, but I have to use all four numbers.\n\nLooking at the numbers given: 12, 39, 39, 75. Let's see their approximate sizes. 75 is the largest, followed by 39s, then 12. Let me try combining 75 and 12 first. 75 times 12 is 900. Wait, that's exactly the target! But wait, that uses only two numbers. I have to use all four. So maybe I can get 75*12 as part of the equation and then somehow incorporate the two 39s. But since each number can be used once, I need to use both 39s and the other numbers. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe subtract or add the other numbers in a way that the total becomes 900. Let me try different combinations. Let's see:\n\nIf 75 * 12 is 900, but I need to use the two 39s. Maybe 39 - 39 = 0, then adding that to 75*12 would keep it 900. So (75 * 12) + (39 - 39) = 900 + 0 = 900. That uses all numbers. But is that allowed? The problem says each number can only be used once. Wait, but in this case, we're using each number once: 75, 12, 39, and 39. The two 39s are used once each. So that works. Let me check: (75 * 12) + (39 - 39) = 900 + 0 = 900. Yes, that seems to fit. But let me verify if the operations are allowed. The problem says you can use basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) one or multiple times. So adding and subtracting is okay. \n\nBut wait, maybe the user expects all numbers to be part of the main operations, but the problem statement doesn't specify that. The instructions just say each number can be used once and all must be used. So this equation would satisfy the conditions. Let me write it out: (75 × 12) + (39 − 39) = 900. That uses all four numbers once each. \n\nAlternatively, maybe another approach. Let's see if there's another combination. For example, 39 + 39 is 78. Then 78 multiplied by something. 78 × 12 is 936. 936 is higher than 900. Subtract 75 - 12 = 63. 936 - 63 = 873. Not 900. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, 75 - 12 = 63. 63 multiplied by something. 63 × 14 = 882, but that's not helpful. \n\nWait, another idea: 75 + 39 = 114. Then 114 multiplied by something. 114 × 8 = 912, but not helpful. Maybe divide. Let's see. 114 divided by something. Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, 39 × 75 = 2925. That's way too big. 2925 divided by something. 2925 / 12 is 243.75, not helpful. \n\nWhat if I combine 39 and 39 first. 39 * 39 is 1521. Then 1521 - 75 = 1446. Then 1446 - 12 = 1434. Not close. \n\nWait, perhaps using division. Let's think. If I can get 900 by multiplying 12 and 75, which is 900, but then have to use the two 39s. So maybe 39 divided by 39 is 1, then multiply by 12 and 75. Wait, but that would be (39/39) * 75 *12 = 900. But this uses all numbers: 39 once, 39 once, 75 once, 12 once. So that's (75 × 12) × (39 ÷ 39) = 900 × 1 = 900. That also works. \n\nSo there are two possible equations here: either adding (39 -39) which is zero, or multiplying by (39/39) which is 1. Both methods use all four numbers once. Let me check if these are acceptable. The problem allows using operations multiple times, and each number once. Both equations fit. \n\nSo either (75 * 12) + (39 - 39) or (75 * 12) * (39 / 39). Both are valid. But perhaps the second one is more efficient. Let me confirm the arithmetic. 75 times 12 is indeed 900. Then 39 divided by 39 is 1. Multiplying them gives 900. So the equation would be (75 * 12) * (39 / 39) = 900. \n\nAlternatively, the problem might prefer not having the 1 multiplied, but either way, both equations are correct. I think both are valid, but maybe the second one is more concise. But the question says to return one equation, so I can choose either. Let me check the problem statement again. It says \"create an equation that equals 900\" using all numbers once. Either equation works. Maybe the user expects a particular one, but both are correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe another combination exists. Let me think. Suppose we do 39 + 39 = 78. Then 78 * 12 = 936. Then 936 - 75 = 861. Not 900. Or 75 * (39 - (39 / 12)). Wait, but that would use 39, 39, 12 in division, but then 75 times something. Let's calculate: 39/12 is 3.25. Then 39 - 3.25 is 35.75. 75 * 35.75 = 2681.25, not 900. \n\nAnother approach: 75 + 39 = 114. 114 * 39 = 4446. 4446 divided by 12 is 370.5. No. \n\nAlternatively, 75 - 39 = 36. 36 * (something). 36 * 25 is 900. How to get 25 from remaining numbers 12 and 39? 39 - 12 = 27. 27 + something? Not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, 39 * 12 = 468. Then 468 + 75 = 543. Then 543 + 39 = 582. Not helpful. \n\nHmm. So the two possibilities are the ones where the 39s cancel each other out, either through subtraction or division. Let me check the problem statement again. The user allows using each number once. Since both 39s are used once each, either equation is valid. So the answer could be either (75*12)+(39-39) or (75*12)*(39/39). \n\nBut maybe the first one is better because addition and subtraction are lower precedence, but actually, in the second case, multiplication and division have higher precedence, so parentheses are needed. \n\nAlternatively, let me check if the user has any preferences. Since both are valid, I can present one. Let's go with the division one because it's more elegant. So the equation would be (75 * 12) * (39 / 39) = 900. \n\nYes, that works.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(75 * 12) * (39 / 39) = 900</answer>"}]}

Let me see. 544 divided by 34 is 16. So if I can get 16 from 3, 51, and 99. But 51 and 99 are big. Alternatively, 544 divided by 51 is approximately 10.666. Hmm. Not sure. Maybe subtract some numbers?\n\nAlternatively, think about 99 and 34. 99 minus 34 is 65. Then 65 multiplied by something. Let's see. If I do (99 - 34) that's 65. Then 65 * 8.37 is about 544, but I don't have 8.37. Wait, maybe 65*8 is 520, which is close. But how to get 8 from 3 and 51? 51 divided by 3 is 17. 17 minus something? Not helpful. Alternatively, 51 minus 3 is 48. 48 divided by something? 48/6 is 8. But I don't have 6. Hmm.\n\nWait, another approach: Maybe 99 + 51 is 150. Then 150 times 3 is 450. 450 plus 34 is 484. Not enough. 99*3 is 297. 297 plus 51 is 348. 348 plus 34 is 382. Still not there.\n\nWhat if I do 51*3 which is 153. Then 153 + 99 is 252. 252* something. 252*2.16 is 544. But how to get 2.16 from 34. Maybe 34 divided by 16. But again, not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of 544 as 34 multiplied by 16. So 34*16=544. So how to get 16 from 3, 51, and 99. Let's see: 51 - 3 is 48. 48 divided by 3 is 16. Wait, but I already used 3. Wait, but we have to use each number once. So if I do (51 - (99/3)), that might work. Let me calculate that. 99 divided by 3 is 33. Then 51 - 33 is 18. Then 34*18 is 612. Not 544. Not helpful.\n\nWait, but if I want 16, maybe (99 - 51) divided by 3. (99-51)=48. 48/3=16. Then 34*16=544. Oh! That could work. Let me check:\n\nFirst, 99 minus 51 is 48. Then 48 divided by 3 is 16. Then 34 multiplied by 16 is 544. So the equation would be 34 * ((99 - 51) / 3) = 544. Let's verify:\n\n99 - 51 = 48\n\n48 / 3 = 16\n\n34 * 16 = 544. Yes! That works. All numbers are used once: 34, 99, 51, 3. Each is used once. The operations are subtraction, division, and multiplication. Perfect.\n</think>\n\n<answer>34 * ((99 - 51) / 3)</answer>"}]}
