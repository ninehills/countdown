Let's see, 98 minus 14 is 84, but that's still bigger than 67. If I subtract 93 from 98, that's 5. Then maybe add 14 and 3? Wait, but I have to use all numbers. Let me write down the numbers: 93, 14, 3, 98.\\n\\nAnother approach: maybe combine some numbers with multiplication or division. Let's see, 14 divided by 3 is roughly 4.666, but not sure if that helps. What if I do 93 minus something? 93 minus 14 is 79, which is still higher than 67. Then maybe subtract 3 and 98? Wait, but I can't do that because all numbers must be used once. Wait, maybe I need to group them into different operations.\\n\\nWait, what if I take 98 and subtract 3, which is 95. Then subtract something else. If I subtract 93 from 95, that's 2. Then add 14? 2 +14 is 16. No, that's not 67. Hmm.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe 98 divided by something. 98 divided by 14 is 7. Then 7 multiplied by 3 is 21. Then 93 minus 21 is 72. Not 67. Close though. Maybe different operations.\\n\\nWhat about 93 minus (14 + 3) which is 93 -17=76. Then 98 -76=22. Not helpful. Wait, but I need to use all numbers. So maybe 98 - (93 - 14) /3. Let's check: 93-14=79. 79 divided by 3 is about 26.333. Then 98-26.333=71.666, which is not 67.\\n\\nWait, maybe 93 - (98 - 14)/3.
